thermal excitations out of the ground state. While the presence of energy gaps
between the ground and excited states suppresses such excitations, error
correction techniques are required to ensure full scalability of quantum
annealing. Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that aims to improve
the performance of quantum annealers when control over only the problem (final)
Hamiltonian is possible, along with decoding. Building on our earlier work [S.
Matsuura et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 220501 (2016)], we study QAC using
analytical tools of statistical physics by considering the effects of
temperature and a transverse field on the penalty qubits in the ferromagnetic
$p$-body infinite-range transverse-field Ising model. We analyze the effect of
QAC on second ($p=2$) and first ($p\geq 3$) order phase transitions, and
construct the phase diagram as a function of temperature and penalty strength.
Our analysis reveals that for sufficiently low temperatures and in the absence
of a transverse field on the penalty qubit, QAC breaks up a single, large free
energy barrier into multiple smaller ones. We find theoretical evidence for an
optimal penalty strength in the case of a transverse field on the penalty
qubit, a feature observed in QAC experiments. Our results provide further
compelling evidence that QAC provides an advantage over unencoded quantum
annealing.

developed to reconstruct an unknown $n$-dimensional real-/complex-valued signal

$\psi_i=|\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle|$. This problem, also known as phase
retrieval from magnitude-only information, is \emph{NP-hard} in general.
Adopting an amplitude-based nonconvex formulation, STAF leads to an iterative
solver comprising two stages: s1) Orthogonality-promoting initialization
through a stochastic variance reduced gradient algorithm; and, s2) A series of
iterative refinements of the initialization using stochastic truncated gradient
iterations. Both stages involve a single equation per iteration, thus rendering
STAF a simple, scalable, and fast approach amenable to large-scale
implementations that is useful when $n$ is large. When $\{\bm{a}_i\}_{i=1}^m$
are independent Gaussian, STAF provably recovers exactly any
$\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ exponentially fast based on order of $n$ quadratic
equations. STAF is also robust in the presence of additive noise of bounded
support. Simulated tests involving real Gaussian $\{\bm{a}_i\}$ vectors
demonstrate that STAF empirically reconstructs any $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$
exactly from about $2.3n$ magnitude-only measurements, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches and narrowing the gap from the

existence of a second moment of the degree distribution is assumed. As a second
main contribution, paralleling regulatory discussions, we determine minimal
capital requirements for financial institutions sufficient to make the network
resilient to small shocks. An appealing feature of these capital requirements
is that they can be determined locally by each institution without knowing the

tasks can be largely attributed to the recent development and advancement of
program characterization, a process that numerically or structurally quantifies
a target program. While great achievements have been made in identifying key
features to characterize programs, choosing a correct set of features for a
specific compiler task remains an ad hoc procedure. In order to guarantee a
comprehensive coverage of features, compiler engineers usually need to select
excessive number of features. This, unfortunately, would potentially lead to a
selection of multiple similar features, which in turn could create a new
problem of bias that emphasizes certain aspects of a program's characteristics,
hence reducing the accuracy and performance of the target compiler task. In
this paper, we propose FEAture Selection for compilation Tasks (FEAST), an
efficient and automated framework for determining the most relevant and
representative features from a feature pool. Specifically, FEAST utilizes
widely used statistics and machine-learning tools, including LASSO, sequential
forward and backward selection, for automatic feature selection, and can in
general be applied to any numerical feature set. This paper further proposes an
automated approach to compiler parameter assignment for assessing the
performance of FEAST. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that, under
the compiler parameter assignment task, FEAST can achieve comparable results
with about 18% of features that are automatically selected from the entire
feature pool. We also inspect these selected features and discuss their roles
in program execution.

the antennas that capture little signal energy and mostly noise. Simulation
results show that, depending on the unquantized link SNR, a power saving in the

different dust ion acoustic solitary structures in an unmagnetized
collisionless dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains,
adiabatic warm ions, nonthermal electrons and isothermal positrons in a more
generalized form by considering nonthermal positrons instead of isothermal
positrons. The present system supports both positive and negative potential
double layers, coexistence of solitary waves of both polarities and positive
potential supersolitons. The qualitative and the quantitative changes in
existence domains of different solitary structures which occur for the presence
of nonthermal positrons have been presented in comparison with the results of
Paul & Bandyopadhyay [Astrophys. Space Sci. 361, 172(2016)]. The formation of
supersoliton structures and their limitations have been analyzed with the help
of phase portraits of the dynamical system corresponding to the dust ion
acoustic solitary structures. Phase portrait analysis clearly indicates a
smooth transition between soliton and supersoliton.

waves. Such waves form due to the synergistic effect of dispersive mixing of
smaller wave groups and the action of localized nonlinear wave interactions
that leads to focusing. Instead of a direct simulation approach, we rely on the
decomposition of the wave field into a discrete set of localized wave groups
with optimal length scales and amplitudes. Due to the short-term character of
the prediction, these wave groups do not interact and therefore their dynamics
can be characterized individually. Using direct numerical simulations of the
governing envelope equations we precompute the expected maximum elevation for
each of those wave groups. The combination of the wave field decomposition
algorithm, which provides information about the statistics of the system, and
the precomputed map for the expected wave group elevation, which encodes
dynamical information, allows (i) for understanding of how the probability of
occurrence of rogue waves changes as the spectrum parameters vary, (ii) the
computation of a critical length scale characterizing wave groups with high
probability of evolving to rogue waves, and (iii) the formulation of a robust
and parsimonious reduced-order prediction scheme for large waves. We assess the
validity of this scheme in several cases of ocean wave spectra.

from a nonreciprocal induced transparency based on a coherent light-sound

deposit positrons onto the surface of samples consisting of single layer

emitted from the samples as a result of the annihilation of the positron showed
peak extending up to ~12 eV with a maximum at ~4eV. The observed peak was ~17
times larger than the previously observed annihilation induced C KVV peak. An
analysis based upon a density functional theory calculation of the positron
annihilation rates indicates that the width and intensity of the peak is
consistent with electron emission resulting from VVV Auger transition excited
by the annihilation of valence band electrons. Good agreement was found between
the data from the single layer graphene on Cu surface with a theoretical line
shape found from a self-folding of the density of states for a free standing
graphene layer. The agreement between the theoretical and measured intensities
for the KVV and VVV transitions indicates that the branching ratio for holes to
decay via an Auger transition is nearly the same in both cases (i.e. close to
100%). Our results suggest the possibility of using annihilation induced VVV
Auger spectroscopy to study the properties of the local density of states and
the hole decay processes in materials in which the valence band width exceeds

the subcritical and supercritical regimes. Since solutions to this equation
exhibit, respectively, globally well-posed behavior and finite-time blow-up in
these two regimes, this makes it a useful model to study the maximum
instantaneous growth of enstrophy possible in these two distinct situations.
First, we obtain estimates on the rates of growth and then show that these
estimates are sharp up to numerical prefactors. This is done by numerically
solving suitably defined constrained maximization problems and then
demonstrating that for different values of the fractional dissipation exponent
the obtained maximizers saturate the upper bounds in the estimates as the
enstrophy increases. We conclude that the power-law dependence of the enstrophy
rate of growth on the fractional dissipation exponent has the same global form
in the subcritical, critical and parts of the supercritical regime. This
indicates that the maximum enstrophy rate of growth changes smoothly as global
well-posedness is lost when the fractional dissipation exponent attains
supercritical values. In addition, nontrivial behavior is revealed for the
maximum rate of growth of the fractional enstrophy obtained for small values of
the fractional dissipation exponents. We also characterize the structure of the
maximizers in different cases.

shock solutions, while, if the relaxation time is small enough and the doping
profile is a subsonic constant, then the equations admits infinitely many $C^1$
smooth transonic solutions, and no transonic shock solution exists. When the
doping profile is supersonic, we show that the system does not hold any
subsonic solution, furthermore, the system doesn't admit any supersonic

the prediction of turbulence and transport in magnetized plasma come mainly
from the use of very CPU-consuming particle-in-cell or (gyro)kinetic codes
which naturally include non-Maxwellian kinetic effects. To date, fluid codes
are not considered to be relevant for the description of these kinetic effects.
Here, after revisiting the limitations of the current fluid theory developed in
the 19th century, we generalize the fluid theory including kinetic effects such
as non-Maxwellian super-thermal tails with as few fluid equations as possible.
The collisionless and collisional fluid closures from the nonlinear Landau
Fokker-Planck collision operator are shown for an arbitrary collisionality.
Indeed, the first fluid models associated with two examples of collisionless
fluid closures are obtained by assuming an analytic non-Maxwellian distribution
function (e.g., the INMDF [O. Izacard, Phys. Plasmas 23, 082504 (2016)]). One
of the main differences with the literature is our analytic representation of
the distribution function in the velocity phase space with as few hidden
variables as possible thanks to the use of non-orthogonal basis sets. These new
non-Maxwellian fluid equations could initiate the next generation of fluid
codes including kinetic effects and can be expanded to other scientific
disciplines such as astrophysics, condensed matter, or hydrodynamics. As a
validation test, we perform a numerical simulation based on a minimal reduced
INMDF fluid model. The result of this test is the discovery of the origin of
particle and heat diffusion. The diffusion is due to the competition between a
growing INMDF on short time scales due to spatial gradients and the
thermalization on longer time scales. The results shown here could draw the

  Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and
atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window

the mobility monotonously increases with the diameter, not yet showing any
saturated behavior. We also find that, while the bulk InSb mobility is

We empirically demonstrate a new form of variation that exists within a real

DRAM chip. Our goals are to understand design-induced variation that exists in
real, state-of-the-art DRAM chips, exploit it to develop low-cost mechanisms
that can dynamically find and use the lowest latency at which to operate a DRAM
chip reliably, and, thus, improve overall system performance while ensuring
reliable system operation.
  To this end, we first experimentally demonstrate and analyze designed-induced
variation in modern DRAM devices by testing and characterizing 96 DIMMs (768
DRAM chips). Our characterization identifies DRAM regions that are vulnerable
to errors, if operated at lower latency, and finds consistency in their
locations across a given DRAM chip generation, due to design-induced variation.
Based on our extensive experimental analysis, we develop two mechanisms that
reliably reduce DRAM latency. First, DIVA Profiling uses runtime profiling to
dynamically identify the lowest DRAM latency that does not introduce failures.
DIVA Profiling exploits design-induced variation and periodically profiles only
the vulnerable regions to determine the lowest DRAM latency at low cost. Our
second mechanism, DIVA Shuffling, shuffles data such that values stored in
vulnerable regions are mapped to multiple error-correcting code (ECC)
codewords. Combined together, our two mechanisms reduce read/write latency by
40.0%/60.5%, which translates to an overall system performance improvement of
14.7%/13.7%/13.8% (in 2-/4-/8-core systems) across a variety of workloads,

the weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized

on the emissivity and temperature of a body, and increases monotonically with
temperature rise at any emitted wavelength. Nonthermal radiation, such as
photoluminescence (PL), is a fundamental light matter interaction that
conventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,
and the emission of a redshifted photon. Until recently, the role of rate
conservation when thermal excitation is significant, has not been studied in
any nonthermal radiation. A question: What is the overall emission rate if a
high quantum efficiency (QE), PL material, is heated to a temperature where it
thermally emits a rate of 50 photons/sec at its bend edge, while in parallel is
PL excited at a rate of 100 photons/sec. Recently, we discovered that the
answer is an overall rate of 100 blueshifted photons/sec. In contrast to
thermal emission, the PL rate is conserved with temperature increase, while
each photon is blueshifted. Further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt
transition to thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. These
findings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump. Here we study, for the
first time, the emission rate of PL radiation at moderate QE where nonradiative
processes dominate the dynamics. Though conservation of photon rate does not
apply, we predict that the emission rate at 100% QE is an upper limit for the
overall emission rate regardless of the QE. Also, the transition temperature to
thermal emission is QE independent.

uncertainty principle (TEUP) bounds the efficiency of energy measurements,
relating the duration ($\Delta t$) of the measurement, and its accuracy error
($\Delta E$) by $\Delta t\Delta E \ge$ 1/2. In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a
counterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under
certain conditions the principle holds. Can we classify when and to what extent
the TEUP is violated?
  Our main theorem asserts that such violations are in one to one
correspondence with the ability to ""fast forward"" the associated Hamiltonian,
namely, to simulate its evolution for time $t$ using much less than $t$ quantum
gates. This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms.
Our theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the
computational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration ($\Delta t$) is
replaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement,
and we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the
totality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement. The
inspiration for this result is a family of Hamiltonians we construct, based on
Shor's algorithm, which exponentially violate the cTEUP (and the TEUP), thus
allowing exponential fast forwarding.
  We further show that commuting local Hamiltonians and quadratic Hamiltonians
of fermions (e.g., Anderson localization model), can be fast forwarded. The
work raises the question of finding a physical criterion for fast forwarding,
in particular, can many body localization systems be fast forwarded? We rule
out a general fast-forwarding method for all physically realizable Hamiltonians
(unless BQP=PSPACE). Connections to quantum metrology and to Susskind's

  Detection","This paper is submitted",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave provides a promising approach for meeting the ever-growing
traffic demand in next generation wireless networks. It is crucial to obtain
relatively accurate channel state information so that beamforming/combining can
be performed to compensate for severe path loss in this band. In contrast to
lower frequencies, a typical mobile millimeter wave channel consists of a few
dominant paths. It is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains, angles
of departure (AoD), and angles of arrival (AoA) of those paths. In this paper,
multiple transmit and receive antennas and beamforming with a single baseband
processing chain are assumed. We propose a framework for estimating millimeter
wave channels with intermittent abrupt changes (e.g., blockage or emergence of
dominant paths) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs. The solution consists of
three components: tracking of the slow channel variations, detection of abrupt
changes, followed by (re-)acquisition of channel (and back to the tracking
stage). For acquisition, we formulate a least squares problem and find its
solution based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To track slow variations
of AoDs and AoAs, we propose a new approach using Kalman filtering. Finally, an
algorithm based on a likelihood test is devised for detecting abrupt changes.
Simulation results show that, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios, the
proposed scheme can achieve more than 8 dB higher estimation accuracy than
several other methods using the same number of pilots.

hydrolysis serves as the energy source for a wide range of intracellular
processes including the assurance for decision-making. In the fission yeast
cell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to M phase is triggered by the
activation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25, and the deactivation of Wee1. Each of these
three events involves a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PdP) cycle, and
together they form a regulatory circuit with feedback loops. Almost all
quantitative models for cellular networks in the past have invalid
thermodynamics due to the assumption of irreversible enzyme kinetics. We
constructed a thermodynamically realistic kinetic model of the G2/M circuit,
and show that the phosphorylation energy ($\Delta G$), which is determined by
the cellular ATP/ADP ratio, critically controls the dynamics and the bistable
nature of Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we
are able to experimentally verify our model prediction that increased , being
synergistic to the accumulation of Cdc13, drives the activation of Cdc2.
Furthermore, Cdc2 activation exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to
changes in phosphorylation energy. These findings suggest that adequate
maintenance of phosphorylation energy ensures the bistability and robustness of
the activation of Cdc2 in the G2/M transition. Free energy might play a
widespread role in biological decision-making processes, connecting

  Statistical Society: Series B",,,,"stat.ML stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new family of MCMC samplers that combine auxiliary variables,
Gibbs sampling and Taylor expansions of the target density. Our approach
permits the marginalisation over the auxiliary variables yielding marginal
samplers, or the augmentation of the auxiliary variables, yielding auxiliary
samplers. The well-known Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm are shown to be special
cases. We prove that marginal samplers are superior in terms of asymptotic
variance and demonstrate cases where they are slower in computing time compared
to auxiliary samplers. In the context of latent Gaussian models we propose new
auxiliary and marginal samplers whose implementation requires a single tuning
parameter, which can be found automatically during the transient phase.
Extensive experimentation shows that the increase in efficiency (measured as
effective sample size per unit of computing time) relative to (optimised
implementations of) pCNL, elliptical slice sampling and MALA ranges from
10-fold in binary classification problems to 25-fold in log-Gaussian Cox
processes to 100-fold in Gaussian process regression, and it is on par with
Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in an example where the latter has the
same complexity as the aforementioned algorithms. We explain this remarkable
improvement in terms of the way alternative samplers try to approximate the
eigenvalues of the target. We introduce a novel MCMC sampling scheme for
hyperparameter learning that builds upon the auxiliary samplers. The MATLAB

quasi-steady inflow of solids from the outer parts of protoplanetary disks to
their inner regions. Aims: We wish to understand how a significant fraction of
the pebbles grows into planetesimals instead of being lost to the host star.
Methods:We examined analytically how the inward flow of pebbles is affected by
the snow line and under which conditions dust-rich (rocky) planetesimals form.
When calculating the inward drift of solids that is due to gas drag, we
included the back-reaction of the gas to the motion of the solids. Results: We
show that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface
density similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles
does not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by
streaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux
exceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas
ratio. This is particularly important for low-viscosity disks (alpha < 10^(-3))
where we show that inside of the snow line, silicate-dust grains ejected from
sublimating pebbles can accumulate, eventually leading to the formation of
dust-rich planetesimals directly by gravitational instability. Conclusions:
This formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of
time, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au. The
rock-to-ice ratio may thus be globally significantly higher in planetesimals
and planets than in the central star.

representations to improve the search accuracy and use vector quantization
methods to increase the search speed. However, how to learn deep
representations that strongly preserve similarities between data pairs and can
be accurately quantized via vector quantization remains a challenging task.
Existing methods simply leverage quantization loss and similarity loss, which
result in unexpectedly biased back-propagating gradients and affect the search
performances. To this end, we propose a novel gradient snapping layer (GSL) to
directly regularize the back-propagating gradient towards a neighboring
codeword, the generated gradients are un-biased for reducing similarity loss
and also propel the learned representations to be accurately quantized. Joint
deep representation and vector quantization learning can be easily performed by
alternatively optimize the quantization codebook and the deep neural network.
The proposed framework is compatible with various existing vector quantization
approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is
effective, flexible and outperforms the state-of-the-art large scale similarity
search methods.

probability of the radiative recombination with a single ion being shifted from
the twisted electron propagation direction. We also consider more realistic
experimental scenarios where the target is either localized (mesoscopic) or
infinitely wide (macroscopic). The situation when the incident electron is a
coherent superposition of two vortex states is considered as well. For the
nonrelativistic case we present analytical expressions which support our
numerical calculations. We study in details the influence of the electron
twistedness on the polarization and angular distribution of the emitted photon.
It is found that these properties of the outgoing photon might be very
sensitive to the total angular momentum and kinematic properties of twisted
beams. Therefore, the recombination of the twisted electrons can serve as a
valuable tool for atomic investigations as well as for the diagnostics of the

spectral problem. When the state space is finite, the latter consists in
finding an eigenpair $(u,\lambda)$ solution of $T(u)=\lambda e + u$, where
$T:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is the Shapley (or dynamic programming)
operator, $\lambda$ is a scalar, $e$ is the unit vector, and $u \in

the vector $u$, called the bias, allows one to determine optimal stationary
strategies. The existence of the eigenpair $(u,\lambda)$ is generally related
to ergodicity conditions. A basic issue is to understand for which classes of
games the bias vector is unique (up to an additive constant). In this paper, we
consider perfect-information zero-sum stochastic games with finite state and
action spaces, thinking of the transition payments as variable parameters,
transition probabilities being fixed. We show that the bias vector, thought of
as a function of the transition payments, is generically unique (up to an

obtain a perturbation scheme allowing one to solve degenerate instances of

show the existence of a variety of combinatorial structures with good ""local""
properties. The ""LLL-distribution"" can be used to show that the resulting
structures have good global properties in expectation.
  The simplest, variable-based setting of the LLL was covered by the seminal
algorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010). This has since been extended to other
probability spaces including random permutations. One can similarly define an
""MT-distribution"" for these algorithms, that is, the distribution of the
configuration they produce. Haeupler et al. (2011) showed bounds on the
MT-distribution which essentially match the LLL-distribution for the
variable-assignment setting; Harris & Srinivasan showed similar results for the
permutation setting.
  In this work, we show new bounds on the MT-distribution which are
significantly stronger than those known to hold for the LLL-distribution. In
the variable-assignment setting, we show a tighter bound on the probability of
a disjunctive event or singleton event. As a consequence, in $k$-SAT instances
with bounded variable occurrence, the MT-distribution satisfies an
$\epsilon$-approximate independence condition asymptotically stronger than the
LLL-distribution. We use this to show a nearly tight bound on the minimum
implicate size of a CNF boolean formula. Another noteworthy application is
constructing independent transversals which avoid a given subset of vertices;
this provides a constructive analogue to a result of Rabern (2014).
  In the permutation LLL setting, we show a new type of bound which is similar
to the cluster-expansion LLL criterion of Bissacot et al. (2011), but is
stronger and takes advantage of the extra structure in permutations. We
illustrate with improved bounds on weighted Latin transversals and partial
Latin transversals.

constructing a quantization of the beta gamma system with an n-dimensional
formal disk as the target. There is an obstruction to quantizing equivariantly
with respect to the action of formal vector fields on the target disk, and it
is naturally identified with the first Pontryagin class in Gelfand-Fuks
cohomology. Any trivialization of the obstruction cocycle thus yields an
equivariant quantization with respect to an extension of formal vector fields

naturally obtain a factorization algebra of quantum observables, which has an
associated vertex algebra easily identified with the formal beta gamma vertex
algebra. Next, we introduce a version of Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry

is presented in terms of the reality of the wave nature of a particle. In this

a unit and thereby acts as a particle. Only the totality of the entire wave
packet at any instance embodies all the conserved quantities, for example the

acquired all at once during detection. On this basis, many of the bizarre
behaviors observed in the quantum domain, such as wave function collapse, the
limitation of prediction to only a probability rather than a certainty, the
apparent simultaneous existence of a particle in more than one place, and the
inherent uncertainty can be adequately understood. The reality of comprehending
the wave function as an amplitude distribution of irregular disturbances
imposes the necessity of acquiring the wave function in its entirety for
detection. This is evinced by the observed certainty of wave function collapse

field. In order to do this we introduce for the first time the counterterms
that remove the divergences of the action in dilaton gravity for the solutions
with curved boundary. Using the counterterm method, we calculate the conserved
quantities and the action and therefore Gibbs free energy in both the canonical
and grand-canonical ensembles. We treat the cosmological constant as a
thermodynamic pressure, and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume.
In the presence of power-Maxwell field, we find an analogy between the
topological dilaton black holes with van der Walls liquid-gas system in all
dimensions provided the dilaton coupling constant $\alpha$ and the power
parameter $p$ are chosen properly. Interestingly enough, we observe that the
power-Maxwell dilaton black holes admit the phase transition in both canonical
and grand-canonical ensembles. This is in contrast to RN-AdS,
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton and Born-Infeld-dilaton black holes, which only admit
the phase transition in the canonical ensemble. Besides, we calculate the
critical quantities and show that they depend on $\alpha$, $n$ and $p$.
Finally, we obtain the critical exponents in two ensembles and show that they
