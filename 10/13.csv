natural mechanism for terminating inflation so reheating and the hot big bang
cosmology starts from the evaporation of black hole to relativistic particles.
The quantum gravitational fluctuations at the boundary of black hole generate
the nearly scale invariant scalar and tensor perturbations with the ratio of
tensor to scalar power spectra at the order of $10^{-3}$. As the black hole
evaporates, the radius of its event horizon shrinks and the Hubble expansion
rate during inflation increases slowly so the quantum Hawking radiation

limit, we perform Bayesian model selection between three source models (point,
elliptical Gaussian, and circular Gaussian). Our modelling jointly accounts for
antenna-dependent gains and system equivalent flux densities. We obtain
posterior distributions for the various source and instrumental parameters
along with the corresponding uncertainties and correlations between them. We
find that there is very strong evidence (>1e9 :1) in favour of elliptical
Gaussian structure and using this model derive the apparent brightness
temperature distribution of the blazar, accounting for uncertainties in the
shape estimates. To test the integrity of our method, we also perform model
selection on synthetic observations and use this to develop a Bayesian
criterion for the minimum resolvable source size and consequently the maximum
measurable brightness temperature for a given interferometer, dependent on the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data incorporating the aforementioned
systematics. We find that calibration errors play an increasingly important

  (JMLR)",,,,"stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work characterizes the benefits of averaging schemes widely used in
conjunction with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, this work
provides a sharp analysis of: (1) mini-batching, a method of averaging many
samples of a stochastic gradient to both reduce the variance of the stochastic
gradient estimate and for parallelizing SGD and (2) tail-averaging, a method
involving averaging the final few iterates of SGD to decrease the variance in
SGD's final iterate. This work presents non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for
these schemes for the stochastic approximation problem of least squares
regression.
  Furthermore, this work establishes a precise problem-dependent extent to
which mini-batch SGD yields provable near-linear parallelization speedups over
SGD with batch size one. This allows for understanding learning rate versus
batch size tradeoffs for the final iterate of an SGD method. These results are
then utilized in providing a highly parallelizable SGD method that obtains the
minimax risk with nearly the same number of serial updates as batch gradient
descent, improving significantly over existing SGD methods. A non-asymptotic
analysis of communication efficient parallelization schemes such as
model-averaging/parameter mixing methods is then provided.
  Finally, this work sheds light on some fundamental differences in SGD's
behavior when dealing with agnostic noise in the (non-realizable) least squares
regression problem. In particular, the work shows that the stepsizes that
ensure minimax risk for the agnostic case must be a function of the noise
properties.
  This paper builds on the operator view of analyzing SGD methods, introduced
by Defossez and Bach (2015), followed by developing a novel analysis in
bounding these operators to characterize the excess risk. These techniques are
of broader interest in analyzing computational aspects of stochastic
approximation.

dimension dependences of the optical parameters of the nanometer-scale layers
of materials. It is shown that both an index of refraction and coefficient of
absorption depend strongly on the thickness of the layer. In this region of
thicknesses, the dimension resonance occurs, where an index of refraction has a
maximum and a coefficient of absorption has a minimum. The numerical
calculation of the optical parameters of some materials (Ag, Al, Fe, Ge, Si,
Se, Te) have been carried out with the use of the experimental data of
reflection and transparency of thin layers, obtained in a series of works, and
with our formulas for the wave amplitudes and the laws of refractions. The
analogues of the Fresnel formulas and the Snell law have been derived from the
Maxwell boundary conditions where the absorption and conductivity of media were
taken into account. The use of our formulas for the wave amplitudes leads to
the fulfillment of the conservation law of energy both for the TE- and TM-
polarizations of light. The reemission of light is possible for the
thicknesses, which is equal to the wavelength of light in a medium, divisible
by integer:
$\frac{2{\pi}d_{res}}{2}={\lambda}_m{\cdot}m=\frac{{\lambda}_0}{n}{\cdot}m$,

whiskers and other nanometer-scale structures can be explained by their
emission in the case of dimension resonance because in this region of
thicknesses, layers have a big negative coefficient of absorption and little -
of a damping. It is also shown that in the case of the TM-polarization, in a
material with a high conductivity, light refracts in a ""wrong"" direction (at
all positive optical parameters) due to a surface current. In the case of the
TE-polarization, light refracts only in a ""right"" direction.

probabilities of deviation of a sample sum from its expectation, when the
variables involved in the summation are obtained by sampling in a finite
population according to a rejective scheme, generalizing sampling without
replacement, and by using an appropriate normalization. In contrast to Poisson
sampling, classical deviation inequalities in the i.i.d. setting do not
straightforwardly apply to sample sums related to rejective schemes, due to the
inherent dependence structure of the sampled points. We show here how to
overcome this difficulty, by combining the formulation of rejective sampling as
Poisson sampling conditioned upon the sample size with the Escher
transformation. In particular, the Bennett/Bernstein type bounds established
highlight the effect of the asymptotic variance of the (properly standardized)
sample weighted sum and are shown to be much more accurate than those based on
the negative association property shared by the terms involved in the
summation. Beyond its interest in itself, such a result for rejective sampling
is crucial, insofar as it can be extended to many other sampling schemes,
namely those that can be accurately approximated by rejective plans in the
sense of the total variation distance.

describing feeding relationships between consumers and producers in an
ecosystem. They have application across scales where they differ only in the
underlying characteristics of the organisms and substrates describing the
system. Mathematical modelling, using mechanistic approaches to describe the
dynamic behaviour and properties of the system through sets of ordinary
differential equations, has been used extensively in ecology. Models allow
simulation of the dynamics of the various motifs and their numerical analysis
provides a greater understanding of the interplay between the system components
and their intrinsic properties. We have developed the MI-Sim software for use
with MATLAB to allow a rigorous and rapid numerical analysis of several common
ecological motifs. MI-Sim contains a series of the most commonly used motifs
such as cooperation, competition and predation. It does not require detailed
knowledge of mathematical analytical techniques and is offered as a single
graphical user interface containing all input and output options. The tools
available in the current version of MI-Sim include model simulation, steady-
state existence and stability analysis, and basin of attraction analysis. The
software includes seven ecological interaction motifs and seven growth function
models. Unlike other system analysis tools, MI-Sim is designed as a simple and
user-friendly tool specific to ecological population type models, allowing for
rapid assessment of their dynamical and behavioural properties.

of P to a positive real number. We examine the problem of computing the exact
mean and variance of M when a subset of points in P is selected according to a
well-defined random distribution. We consider two distributions; in the first
distribution (which we call the Bernoulli distribution), each point p in P is
included in the random subset independently, with probability pi(p). In the
second distribution (the fixed-size distribution), a subset of exactly s points
is selected uniformly at random among all possible subsets of s points in P.
  This problem is a crucial part of modern ecological analyses; each point in P
represents a species in d-dimensional trait space, and the goal is to compute
the statistics of a geometric measure on this trait space, when subsets of
species are selected under random processes.
  We present efficient exact algorithms for computing the mean and variance of
several geometric measures when point sets are selected under one of the
described random distributions. More specifically, we provide algorithms for
the following measures: the bounding box volume, the convex hull volume, the
mean pairwise distance (MPD), the squared Euclidean distance from the centroid,
and the diameter of the minimum enclosing disk. We also describe an efficient
(1-e)-approximation algorithm for computing the mean and variance of the mean
pairwise distance. We implemented three of our algorithms and we show that our
implementations can provide major speedups compared to the existing imprecise

suprathermal electrons can propagate through the steep temperature gradient of
the transition region towards the chromosphere, and lead to non-Maxwellian
electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with pronounced suprathermal
tails. We calculate the evolution of a coronal electron distribution through
the transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population
there. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the
Boltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both
ions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are
Maxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid
model. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of
suprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the
presence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs,
starting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV,
electrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free. The
presence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs shows
that the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not justified there.
This has a significant impact on ionization dynamics, as is shown in a

average value for the observable being measured allows for improved phase
sensitivity. However, additional phase sensitivity can be achieved using phase
estimation strategies that account for the full distribution of measurement

a parametric downconversion photon source. The Fisher information for all

heralds its entangled counterpart in a pure quantum state with a temporal shape
non-locally affected by the modulation. We found conditions for the shape of
the heralded photon to reproduce the modulation function. The method can be
implemented with various sources of time-energy entangled photons. In
particular, using entangled photons from the parametric down-conversion the
method enables generation of pure photons with tunable shape within

achieve perfect zero knowledge (PZK) for languages beyond NP, under no
intractability assumptions:
  1. The complexity class #P has PZK proofs in the model of Interactive PCPs
(IPCPs) [KR08], where the verifier first receives from the prover a PCP and
then engages with the prover in an Interactive Proof (IP).
  2. The complexity class NEXP has PZK proofs in the model of Interactive
Oracle Proofs (IOPs) [BCS16,RRR16], where the verifier, in every round of
interaction, receives a PCP from the prover.
  Our constructions rely on succinct simulators that enable us to ""simulate
beyond NP"", achieving exponential savings in efficiency over [BCGV16]. These
simulators crucially rely on solving a problem that lies at the intersection of
coding theory, linear algebra, and computational complexity, which we call the
succinct constraint detection problem, and consists of detecting dual
constraints with polynomial support size for codes of exponential block length.
Our two results rely on solutions to this problem for fundamental classes of
linear codes:
  * An algorithm to detect constraints for Reed--Muller codes of exponential
length.
  * An algorithm to detect constraints for PCPs of Proximity of Reed--Solomon
codes [BS08] of exponential degree.
  The first algorithm exploits the Raz--Shpilka [RS05] deterministic polynomial
identity testing algorithm, and shows, to our knowledge, a first connection of
algebraic complexity theory with zero knowledge. Along the way, we give a
perfect zero knowledge analogue of the celebrated sumcheck protocol [LFKN92],
by leveraging both succinct constraint detection and low-degree testing. The
second algorithm exploits the recursive structure of the PCPs of Proximity to
show that small-support constraints are ""locally"" spanned by a small number of

oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars as a function of their luminosity, surface
chemical composition, and initial metallicity. The new prescription is based on
results of detailed spectral analyses of WC and WO stars, and improves the
often applied Nugis & Lamers (2000) relation. We find that the mass-loss rates
of WC and WO stars (with $X=0$ and $Y < 0.98$) can be expressed as
$\log{\dot{M}} = -9.20 + 0.85\log{(L/L_{\odot})} + 0.44\log{Y} +
0.25\log{(Z_{\mathrm{Fe}}/Z_{\mathrm{Fe}, \odot})}$. This relation is based on
mass-loss determinations that assume a volume-filling factor of 0.1, but the
prescription can easily be scaled to account for other volume-filling factors.
The residual of the fit is $\sigma = 0.06$ dex. We investigated whether the
relation can also describe the mass loss of hydrogen-free WN stars and showed
that it can when an adjustement of the metallicty dependence ($\log{\dot{M}}
\propto 1.3\log{(Z_{\mathrm{Fe}}/Z_{\mathrm{Fe}, \odot})}$) is applied.
Compared to Nugis & Lamers (2000), $\dot{M}$ is less sensitive to the
luminosity and the surface abundance, implying a stronger mass loss of massive
stars in their late stages of evolution. The modest metallicity dependence
implies that if WC or WO stars are formed in metal deficient environments,
their mass-loss rates are higher than currently anticipated. These effects may
result in a larger number of type Ic supernovae and less black holes to be
formed, and may favour the production of superluminous type Ic supernovae
through interaction with C and O rich circumstellar material or the dense
stellar wind.

Relativity. The initial value problem then consists of specifying initial data
for all relevant fields on one such a spatial hypersurface. These fields are
the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature together with matter fields such as fluid
velocity, energy density and rest mass density. There is a lot of freedom in
choosing such initial data. This freedom corresponds to the physical state of
the system at the initial time. At the same time the initial data have to
satisfy the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations of General Relativity
and can thus not be chosen completely freely. We discuss the conformal
transverse traceless and conformal thin sandwich decompositions that are
commonly used in the construction of constraint satisfying initial data. These
decompositions allow us to specify certain free data that describe the physical
nature of the system. The remaining metric fields are then determined by
solving elliptic equations derived from the constraint equations. We describe
initial data for single black holes and single neutron stars, and how we can
use conformal decompositions to construct initial data for binaries made up of
black holes or neutron stars. Orbiting binaries will emit gravitational
radiation and thus lose energy. Since the emitted radiation tends to
circularize the orbits over time, one can thus expect that the objects in a
typical binary move on almost circular orbits with slowly shrinking radii. This
leads us to the concept of quasi-equilibrium which essentially assumes that
time derivatives are negligible in corotating coordinates, for binaries on
almost circular orbits. We review how quasi-equilibrium assumptions can be used
to make physically well motivated approximations that simplify the elliptic
equations we have to solve.

non-increasing decomposition into Lyndon words. This article extends this
factorization theorem, obtaining the proportion of these decompositions that

analytically that the fourth and sixth order energy cumulants vanish in the

Gaussian spectral density. However, for finite $N$, the tail of the average
spectral density is well approximated by a semi-circle law. The specific heat
coefficient, determined numerically from the low temperature behavior of the
partition function, is consistent with the value obtained by previous
analytical calculations. For energy scales of the order of the mean level
spacing we show that level statistics are well described by random matrix
theory. Due to the underlying Clifford algebra of the model, the universality
class of the spectral correlations depends on $N$. For larger energy
separations we identify an energy scale that grows with $N$, reminiscent of the
Thouless energy in mesoscopic physics, where deviations from random matrix
theory are observed. Our results are a further confirmation that the

involving separately the particle's shape-dependent bulk mobility and the

particle orientation and the characteristic frequencies associated with
shearing and bending of the membrane. This makes the equations applicable to an
arbitrary-shaped axisymmetric particle provided that its bulk mobilities are
known, either analytically or numerically. For a spheroidal particle, these
general relations reduce to simple expressions in terms of the particle's

mobility are primarily determined by bending, whereas shearing manifests itself
in a more pronounced way in the rotational mobility. We demonstrate the

mass-fraction, but all galaxies simulated at our highest resolution regrow a
significant disk by z=0 (with a disk fraction larger than 24%). For runs with
our default physics model, which includes galactic winds from star formation

HBC 515, a system consisting of multiple young stellar objects (YSOs). The five
members of HBC 515 represent a remarkably diverse array of YSOs, ranging from
the low-mass Class I/II protostar HBC 515B, through Class II and transition
disk objects (HBC 515D and C, respectively), to the ""diskless"", intermediate-
mass, pre-main sequence binary HBC 515A. Our Chandra/ACIS imaging establishes
that all five components are X-ray sources, with HBC 515A - a
subarcsecond-separation binary that is partially resolved by Chandra - being
the dominant X-ray source. We detect an X-ray flare associated with HBC 515B.
In the SMA imaging, HBC 515B is detected as a strong 1.3 mm continuum emission
source; a second, weaker mm continuum source is coincident with the position of
the transition disk object HBC 515C. These results strongly support the
protostellar nature of HBC 515B, and firmly establish HBC 515A as a member of
the rare class of relatively massive, X-ray luminous ""weak-lined T Tauri stars""

evolution. The coexistence of two such disparate objects within a single,

tight correlation between various elemental abundances and age, in particular
[Y/Mg]. If this relation is real and valid for other types of stars as well as
elsewhere in the Galaxy it would provide a very powerful tool to derive ages of
stars without the need to resort to determining their masses (evolutionary
stage) very precisely. The method would also likely work if the stellar
parameters have relatively large errors. The studies presented in the recent
literature span a narrow range of [Fe/H]. By studying a larger sample of Solar
neighbourhood dwarfs with a much larger range in [Fe/H], we find that the
relation between [Y/Mg] and age depends on the [Fe/H] of the stars. Hence, it
appears that the [Y/Mg] - age relation is unique to Solar analogues.

[Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity,
and IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent
spectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the
first time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of
massive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range
0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations
cannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices,
strengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations
of theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as
upper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to 0.8Re, the
radial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to
0.5Re, and decreasing by 0.2-0.3dex at 0.8Re, without any clear correlation
with local metallicity. Such a result seems to be in contrast with the
predicted increase of Na nucleosynthetic yields from AGB stars and TypeII SNe.
For XSG1, the Na-inferred IMF radial profile is consistent, within the errors,
with that derived from TiO features and the Wing-Ford band, presented in a

observer's viewing angles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the
peak luminosity function (LF) and event rate density of these X-ray transients.
By considering that a fraction of massive neutron stars may be supra-massive
and later collapse into black holes after spinning down, we investigate how the
predicted LF depends on the equation of state (EoS) of the central object and
the geometry of the system. In general, the LF can be fit by two log-normal
distributions peaking around $10^{46.4}$ and $10^{49.6}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$,
corresponding to the trapped and free zones, respectively. For the majority of
the EoS models, the current non-detection is consistent with having a free zone
solid angle at most a few times of the solid angle of the short GRB jet. The
event rate density of these X-ray transients is around a few tens of $\rm
Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for luminosity above $10^{45}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. We predict
that future X-ray telescopes (such as Einstein Probe) with sensitivity $\sim

makes XMMSL1 J0740$-$85 at $d=75$ Mpc the nearest TDE with detected radio

observed radio luminosity rules out a powerful relativistic jet like that seen
in the relativistic TDE Swift J1644+57. Instead we infer from an equipartition
analysis that the radio emission most likely arises from a non-relativistic
outflow similar to that seen in the nearby TDE ASASSN-14li, with a velocity of
about $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ and a kinetic energy of about $10^{48}$ erg, expanding
into a medium with a density of about $10^2$ cm$^{-3}$. Alternatively, the
radio emission could arise from a weak initially-relativistic but decelerated
jet with an energy of $\sim 2\times 10^{50}$ erg, or (for an extreme disruption
geometry) from the unbound debris. The radio data for XMMSL1 J0740$-$85
continues to support the previous suggestion of a bimodal distribution of
common non-relativistic isotropic outflows and rare relativistic jets in TDEs
(in analogy with the relation between Type Ib/c supernovae and long-duration

low-amplitude dipole modes, which are referred to as depressed modes. Recently,
these low amplitudes have been attributed to the presence of a strong magnetic
field in the stellar core of those stars.
  We intend to study the properties of depressed modes in evolved stars, which
is a necessary condition before concluding on the physical nature of the
mechanism responsible for the reduction of the dipole mode amplitudes.
  We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of
depressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The
observation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is
especially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode
damping.
  Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure
pressure modes but mixed modes. This result invalidates the hypothesis that the
depressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the
radiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for the
visibility, the seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are
equivalent to those of normal stars.
  The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed
global seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism
responsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is
able to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it.
Moreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component
of the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic field proposed
for explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and
cannot be used to infer the strength and the prevalence of high magnetic fields
in red giants.

This is well
assessed by observations in the local Universe. However the efficiency of this

forming, galaxies. We present a suite of pc-resolution hydrodynamical numerical
simulations to compare the star formation process along a merging sequence of
high and low z galaxies, by varying the gas mass fraction between the two
models. We show that, for the same orbit, high-redshift gas-rich mergers are
less efficient than low-redshift ones at producing starbursts: the star
formation rate excess induced by the merger and its duration are both around 10
times lower than in the low gas fraction case. The mechanisms that account for
the star formation triggering at low redshift - the increased compressive
turbulence, gas fragmentation, and central gas inflows - are only mildly, if
not at all, enhanced for high gas fraction galaxy encounters. Furthermore, we
show that the strong stellar feedback from the initially high star formation
rate in high redshift galaxies does not prevent an increase of the star
formation during the merger. Our results are consistent with the observed
increase of the number of major mergers with increasing redshift being faster
than the respective increase in the number of starburst galaxies.

trend of increasing fractional dayside-nightside brightness temperature
difference with increasing incident stellar flux, both averaged across the
infrared and in each individual wavelength band. The analytic theory of Komacek
& Showman (2016) shows that this trend is due to the decreasing ability with
increasing incident stellar flux of waves to propagate from day to night and
erase temperature differences. Here, we compare the predictions of this theory
to observations, showing that it explains well the shape of the trend of
increasing dayside-nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium
temperature. Applied to individual planets, the theory matches well with
observations at high equilibrium temperatures but, for a fixed photosphere
pressure of $100 \ \mathrm{mbar}$, systematically under-predicts the
dayside-nightside brightness temperature differences at equilibrium
temperatures less than $2000 \ \mathrm{K}$. We interpret this as due to as the
effects of a process that moves the infrared photospheres of these cooler hot
Jupiters to lower pressures. We also utilize general circulation modeling with
double-grey radiative transfer to explore how the circulation changes with
equilibrium temperature and drag strengths. As expected from our theory, the
dayside-nightside temperature differences from our numerical simulations
increase with increasing incident stellar flux and drag strengths. We calculate
model phase curves using our general circulation models, from which we compare
the broadband infrared offset from the substellar point and dayside-nightside

of the fastest algorithm for the \emph{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem in
the \emph{Congested Clique} model was first improved to $O(\log \log \log n)$
from $O(\log \log n)$ (Hegeman et al., PODC 2015) and then to $O(\log^* n)$
(Ghaffari and Parter, PODC 2016). All of these algorithms use $\Theta(n^2)$
messages independent of the number of edges in the input graph.
  This paper positively answers a question raised in Hegeman et al., and
presents the first ""super-fast"" MST algorithm with $o(m)$ message complexity
for input graphs with $m$ edges. Specifically, we present an algorithm running
in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds, with message complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m \cdot n})$
and then build on this algorithm to derive a family of algorithms, containing
for any $\varepsilon$, $0 < \varepsilon \le 1$, an algorithm running in
$O(\log^* n/\varepsilon)$ rounds, using $\tilde{O}(n^{1 +
\varepsilon}/\varepsilon)$ messages. Setting $\varepsilon = \log\log n/\log n$
leads to the first sub-logarithmic round Congested Clique MST algorithm that
uses only $\tilde{O}(n)$ messages.
  Our primary tools in achieving these results are (i) a component-wise bound
on the number of candidates for MST edges, extending the sampling lemma of
Karger, Klein, and Tarjan (Karger, Klein, and Tarjan, JACM 1995) and (ii)

photocurrents are compared for five different excitation wavelengths, ranging
from nm to nm. The photocurrent excited with incident p-polarized light (the
case for resonant surface plasmon excitation) is significantly amplified in
comparison with that for s-polarized light (without surface plasmon

current resulting from higher damping of surface plasmons at shorter wavelength
excitation. Position-dependent Raman spectroscopic analysis of the
optically-excited graphene photodetector indicates the presence of charge
carriers near the metallic edge. In addition, we show that the polarity of
photocurrent switches across the gap as the incident light spot moves across
the gap. Graphene-based photodetectors offer a simple architecture which can be
fabricated on dielectric waveguides to exploit the plasmonic photocurrent
enhancement of the evanescent field for detection. Applications for these

dislocation nucleation sites are found to concentrate in low latitude region
near the equator of the spherical void surfaces. We propose a continuum wave
reflection theory and a resolved shear stress model to explain the distribution
of dislocation nucleation sites. The simulations reveals two mechanisms of void
collapse: the plasticity mechanism and the internal jetting mechanism. The
plasticity mechanism, which leads to transverse collapse of voids, prevails
under relatively weaker shocks; while the internal jetting mechanism, which
leads to longitudinal filling of the void vacuum, plays more significant role
as the shock intensity increases. In addition, an abnormal thermodynamic
phenomenon (i.e., arising of temperature with pressure dropping) in shocked
np-Al is discovered. This phenomenon is incompatible with the conventional
Rankine-Hugoniot theory, and is explained by the nonequilibrium processes
involved in void collapse. The influences of void collapse on spall fracture of
np-Al is studied. Under the same loading velocity, the spall strength of np-Al
is found to be lower than that of single-crystal Al; but the spall resistance
is higher in np-Al than in single-crystal Al. This is explained by the combined
influences of thermal dissipation and stress attenuation during shock wave
propagation in np-Al.

techniques that enable one to quantify the benefits and tradeoffs of MTDs. In
this paper, a novel approach for implementing MTD techniques that can be used
to randomize cryptographic techniques and keys in wireless networks is
proposed. In particular, the problem is formulated as a stochastic game in
which a base station (BS), acting as a defender seeks to strategically change
its cryptographic techniques and keys in an effort to deter an attacker that is
trying to eavesdrop on the data. The game is shown to exhibit a
single-controller property in which only one player, the defender, controls the
state of the game. For this game, the existence and properties of the Nash
equilibrium are studied, in the presence of a defense cost for using MTD. Then,
a practical algorithm for deriving the equilibrium MTD strategies is derived.
Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic MTD framework can
significantly improve the overall utility of the defender, while enabling
effective randomization over cryptographic techniques.

transitional disk around the young solar-like star GM Aur. The near-infrared
direct imaging of the disk was derived by polarimetric differential imaging
using the Subaru 8.2-m Telescope and HiCIAO. An angular resolution and an inner
working angle of 0.""07 and r~0.""05, respectively, were obtained. We clearly
resolved a large inner cavity, with a measured radius of 18+/-2 au, which is
smaller than that of a submillimeter interferometric image (28 au). This
discrepancy in the cavity radii at near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths
may be caused by a 3-4M_Jup planet about 20 au away from the star, near the
edge of the cavity. The presence of a near-infrared inner is a strong
constraint on hypotheses for inner cavity formation in a transitional disk. A
dust filtration mechanism has been proposed to explain the large cavity in the
submillimeter image, but our results suggest that this mechanism must be
combined with an additional process. We found that the PI slope of the outer
disk is significantly different from the intensity slope obtained from
HST/NICMOS, and this difference may indicate the grain growth process in the
disk.

morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-15% of the population in a typical
epidemic season. Human influenza epidemics are caused by types A and B, with
roughly 25% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded
RNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and
vaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high
rate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual
influenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To
predict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected
vaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here
introduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B
vaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with
effectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans
between 1979 and 2014. We discuss how this measure of antigenic distance may be
used in the context of annual influenza vaccine design and prediction of

crystals, quasicrystals, and some exotic disordered systems, are characterized
by an anomalous suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales such
that the local number variance within a ""spherical"" observation window grows
slower than the window volume. In usual circumstances, this direct space
condition is equivalent to the Fourier space hyperuniformity condition that the
structure factor vanishes as the wavenumber goes to zero. In this paper, we
comprehensively study the effect of aspherical window shapes with
characteristic size $L$ on the direct space condition for hyperuniform systems.
For lattices, we demonstrate that the variance growth rate can depend on the
shape as well as the orientation of the windows, and in some cases, the growth
rate can be faster than the window volume ($L^d$), which may lead one to
falsely conclude that the system is non-hyperuniform solely according to the
direct space condition. We analyze the effect of window orientation on the
growth rate, especially for two-dimensional lattices using square windows.
Based on this analysis, we explain the reason why the variance can grow faster
than the window area ($L^2$) or even slower than the window perimeter ($L$).
This analysis demonstrates an example of physical systems exhibiting
commensurate-incommensurate transitions and is closely related to problems in
number theory (e.g., Diophantine approximation and Gauss' circle problem) and
discrepancy theory. We prove that for a hyperuniform system its
orientationally-averaged variance, instead of the conventional one using
windows with a fixed orientation, has a common large-$L$ asymptotic behavior
regardless of the window shape (for convex windows), thus it can be used to
resolve the window-shape dependence of the growth rate of the variance on the
spherical-window condition.

emission lines are detected for the first time, both in the obscured and
unobscured portion of the optical narrow line region (NLR), allowing us to
assess the combined effects of the central continuum source, outflowing gas and
shocks generated by the radio jet on the central 280 pc gas. The HI and [FeII]
lines allow us to map the extinction affecting the NLR. We found that the
nuclear region is heavily obscured, with E(B-V) ~1.9 mag. To the NE of the
nucleus and up to ~150 pc, the extinction remains large, ~1 mag or larger,
consistent with the system of dust lanes seen in optical imaging. We derived
position-velocity diagrams for the most prominent lines as well as for the
stellar component. Only the molecular gas and the stellar component display a
well-organized pattern consistent with disk rotation. Other emission lines are
kinematically perturbed or show little evidence of rotation. Extended
high-ionization emission of sulfur, silicon and calcium is observed to
distances of at least 200 pc both NE and SW of the nucleus. We compared flux
ratios between these lines with photoionization models and conclude that
radiation from the central source alone cannot explain the observed
high-ionization spectrum. Shocks between the radio-jet and the ambient gas are
very likely an additional source of excitation. We conclude that NGC 4388 is a
prime laboratory to study the interplay between all these mechanisms.

calls lead males to a greater reproductive success than simple calls do.
However, the complex calls are also more attractive to the main predator of
these amphibians, the bat Trachops cirrhosus. Therefore, as M. Ryan suggests,
the complexity of the calls let the frogs keep a trade off between reproductive
success and predation. In this paper, we first propose to model the proportion
of simple to complex calls as a symmetric game of two strategies. We also
propose a model with three strategies (simple callers, complex callers and
quiet males), where we assess the effect of a male that keeps quiet and
intercepts females, which would play a role of Intrasexual selection. We
analyze the stable points of the replicator equations of the models that we
propose. Under the assumption that the decision of the males takes into account
this trade off between reproductive success and predation, our model reproduces
the observed behavior reported in the literature with minimal assumption on the
parameters. From the three strategies model, we verify that the quiet strategy
could only coexists with the simple and complex strategies as long as the rate
at which quiet males intercept females is high. We conclude that the
reproductive strategy of the male frog Engystomops pustulosus is rational.

the need for a parameterization of the surface itself. Surface quantities are
embedded into the surrounding domain by assigning each value at a given spatial
location to the corresponding value at the closest point on the surface. This
embedding allows for surface derivatives to be replaced by their Cartesian
counterparts (e.g. $\nabla_s = \nabla$). This equivalence is only valid on the
surface, and thus, interpolation is used to enforce what is known as the side
condition away from the surface. To improve upon the method, this work derives
an operator embedding that incorporates curvature information, making it valid
in a neighborhood of the surface. With this, direct enforcement of the side
condition is no longer needed. Comparisons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$
show that the resulting Curvature-Augmented Closest Point method has better
accuracy and requires less memory, through increased matrix sparsity, than the
Closest Point method, while maintaining similar matrix condition numbers. To
demonstrate the utility of the method in a physical application, simulations of
inextensible, bi-lipid vesicles evolving toward equilibrium shapes are also
included.

that conditional independence reasoning can also be applied to optimize
epistemic model checking, in which one verifies that a model for a number of

networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous
work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between
banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge
probabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We
analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the
cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge
probabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition
that characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can
grow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number
$R_0$ in epidemic modelling. The cascade condition provides an easily computed
measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.
Using the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic
formula for the frequency of global cascades. Although the analytical methods
are derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations
the applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. We show that
edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can
have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade
condition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and
we propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the
graph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.

semiconvection) is a form of linear double-diffusive instability that occurs in
fluids that are unstably stratified in temperature (Schwarzschild unstable),
but stably stratified in chemical composition (Ledoux stable). This scenario is
thought to be quite common in the interiors of stars and giant planets, and
understanding the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC is of great
importance to stellar and planetary evolution models. Fluids unstable to ODDC
have a tendency to form convective thermo-compositional layers which
significantly enhance the fluxes of temperature and chemical composition
compared with microscopic diffusion. Although a number of recent studies have
focused on studying properties of both layered and non-layered ODDC, few have
addressed how additional physical processes such as global rotation affect its
dynamics. In this work we study first how rotation affects the linear stability
properties of rotating ODDC. Using direct numerical simulations we then analyze
the effect of rotation on properties of layered and non-layered ODDC, and study
how the angle of the rotation axis with respect to the direction of gravity
affects layering. We find that rotating systems can be broadly grouped into two
categories, based on the strength of rotation. Qualitative behavior in the more
weakly rotating group is similar to non-rotating ODDC, but strongly rotating
systems become dominated by vortices that are invariant in the direction of the
rotation vector and strongly influence transport. We find that whenever layers
form, rotation always acts to reduce thermal and compositional transport.

  Assessing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Excitonic effects in solids can be calculated using the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (BSE) or the Casida equation of time-dependent density-functional
theory (TDDFT). In both methods, the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), which
decouples excitations and de-excitations, is widely used to reduce
computational cost. Here, we study the effect of the TDA on exciton binding
energies of solids obtained from the Casida equation using long-range corrected
(LRC) exchange-correlation kernels. We find that the TDA underestimates
TDDFT-LRC exciton binding energies of semiconductors slightly, but those of
insulators significantly (i.e., by more than 100%), and thus it is essential to
solve the full Casida equation to describe strongly bound excitons. These
findings are relevant in the ongoing search for accurate and efficient TDDFT
approaches for excitons.

Rossby number. At positive differential rotation there is a regime of
quasigeostrophic flow, with low levels of fluctuations near the outer sphere.
Negative differential rotation shows a regime of what appear to be saturated
hydrodynamic instabilities at low negative differential rotation, followed by a
regime where filamentary structures develop at low latitudes and persist over
five to ten differential rotation periods as they drift poleward. We emphasize
that all these coherent structures emerge from turbulent flows. At least some

method and quasi-static approximation, we theoretically analyze the band
structures stemming from near-field interaction of localized surface plasmon
polaritons for both the infinite lattice and ribbons. Naturally, the
interaction of point dipoles decouples into independent out-of-plane and
in-plane polarizations. For the out-of-plane modes, both the bulk spectrum and
the range of the momentum $k_{\parallel}$ where edge states exist in ribbons
are similar to the electronic bands in graphene. Nevertheless, the in-plane
polarized modes show significant differences, which do not only possess
additional non-flat edge states in ribbons, but also have different
distributions of the flat edge states in reciprocal space. For in-plane
polarized modes, we derived the bulk-edge correspondence, namely, the relation
between the number of flat edge states at a fixed $k_\parallel$, Zak phases of
the bulk bands and the winding number associated with the bulk hamiltonian, and
verified it through four typical ribbon boundaries, i.e. zigzag, bearded

Therefore, for higher concentration it is a good system to proof how the change

the heat capacity we found the expected isotopic effect. However, the anomalous
isotopic effect observed for the heat release data cannot be explained within

equations with discontinuities --- can accomodate real-world non-idealities
through perturbations by hysteresis, time-delay, discretization, and noise.
These are used to model the processes associated with switching in electronic
control, mechanical contact, predator-prey preferences, and genetic or cellular
regulation. The effect of such perturbations on rapid switching dynamics about
a single switch are somewhat benign: in the limit that the size of the
perturbation goes to zero the dynamics is given by Filippov's sliding solution.
When multiple switches are involved, however, perturbations can have
complicated effects, as shown in this paper. In the zero-perturbation limit,

decreases till it attains a minimum value of zero at a critical pressure, after
which it increases again. The critical pressure corresponding to the closure of
the band gap is calculated, at which BiTeI becomes a topological insulator.
Comparison of the critical pressure to the pressure at which BiTeI undergoes a
structural phase transition indicates that the closure of the band gap would
not be hindered by a structural transformation. Moreover, the band-gap pressure
coefficients of BiTeI are computed, and an expression of the critical pressure
is devised in terms of these coefficients. Our findings indicate that the

Subsequently, we analyze the Jacobi linearization of the system evaluated at
the equilibria in order to show that the equilibria are asymptotically stable
relative to certain affine subspaces. As this approach does not require any
monotonicity features of the system, it may also be applied for more complex
systems of the same kind such as bi-directional ribosome flows or time-varying

Factorization (NMF) with high dimensional data in a spectral conversion (SC)

applications such as personalized speech synthesis and speech enhancement.
Exemplar-based NMF (ENMF) emerges as an effective and probably the simplest
choice among all techniques for SC, as long as a source-target parallel speech
corpus is given. ENMF-based SC systems usually need a large amount of bases
(exemplars) to ensure the quality of the converted speech. However, a small and
effective dictionary is desirable but hard to obtain via dictionary update, in
particular when high-dimensional features such as STRAIGHT spectra are used.
Therefore, we propose a dictionary update framework for NMF by means of an
encoder-decoder reformulation. Regarding NMF as an encoder-decoder network
makes it possible to exploit the whole parallel corpus more effectively and
efficiently when applied to SC. Our experiments demonstrate significant gains
of the proposed system with small dictionaries over conventional ENMF-based
systems with dictionaries of same or much larger size.

networks, technical applications, or business applications. Companies try to
commercialize these data using data mining or machine learning methods. For
this purpose, the data are categorized or classified, but often at high
(monetary or temporal) costs. An effective approach to reduce these costs is to
apply any kind of active learning (AL) methods, as AL controls the training
process of a classifier by specific querying individual data points (samples),
which are then labeled (e.g., provided with class memberships) by a domain
expert. However, an analysis of current AL research shows that AL still has
some shortcomings. In particular, the structure information given by the
spatial pattern of the (un)labeled data in the input space of a classification
model (e.g.,~cluster information), is used in an insufficient way. In addition,
many existing AL techniques pay too little attention to their practical
applicability. To meet these challenges, this article presents several
techniques that together build a new approach for combining AL and
semi-supervised learning (SSL) for support vector machines (SVM) in
classification tasks. Structure information is captured by means of
probabilistic models that are iteratively improved at runtime when label
information becomes available. The probabilistic models are considered in a
selection strategy based on distance, density, diversity, and distribution (4DS
strategy) information for AL and in a kernel function (Responsibility Weighted
Mahalanobis kernel) for SVM. The approach fuses generative and discriminative
modeling techniques. With 20 benchmark data sets and with the MNIST data set it
is shown that our new solution yields significantly better results than
state-of-the-art methods.

case the MEF is always trivial, although $(G\times H)/\mathcal{L}$ continues to
be the Kronecker factor for the Mirsky measure. As this situation occurs for
many interesting examples like the square-free numbers or the visible lattice
points, there is some need for a slightly weaker concept of topological factors
that is still strong enough to capture basic properties of the system. Here we
propose to use the concept of a generic factor \cite{HuangYe2012} for this
purpose. For so called ergodic topological dynamical systems we prove the
existence of a maximal equicontinuous generic factor (MEGF) and characterize it
in terms of the regional proximal relation. For such systems we also show that
the MEGF is trivial if and only if the system is topologically weakly mixing.
This part of the paper profits strongly from previous work by McMahon
\cite{McMahon1978} and Auslander \cite{Auslander1988}. In Section 3 we show
that $(G\times H)/\mathcal{L}$ is indeed the MEGF of the orbit closure of each
weak model set with an aperiodic Haar regulaar window, and in Section 4 we
apply this fact to give an alternative proof of the finding \cite{Mentzen2017}
that the centralizer of any $\mathcal{B}$-free dynamical system of Erd\""os type
is trivial.

This yields a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize such bounds. Using this
condition, we first prove that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$
admits a homomorphism to the projective hypercube of dimension $2k$. This
supports a conjecture of the third author which generalizes the four-color
theorem and relates to several outstanding conjectures such as Seymour's
conjecture on edge-colorings of planar graphs. Strengthening this result, we
show that the Kneser graph $K(2k+1,k)$ satisfies the conditions, thus implying
that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$ has fractional chromatic
number exactly $2+\frac{1}{k}$. Knowing that a smallest bound of odd-girth
$2k+1$ must have at least ${k+2 \choose 2}$ vertices, we build nearly optimal
bounds of order $4k^2$. Furthermore, we conjecture that the suprema of the
fractional and circular chromatic numbers for $K_4$-minor-free graphs of
odd-girth $2k+1$ are achieved by a same bound of odd-girth $2k+1$. If true,
this improves, in the homomorphism order, earlier tight results on the circular
chromatic number of $K_4$-minor-free graphs. We support our conjecture by
proving it for the first few cases. Finally, as an application of our work, and
after noting that Seymour provided a formula for calculating the edge-chromatic
number of $K_4$-minor-free multigraphs, we show that stronger results can be
obtained in the case of $K_4$-minor-free regular multigraphs.

negative-parity cluster bands that are paired with the positive-parity bands to
constitute the inversion doublets. We also offer the isoscalar monopole and

Negative-parity bands having $^{24}$Mg+$\alpha$ and $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C cluster

compares the quiet-Sun centroids with the flaring ones to obtain the Doppler

between the quiet-Sun and flaring line profiles. The final method calculates
the ""center-of-mass"" of the line profile, and compares the quiet-Sun and

signatures of both upflow and downflow in the Lyman lines, with speeds measured
in Sun-as-a-Star data of around 10 km/s, and speeds in the flare excess signal
of around 30 km/s All events showing upflows in Lyman lines are associated with
some kind of eruption or coronal flow in imaging data, which may be responsible

global symmetry operator in the partition function. We argue that for a special
choice of twists most of the excited states get projected out, leaving only
either mesonic states or states whose energy scales with $N$. When
$N\rightarrow \infty$ all excitations become suppressed at any compact radius

$k\geq 1$, there is an algorithm that computes in $O(2^{k}n\log^2 n)$ time for
any set $F$ of size at most $k$ the strongly connected components of the graph
$G\setminus F$. The running time of our algorithm is almost optimal since the
time for outputting the SCCs of $G\setminus F$ is at least $\Omega(n)$. The
algorithm uses a data structure that is computed in a preprocessing phase in
polynomial time and is of size $O(2^{k} n^2)$.
  Our result is obtained using a new observation on the relation between
strongly connected components (SCCs) and reachability. More specifically, one
of the main building blocks in our result is a restricted variant of the
problem in which we only compute strongly connected components that intersect a
certain path. Restricting our attention to a path allows us to implicitly
compute reachability between the path vertices and the rest of the graph in
time that depends logarithmically rather than linearly in the size of the path.
This new observation alone, however, is not enough, since we need to find an
efficient way to represent the strongly connected components using paths. For
this purpose we use a mixture of old and classical techniques such as the heavy
path decomposition of Sleator and Tarjan and the classical Depth-First-Search
algorithm. Although, these are by now standard techniques, we are not aware of
any usage of them in the context of dynamic maintenance of SCCs. Therefore, we
expect that our new insights and mixture of new and old techniques will be of
independent interest.

the minimum cost flow problem that lead to faster, strongly polynomial,
algorithms for both problems. One of the main results is a new algorithm for
the unit capacity min cost flow that culminates decades of efforts to match the
complexity of the fastest strongly polynomial algorithm known for the
assignment problem.
  The time cost tradeoff (TCT) problem in project management is to expedite the
durations of activities, subject to precedence constraints, in order to achieve
a target project completion time at minimum expediting costs, or, to maximize
the net benefit from a reward associated with project completion time
reduction. We devise here the all-min-cuts procedure, which for a given maximum
flow, is capable of generating all minimum cuts of equal value very efficiently
in average $O(m+n \log n)$ time.
  The all-min-cuts procedure implies faster algorithms for TCT problems: For a
project network on $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs, with $n'$ arcs of finite uniform
expediting costs, the run time is $O((n+n')(m+n\log n))$; for projects with
reward of $O(K)$ per unit reduction in the project completion time the run time
is $O((n+K)(m+n\log n))$.
  Using the primal-dual relationship between TCT and the minimum cost flow
problem (MCF) we generate faster strongly polynomial algorithms for various
cases of minimum cost flow: For the unit capacity MCF the complexity of our
algorithm is $O(n(m+n\log n))$, which is faster than any other strongly
polynomial known to date; For a minimum convex (or linear) cost $K$-flow
problem our algorithm runs in $O((n+K)(m+n\log n))$. This complexity of the
algorithm for any min cost $O(n)$-flow matches the best known complexity for

observation, carried out in 2007, of the nearby ($z=0.184$) luminous (L$_{\rm

intrinsically steep bare continuum is revealed compared to subsequent
observations, carried out in 2011 and 2013, where the source is fainter, harder
and more absorbed. We detected two pairs of prominent hard and soft flares,
restricted to the first and second half of the observation respectively. The
flares occur on timescales of the order of $\sim50$\,ks, which is equivalent to
a light-crossing distance of $\sim10\,R_{\rm g}$ in PDS\,456. From the spectral
variability observed during the flares, we find that the continuum changes
appear to be dominated by two components: (i) a variable soft component
($<2$\,keV), which may be related to the Comptonized tail of the disc emission,
and (ii) a variable hard power-law component ($>2$\,keV). The photon index of
the latter power-law component appears to respond to changes in the soft band
flux, increasing during the soft X-ray flares. Here the softening of the
spectra, observed during the flares, may be due to Compton cooling of the disc
corona induced by the increased soft X-ray photon seed flux. In contrast, we
rule out partial covering absorption as the physical mechanism behind the
observed short timescale spectral variability, as the timescales are likely too
short to be accounted for by absorption variability.

Specifically, we propose a new primitive called partial order preserving

leaves a sizable fraction of the data pairwise incomparable. Using only O(1)
persistent and $O(n^\epsilon)$ non-persistent client storage for
$0<\epsilon<1$, our POPE scheme provides extremely fast batch insertion
consisting of a single round, and efficient search with O(1) amortized cost for

schemes, which aim at improving spectrum utilization by allowing for the reuse
of idle licensed spectrum. Sensing a spectral band before using it makes sure
the legitimate users are not disturbed. Since information about these users'
signals is not necessarily available, the sensor should be able to conduct
so-called blind spectrum sensing. Historically, this has not been a feature of
cyclostationarity-based algorithms. Indeed, in many application scenarios the
information required for traditional cyclostationarity detection might not be
available, hindering its practical applicability. In this work we propose two
new cyclostationary spectrum sensing algorithms that make use of the inherent
sparsity of the cyclic autocorrelation to make blind operation possible. Along
with utilizing sparse recovery methods for estimating the cyclic
autocorrelation, we take further advantage of its structure by introducing
joint sparsity as well as general structure dictionaries into the recovery
process. Furthermore, we extend a statistical test for cyclostationarity to
accommodate sparse cyclic spectra. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
new methods achieve a near constant false alarm rate behavior in contrast to
earlier approaches from the literature.

the evolution of their radial density profiles. When evolved in isolation,
galaxies develop a type~II (down-bending) profile. In the cluster, the
evolution of the profile depends on the minimum cluster-centric radius the
galaxy reaches, which controls the degree of ram pressure stripping. If the
galaxy falls to $\sim 50\%$ of the virial radius, then the profile remains
type~II, but if the galaxy reaches down to $\sim 20\%$ of the virial radius the
break weakens and the profile becomes more type~I like. The velocity
dispersions are only slightly increased in the cluster simulations compared
with the isolated galaxy; random motion therefore cannot be responsible for
redistributing material sufficiently to cause the change in the profile type.
Instead we find that the joint action of radial migration driven by
tidally-induced spirals and the outside-in quenching of star formation due to
ram pressure stripping alters the density profile. As a result, this model
predicts a flattening of the age profiles amongst cluster lenticulars with
type~I profiles, which can be observationally tested. %

disk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a
gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of
the arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting
for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 \pm 2 degrees
and find semi-major axes of 1.50 \pm 0.01"" (278 au), 1.06 \pm 0.01"" (196 au)

height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine
point sources are detected between 2.1"" and 8.0"" separation and considered as
companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources,
which we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We
present the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ1615 in scattered
light. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface,
which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either
traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis >
2.35"" (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of
the feature, which will allow to distinguish between the two in future
observations. The most interesting scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of
the outer ring, requires the disk truncated at r ~ 360 au. The closest
companion candidate, if indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, would then be the
most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the
remaining four, require follow up observations to determine if they are bound

the need for prediction models that can be trained online (e.g., as part of a

the available predictors (i.e., the target and source predictors) and
guarantees convergence to the best weighted predictor. Furthermore, the use of
Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) allows for using more than a single source

for these S-type planets, which uses a correlation between the stellar radial

variations (EDVs). We test the capability of this technique by simulating a
realistic benchmark system and demonstrate its detectability with existing

number of RV observations, the RV-ETV diagrams allows us to distinguish between
prograde and retrograde planetary orbits and also the planetary mass can be
estimated if the stellar cross-correlation functions can be disentangled. We
also identify a new (though minimal) contribution of S-type planets to the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in eclipsing stellar binaries. We finally explore
possible detection of exomoons around transiting luminous giant planets and
find that the precision required to detect moons in the RV curves of their host

Online Handwritten Chinese Character (OLHCC) by incorporating the natural

eight-directional features in a natural way. In order to train SSDCNN, we
divide the process of training into two stages: 1) The training data is used to
pre-train the whole architecture until the performance tends to converge. 2)
Fully-connected neural network which is used to combine the stroke
sequence-dependent representation with eight-directional features and softmax
layer are further trained. Experiments were conducted on the OLHCCR competition
tasks of ICDAR 2013. Results show that, SSDCNN can reduce the recognition error
by 50\% (5.13\% vs 2.56\%) compared to the model which only use
eight-directional features. The proposed SSDCNN achieves 97.44\% accuracy which
reduces the recognition error by about 1.9\% compared with the best submitted
system on ICDAR2013 competition. These results indicate that SSDCNN can exploit
the stroke sequence information to learn high-quality representation of OLHCC.
It also shows that the learnt representation and the classical
eight-directional features complement each other within the SSDCNN
architecture.

(AGNs) contain relativistic jets. Strong magnetic field is a necessary
ingredient for jet formation, however, the advection of the external field in a
geometrically thin disk is inefficient. The gas with a small angular velocity
may fall from the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$ nearly freely to the circularization
radius $R_{\rm c}$, and a thin accretion disk is formed within $R_{\rm c}$. We
suggest that the external magnetic field is substantially enhanced in this
region, and the magnetic field at $R_{\rm c}$ can be sufficiently strong to
drive outflows from the disk if the angular velocity of the gas is low at
$R_{\rm B}$. The magnetic field is efficiently dragged in the disk, because
most angular momentum of the disk is removed by the outflows that leads to a
significantly high radial velocity. The strong magnetic field formed in this
way may accelerate jets in the region near the black hole either by the
Blandford-Payne or/and Blandford-Znajek mechanisms. We suggest that the radio
dichotomy of AGNs predominantly originates from the angular velocity of the
circumnuclear gas. An AGN will appear as a radio-loud (RL) one if the angular
velocity of the circumnuclear gas is lower than a critical value at the Bondi
radius, otherwise, it will appear as a radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This is supported
by the observations that RL nuclei are invariably hosted by core galaxies. Our
model suggests that the mass growth of the black holes in RL quasars is much
faster than that in RQ quasars with the same luminosity, which is consistent
with the fact that the massive black holes in RL quasars are systematically a
few times heavier than those in their RQ counterparts.

years to address mid-mass nuclei... As progress in the design of inter-nucleon
interactions is made, further efforts must be made to tailor many-body methods.
  Methods: We formulate a truncated configuration interaction method that
consists of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a highly truncated subspace of the
total N-body Hilbert space. The reduced Hilbert space is generated via the
particle-number projected BCS state along with projected seniority-zero two and
four quasi-particle excitations. Furthermore, the extent by which the
underlying BCS state breaks U(1) symmetry is optimized in presence of the
projected two and four quasi-particle excitations... The quality of the newly
designed method is tested against exact solutions of the so-called attractive
pairing Hamiltonian problem.
  Results: By construction, the method reproduce exact results for N=2 and N=4.
For N=(8,16,20) the error on the ground-state correlation energy is less than
(0.006, 0.1, 0.15) % across the entire range of inter-nucleon coupling defining
the pairing Hamiltonian and driving the normal-to-superfluid quantum phase
transition. The presently proposed method offers the advantage to automatically
access the low-lying spectroscopy, which it does with high accuracy.
  Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is
polynomial (N$^6$) in system size. It achieves an unprecedented accuracy on the
ground-state correlation energy, effective pairing gap and one-body entropy as
well as on the excitation energy of low-lying states of the attractive pairing
Hamiltonian. This constitutes a strong enough motivation to envision its
application to realistic nuclear Hamiltonians in view of providing a
complementary, accurate and versatile ab initio description of mid-mass
open-shell nuclei in the future.

short-range correlations found in all nuclei. Experimental observables related
to short-range correlations are connected with the high-momentum components of
one- and two-body momentum distributions. An intuitive understanding of
short-range correlations is provided by the suppression of the two-body density
in coordinate space at small distances.
  $\textbf{Purpose:}$ The Wigner function provides a quasi-probability
distribution in phase-space that allows to investigate short-range correlations
as a function of distance and relative momentum in a unified picture.
  $\textbf{Method:}$ The Wigner function for the deuteron is calculated for
bare and SRG evolved AV8' and N3LO interactions and investigated as a function
of distance, relative momentum and angular orientation. Partial momentum and
coordinate space distributions are obtained by integrating over parts of phase
space.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ The Wigner function shows a pronounced low-momentum peak
that is not affected by short-range correlations and a high-momentum shoulder
at small distances that reflects short-range correlations. Oscillations of the
Wigner function are related to interference of low- and high-momentum
components.
  $\textbf{Conclusions:}$ Short-range correlations are a truly
quantum-mechanical phenomenon caused by interference of low- and high-momentum
components in the wave function.

where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph of agent
utilities, but the algorithm can only elicit the agents' private information in
the form of a preference ordering for each agent induced by the underlying

the true optimum solution with respect to the hidden weights. Our techniques
yield universally truthful algorithms for a number of graph problems: a

for Max k-matching, a 6-approximation algorithm for Densest k-subgraph, and a

mechanisms which achieve both good revenue and good welfare simultaneously? To
address these questions, we give efficient pricing schemes which are guaranteed
to result in both good revenue and welfare, as long as the buyer valuations for

the aggregate buyer demand has a monotone hazard rate or is not too convex. We
also show that our pricing schemes have implications for any pricing which

of the non-singular change of posture, uniqueness domains, regions of feasible
paths, identification and classification of cuspidal robots. The chapter
focuses on 3-R orthogonal serial robots. The case of 6-dof robots and parallel
robots is discussed in the end of this chapter.

magnonic crystal with periodic changes of the anisotropy field in exchange
regime and the magnonic crystal composed of Fe and Ni stripes in dipolar regime
with exchange interactions included. We chose the symmetric unit cell for both
systems to implement the symmetry related criteria for existence of the surface
states. We investigated also the surface states induced by the presence of

Therefore, the surface states in both systems have the same properties. For
surface states existing in magnonic crystals in dipolar regime we demonstrated
that spin waves preserve distinct differences to the electronic crystals, which
are due to long-range dynamic dipolar interactions. We found that tuning of the
strength of magnetization pinning resulting from the surface anisotropy or

important for short-range mechanisms (SRM) of neutrinoless double beta decay
($0\nu\beta\beta$) mediated by heavy particle exchange. This is due to the
effect of color mismatch for certain effective operators, which leads to mixing
between different operators with vastly different nuclear matrix elements
(NMEs). In this note we analyze the QCD corrections for long-range mechanisms
(LRM), due to diagrams with light-neutrino exchange between a Standard Model
(V-A)$\times$(V-A) and a beyond the SM lepton number violating vertex. We argue
that in contrast to the SRM in the LRM case, there is no operator mixing from
color-mismatched operators. This is due to a combined effect of the nuclear
short-range correlations and color invariance. As a result, the QCD corrections
to the LRM amount to an effect no more than 60%, depending on the operator in
question. Although less crucial, taken into account QCD running makes
theoretical predictions for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay more robust also for LRM
diagrams. We derive the current experimental constraints on the Wilson
coefficients for all LRM effective operators.

semi-conjugacy classes of faithful actions on $S^1$ with pairwise disjoint
rotation spectra (except for $0$) such that each representation lifts to
$\mathbb{R}$. For the case of most Fuchsian groups $L$, we prove further that
this flexibility phenomenon occurs even locally, thus complementing a result of
K. Mann. We prove that each non-elementary free or surface group admits an
action on $S^1$ that is never semi-conjugate to any action that factors through
a finite--dimensional connected Lie subgroup in $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$. It is
exhibited that the mapping class groups of bounded surfaces have
non-semi-conjugate faithful actions on $S^1$. In the process of establishing
these results, we prove general combination theorems for indiscrete subgroups

combination theorems for representations into Baire topological groups. The
abundance of $\mathbb{Z}$--valued subadditive defect--one quasimorphisms on

On the one hand, a chain group either has a simple commutator subgroup or the
action of the group has a wandering interval. In the latter case, the chain
group admits a canonical quotient which is also a chain group, and which has a
simple commutator subgroup. On the other hand, every finitely generated
subgroup of $\operatorname{Homeo}^+(I)$ can be realized as a subgroup of a
chain group. As a corollary, we show that there are uncountably many

smoother on timescales of several weeks. The source also shows spectral
variability with the X-ray spectrum steepening when the source is brighter. We
do not detect any correlation between the UV flux and the X-ray spectral slope.
A cross correlation analysis suggests positive delays between X-rays and the UV
emission, favoring a scenario of disk reprocessing. Although the strength of
the correlation is moderate with a delay not well constrained (7.5+-7 days), it
is nevertheless indicative of a large disk reprocessing region, with a
separation between the X-ray and the UV emitting regions of the order of 1000
rG. The Ark120 correlation results are in agreement with those obtained in
similar monitoring studies. When combined together, the observations can be
well described by a linear relation between the X-ray/UV delay and the black
hole mass. Within the context of the simplest scenario where these delays
correspond to light-travel times, the implied distance between the X-ray source
and the UV disk reprocessing region is of the order of many hundreds of
gravitational radii.

revolving around the central theme of decomposing the group into ""chunks""

Examples of results in this class would be the Noether isomorphism theorems,
Zassenhaus' butterfly lemma, the Schreier refinement theorem for subnormal

Jordan-H\""older theorem.
  We discuss analogues of the above-mentioned results in the context of locally
compact quantum groups and linearly reductive quantum groups. The nature of the
two cases is different: the former is operator algebraic and the latter Hopf
algebraic, hence the corresponding two-part organization of our study. Our
intention is that the analytic portion be accessible to the algebraist and vice
versa.
  The upshot is that in the locally compact case one often needs further
assumptions (integrability, compactness, discreteness). In the linearly
reductive case on the other hand, the quantum versions of the results hold
without further assumptions. Moreover the case of compact / discrete quantum
groups is usually covered by both the linearly reductive and the locally
compact framework, thus providing a bridge between the two.

analysed 16 high-resolution spectra obtained using the UVES spectrograph at the
ESO 8.2m VLT telescope to measure radial velocities and determine the chemical
composition of the system. Cross correlation of the spectra with a synthetic
template yields a double-peaked cross-correlation function (CCF) for eight
spectra, and in one case there is evidence for the presence of a third peak.
Chemical analysis of the spectrum obtained by averaging all the spectra for
which the CCF showed a single peak found that the iron abundance is
[Fe/H]=-4.97. The system is also carbon enhanced with [C/Fe]=+3.91 (A(C)=7.44).
From the permitted oxygen triplet we determined an upper limit for oxygen of
[O/Fe]<+3.52 such that C/O>1.3. We are also able to provide more stringent

remote scenes sensed via sparse multispectral Lidar measurements. To a first
approximation, in the presence of a target, each Lidar waveform consists of a
main peak, whose position depends on the target distance and whose amplitude
depends on the wavelength of the laser source considered (i.e, on the target
reflectivity). Besides, these temporal responses are usually assumed to be
corrupted by Poisson noise in the low photon count regime. When considering
multiple wavelengths, it becomes possible to use spectral information in order
to identify and quantify the main materials in the scene, in addition to
estimation of the Lidar-based range profiles. Due to its anomaly detection
capability, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, coupled with an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, allows robust estimation of depth images
together with abundance and outlier maps associated with the observed 3D scene.
The proposed methodology is illustrated via experiments conducted with real
multispectral Lidar data acquired in a controlled environment. The results
demonstrate the possibility to unmix spectral responses constructed from
extremely sparse photon counts (less than 10 photons per pixel and band).

physics in which the dark sector comprises a vast ensemble of particle species
whose decay widths are balanced against their cosmological abundances. Previous
studies of this framework have focused on a particular class of DDM ensembles
--- motivated primarily by KK towers in theories with extra dimensions --- in
which the density of states scales roughly as a polynomial of mass. In this
paper, by contrast, we study the properties of a different class of DDM
ensembles in which the density of states grows exponentially with mass.
Ensembles with this Hagedorn-like property arise naturally as the ""hadrons""
associated with the confining phase of a strongly-coupled dark sector; they
also arise naturally as the gauge-neutral bulk states of Type I string
theories. We study the dynamical properties of such ensembles, and demonstrate
that an appropriate DDM-like balancing between decay widths and abundances can
emerge naturally --- even with an exponentially rising density of states. We
also study the effective equations of state for such ensembles, and investigate
some of the model-independent observational constraints on such ensembles that
follow directly from these equations of state. In general, we find that such
constraints tend to introduce correlations between various properties of these
DDM ensembles such as their associated mass scales, lifetimes, and abundance
distributions. For example, we find that these constraints allow DDM ensembles
with energy scales ranging from the GeV scale all the way to the Planck scale,
but the total present-day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be
spread across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these
energy scales are dialed from the Planck scale down to the GeV scale. Numerous
other correlations and constraints are also discussed.

parametrize both the surface term and the frequency variations for low-degree
solar data from Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) and medium-degree
data from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) using the mode inertia
together with cubic and inverse frequency terms. We find that for the central
frequency of rotationally split multiplets the cubic term dominates both the
average surface term and the temporal variation, but for the medium-degree case
the inverse term improves the fit to the temporal variation. We also examine
the variation of the even-order splitting coefficients for the medium-degree
data and find that, as for the central frequency, the latitude-dependent
frequency variation, which reflects the changing latitudinal distribution of
magnetic activity over the solar cycle, can be described by the combination of
a cubic and an inverse function of frequency scaled by inverse mode inertia.
The results suggest that this simple parametrization could be used to assess
the activity-related frequency variation in solar-like asteroseismic targets.

  Graphs",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies on cloud-radio access networks assume either signal-level or
scheduling-level coordination. This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme
as a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a
multi-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several
base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and, therefore, allows for joint
signal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds,
however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of
backhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is
composed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are
maintained at a fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of
maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling
them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to
a single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be
served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the
problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The
considered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a
maximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be
solved using efficient techniques. The paper then proposes solving the problem
using both optimal and heuristic algorithms that can be implemented in a
distributed fashion across the network. The proposed distributed algorithms
rely on the well-chosen structure of the constructed conflict graph utilized to
solve the maximum-weight independent set problem. Simulation results suggest
that the proposed optimal and heuristic hybrid scheduling strategies provide
appreciable gain as compared to the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with
a negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.

for systems of 2 and 3 spatial dimensions and generalises the work by [G.E.

Bogoliubov equation solutions for the condensate perturbed by a finite impurity
are calculated in the co-moving frame, which are formally equivalent up to a
dimension dependent form factor for general dimensions. From those solutions
the total energy of the perturbed system is determined as a function of the
width and the amplitude of the moving Gaussian impurity and its velocity.
Finally we derive the drag force the Gaussian impurity approximately
experiences as it moves through the superfluid, which proofs the existence of a
superfluid phase for finite extensions of the impurities below the speed of
sound and that the force increases monotonically with velocity until it
decreases again.

solve the dynamical equations for particles in covariant form, i.e. by using
the coordinate-independent proper time to parameterize particle world-lines in
space-time: to describe dynamics in the laboratory frame, there is no need to
use the laws of relativistic kinematics. It is sufficient to account for the
relativistic dependence of particles momenta on the velocity in the second
Newton's law. Then, the coupling of fields and particles is based on the use of
result from particle dynamics treated according to Newton's laws in terms of
the relativistic three-momentum and on the use of Maxwell's equations in
standard form. Previously, we argued that this is a misconception. Here we
describe in detail how to calculate the coupling between fields and particles
in a correct way and how to develop a new algorithm for a particle tracking
code in agreement with the use of Maxwell's equations in their standard form.
Advanced textbooks on classical electrodynamics correctly tell us that
Maxwell's equations in standard form in the laboratory frame and charged
particles are coupled by introducing particles trajectories as projections of
particles world-lines onto coordinates of the laboratory frame and then by
using the laboratory time to parameterize the trajectory curves. We show a
difference between conventional and covariant particle tracking results in the
laboratory frame. This essential point has never received attention in the
physical community. Only the solution of the dynamical equations in covariant
form gives the correct coupling between field equations in standard form and
particles trajectories in the laboratory frame. Previous theoretical and
simulation results in accelerator and plasma physics should be re-examined in
the light of the pointed difference between conventional and covariant particle
tracking.

which has baseline lengths up to 16 kilometers, the geography of the site
forces the height above mean sea level of the more distant antenna pads to be
significantly lower than the central array. Thus, both the ground level
meteorological values and the total water column can be quite different between
antennas in the extended configurations. During 2015, a network of six
additional weather stations was installed to monitor pressure, temperature,
relative humidity and wind velocity, in order to test whether inclusion of
these parameters could improve the repeatability of antenna position
determinations in these configurations. We present an analysis of the data
obtained during the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign of Oct. through Nov. 2015. The
repeatability of antenna position measurements typically degrades as a function
of antenna distance. Also, the scatter is more than three times worse in the
vertical direction than in the local tangent plane, suggesting that a
systematic effect is limiting the measurements. So far we have explored
correcting the delay model for deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the
measured air pressure and separating the partial pressure of water from the
total pressure using water vapor radiometer (WVR) data. Correcting for these
combined effects still does not provide a good match to the residual position
errors in the vertical direction. One hypothesis is that the current model of
water vapor may be too simple to fully remove the day-to-day variations in the
wet delay. We describe possible avenues of improvement, including measuring and
applying more accurate values of the sky coupling efficiency of the WVRs.

  theory",,,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $\Omega$-background is defined for supergravity, and a very general class
of such backgrounds is constructed for 11-dimensional supergravity.
11-dimensional supergravity in a certain $\Omega$-background is shown to be
equivalent to a 5-dimensional non-commutative gauge theory of Chern-Simons
type. M2 and M5 branes are expressed as 1 and 2-dimensional extended objects in
the 5-dimensional gauge theory. This 5-dimensional gauge theory is shown to
admit a consistent quantization with two coupling constants, despite being
formally non-renormalizable.
  A check of a twisted version of AdS/CFT is performed relating this
5-dimensional non-commutative gauge theory to the theory on N M5 branes,
wrapping an $A_{k-1}$ singularity and placed in an $\Omega$-background. The
operators on the M5 branes, in the $\Omega$-background, are described by a
certain chiral algebra which in the large N limit becomes a $W_{k+\infty}$
algebra. This chiral algebra is recovered from the 5-dimensional gauge theory.
  This argument also provides a holographic explanation of the result of
Maulik-Okounkov and Schiffmann-Vasserot that the $W_{k+\infty}$ algebra acts on
the equivariant cohomology of the moduli of instantons on an $A_{k-1}$
singularity.

more accurate nonlocal model in the small-wavelength (large-$q$) regime. We
also find substantial differences in the scattering amplitudes obtained from

low-frequency quasi-perfect sound absorption including transmission by using
the accumulation of cavity resonances due to the slow sound phenomenon. The
sub-wavelength panel is composed of periodic horizontal slits loaded by
identical Helmholtz resonators (HRs). Due to the presence of the HRs, the
propagation inside each slit is strongly dispersive, with near-zero phase
velocity close to the resonance of the HRs. In this slow sound regime, the
frequencies of the cavity modes inside the slit are down-shifted and the slit
behaves as a subwavelength resonator. Moreover, due to strong dispersion, the
cavity resonances accumulate at the limit of the bandgap below the resonance
frequency of the HRs. Near this accumulation frequency, simultaneously
symmetric and antisymmetric quasi-critical coupling can be achieved. In this
way, using only monopolar resonators quasi-perfect absorption can be obtained
in a material including transmission.

this issue by assuming a perfect knowledge of extrinsic parameters, and
assessing the maximal impact of this knowledge on our ability to extract
intrinsic parameters. However, we find only modest improvements in a few

problem is based on a recently developed algorithm by which each term of a
high-frequency asymptotic formula for dispersion relations can be computed for
Rayleigh waves that propagate in various directions along the free surface of a
vertically-inhomogeneous, prestressed, and weakly anisotropic half-space. As a
prime example of possible applications we focus on a thick-plate sample of AA
7075-T651 aluminum alloy, which has one face treated by low plasticity
burnishing (LPB) that induced a depth-dependent prestress at and immediately
beneath the treated surface. We model the sample as a prestressed,
weakly-textured orthorhombic aggregate of cubic crystallites and assume that by
nondestructive and/or destructive measurements we have ascertained everything
about the sample, including the LPB-induced prestress, before it is put into
service. Under the supposition that the prestress be partially relaxed but
other material parameters remain unchanged after the sample undergoes a period
of service, we examine the possibility of inferring the depth profile of the
partially relaxed stress by boundary measurement of Rayleigh-wave dispersion.

semi-period of modulation, giving place to a complex dynamic behaviour, where
the singular points of the beam (peak pressure, rarefaction, intensity and
acoustic radiation force) locate at different points on axis as a function of

absorption during the propagation in a lossy nonlinear medium both, for a

the acoustic radiation force displacement is the generation of shear waves at
