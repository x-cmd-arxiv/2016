between the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical geometry, and toric

all analysis can be done in the base of the perturbation method. Within this

\theta_{23}, \theta_{13}$) and the Dirac CP-violation phase ($\delta_{CP}$) is
established. This relation allows a prediction of $\delta_{CP}$ and the

1$\sigma$ region of the global fit for both the normal- and inverse neutrino

Hole)-BH binaries with merger time less than the age of the Universe

reason is that Pop III stars have no metal so that no mass loss is expected.
Then, in the final supernova explosion to NS, much mass is lost so that the
semi major axis becomes too large for Pop III NS-BH binaries to merge within
$\tau_{\rm H}$. However it is almost established that the kick velocity of the
order of $200-500{\rm~ km~s^{-1}}$ exists for NS from the observation of the
proper motion of the pulsar. Therefore, the semi major axis of the half of
NS-BH binaries can be smaller than that of the previous argument for Pop III

Monte Carlo simulations of Pop III NS-BH binaries including the kick of NS and
find that the event rate of Pop III NS-BH merger rate is $\sim 1 {\rm Gpc^{-3}

control (EOCP) are considered. To solve EOCP, the primal-dual active set (PDAS)
method, which is a special semismooth Newton (SSN) method, used to be a
priority in consideration of their locally superlinear convergence. However, in
general solving the Newton equations is expensive, especially when the
discretization is in a fine level. Motivated by the success of applying
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving large scale
convex minimization problem in finite dimension, it is reasonable to extend the
ADMM to solve EOCP. To numerically solve EOCP, the finite element (FE) method
is used for discretization. Then, a two-phase strategy is presented to solve
discretized problems. In Phase-I, an inexact heterogeneous ADMM (ihADMM) is
proposed with the aim of solving discretized problems to moderate accuracy or
using it to generate a reasonably good initial point to warm-start Phase-II.
Different from the classical ADMM, our ihADMM adopts two different weighted
inner product to define the augmented Lagrangian function in two subproblems,
respectively. Benefiting from such different weighted techniques, two
subproblems of ihADMM can be efficiently implemented. Furthermore, theoretical
results on the global convergence as well as the iteration complexity results
$o(1/k)$ for ihADMM are given. In Phase-II, in order to obtain more accurate
solution, the primal-dual active set (PDAS) method is used as a postprocessor

as neuronal elements of the human brain. Zhigalov, Kaplan, and Palva (2016,
Clin. Neurophysiol., 127(8), 2882-2889) revealed that neurofeedback flash
stimulation locked to the phase of high-amplitude occipital alpha influences
stimulus-locked occipital averages in the alpha-band. This feedback also
influences the power scaling of long-range temporal correlations in alpha-band
amplitude fluctuations. Seemingly, neurofeedback influences critical branching
alongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal activity and
evoked responses. However, the causal relations between these neuronal
long-range temporal correlations, sustained attention, and any avalanche
dynamics are called into question. Further, uncorrected concerns include false
discovery rate and an objective mathematical error in the precedent (Palva et
al., 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110(9), 3585-3590). An alternative set
of illustrative mathematical principles offers a preliminary fit to the effects
in the data. That is, neurofeedback influences the deterministic contribution
to the single-trial event-related potentials, which each flash evokes,
separately from the oscillatory alpha gain that those flashes cause.
Accordingly, distinct principles of this neurofeedback-related exponential
occipital oscillatory alpha gain and deterministic event-related potential
generation produce micro-behaviours with macroscale consequences: neurofeedback
causally influences power-scaling of long-range temporal correlations without

technique for medical images using stacked autoencoders, which encode images to

one of the most interesting issues in type theory. The correctness of subtyping
relations has been usually provided as the soundness for type safety. The
converse direction, the completeness, has been largely ignored in spite of its
usefulness to define the largest subtyping relation ensuring type safety. This
paper formalises preciseness (i.e. both soundness and completeness) of
subtyping for mobile processes and studies it for the synchronous and the
asynchronous session calculi. We first prove that the well-known session
subtyping, the branching-selection subtyping, is sound and complete for the
synchronous calculus. Next we show that in the asynchronous calculus, this
subtyping is incomplete for type-safety: that is, there exist session types T
and S such that
  T can safely be considered as a subtype of S, but T < S is not derivable by
the subtyping. We then propose an asynchronous subtyping system which is sound
and complete for the asynchronous calculus. The method gives a general guidance
to design rigorous channel-based subtypings respecting desired safety
properties. Both the synchronous and the asynchronous calculus are first
considered with lin ear channels only, and then they are extended with session
initialisations and c ommunications of expressions (including shared channels).

birth mass than the more numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to
increase in luminosity. In this fifth paper of the series, we construct the
birth mass function and hence derive the star formation history across the

$\sim0.010\pm0.001$ ($\sim0.012\pm0.007$) and 0.060$\pm0.005$
(0.052$\pm0.009$)M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ statistically (systematically)

previously with another camera. The total star formation rate in M33 within a
galactocentric radius of 14 kpc has varied between $\sim0.110\pm0.005$
($\sim0.174\pm0.060$) and $\sim0.560\pm0.028$ ($\sim0.503\pm0.100$) M$_\odot$

which the star formation rate was enhanced by a factor of a few -- one that
started $\sim6$ Gyr ago and lasted $\sim3$ Gyr and produced $\geq71$% of the
total mass in stars, and one $\sim250$ Myr ago that lasted $\sim200$ Myr and
formed $\leq13$% of the mass in stars. Radial star formation history profiles
suggest that the inner disc of M33 was formed in an inside-out formation
scenario. The outskirts of the disc are dominated by the old population, which
may be the result of dynamical effects over many Gyr. We find correspondence to
spiral structure for all stars, but enhanced only for stars younger than
$\sim100$ Myr; this suggests that the spiral arms are transient features and

density and far-UV radiation fields inferred from the atomic lines are not
consistent with the CO emission, indicating that the molecular gas excitation

an additional heating source. X-ray heating from the AGN is explored, and we
find that X-ray dominated region (XDR) models, in combination with PDR models,
can match the CO cooling without overproducing observed FS line emission. While
this XDR/PDR solution is favored given the evidence for both X-rays and
star-formation in the Cloverleaf, we also investigate alternatives for the warm

The {\it Kepler} light curves are of Algol-type and display deep and partial
eclipses, ellipsoidal variations, and pulsations of Delta Scuti type. We
analyzed the {\it Kepler} photometric data, complemented by phase-resolved
spectra from the R-C Spectrograph on the 4-meter Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak
National Observatory and determined the fundamental parameters of this system.
The low mass and oversized secondary ($M_2=0.20M_{\odot}$, $R_2=1.31R_{\odot}$)
is the remnant of the donor star that transferred most of its mass to the
gainer, and now the primary star. The current primary star is thus not a normal
$\delta$ Scuti star but the result of mass accretion from a lower mass
progenitor. We discuss the possible evolutionary history and demonstrate with
the MESA evolution code that the system can be understood as the result of
non-conservative binary evolution similar to that for the formation of EL CVn
type binaries. The pulsations of the primary star can be explained as radial
and non-radial pressure modes. The equilibrium models from single star
evolutionary tracks can match the observed mass and radius
($M_1=1.94M_{\odot}$, $R_1=1.67R_{\odot}$) but the predicted unstable modes
associated with these models differ somewhat from those observed. This work
presents a preliminary asteroseismic analysis of the abnormal Delta Scuti
pulsators, and we discuss the need for better theoretical understanding of such

  Aims: To determine the relevant formation mechanism(s) of the helium EUV

  Methods: We synthesise and study the emergent spectra from a 3D
radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation model. The effects of coronal
illumination and non-equilibrium ionisation of hydrogen and helium are included
self-consistently in the numerical simulation.
  Results: Radiative transfer calculations result in helium EUV line
intensities that are an order of magnitude larger than the intensities

While the analogous question for \emph{simple polygons} can easily be answered

results extend to the variant in which the segments are \emph{directed}, and
the counterclockwise traversal of a polygon should follow the orientation.

response signals to customers' consumption is central to any successful

can only send a limited number of signals. In addition, customer behavior also
depends on a large number of exogenous covariates. These two features lead to a
high dimensional inference problem with limited number of observations. In this
paper, we formulate this problem by using a multivariate linear model and adopt
an experimental design approach to estimate the impact of demand response
signals. We show that randomized assignment, which is widely used to estimate
the average treatment effect, is not efficient in reducing the variance of the
estimator when a large number of covariates is present. In contrast, we present
a tractable algorithm that strategically assigns demand response signals to
customers. This algorithm achieves the optimal reduction in estimation
variance, independent of the number of covariates. The results are validated
from simulations on synthetic data.

DE is described by quintessence (a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity),
this behaviour of $\gamma$ is excluded either because it would require a
transition to a phantom behaviour at some finite moment of time, or, in the
case of tracking DE at the matter dominated stage, because the relative matter
density $\Omega_m$ appears to be too small. An infinite number of solutions,
with $\Omega_m$ and $\gamma$ both constant, are found with $w_{DE}=0$
corresponding to Einstein-de Sitter universes. For all modified gravity DE
models satisfying $G_{\rm eff}\ge G$, among them the $f(R)$ DE models suggested
in the literature, the condition to have a constant $w_{DE}$ is strongly
violated at the present epoch. In contrast, DE tracking dust-like matter deep
in the matter era, but with $\Omega_m <1$, requires $G_{\rm eff} > G$ and an
example is given using scalar-tensor gravity for a range of admissible values
of $\gamma$. For constant $w_{DE}$ inside GR, departure from a quasi-constant
value is limited until today. Even a large variation of $w_{DE}$ may not result
in a clear signature in the change of $\gamma$. The change however is
substantial in the future and the asymptotic value of $\gamma$ is found while
its slope with respect to $\Omega_m$ (and with respect to $z$) diverges and

  Autonomous Systems",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian optimization has become a fundamental global optimization algorithm
in many problems where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. Recently,
there has been proposed a large number of new applications in fields such as
robotics, machine learning, experimental design, simulation, etc. In this
paper, we focus on several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous
systems: algorithm tuning, automatic control and intelligent design. All those
problems can be mapped to global optimization problems. However, they become
hard optimization problems. Bayesian optimization internally uses a
probabilistic surrogate model (e.g.: Gaussian process) to learn from the
process and reduce the number of samples required. In order to generalize to
unknown functions in a black-box fashion, the common assumption is that the
underlying function can be modeled with a stationary process. Nonstationary
Gaussian process regression cannot generalize easily and it typically requires
prior knowledge of the function. Some works have designed techniques to
generalize Bayesian optimization to nonstationary functions in an indirect way,
but using techniques originally designed for regression, where the objective is
to improve the quality of the surrogate model everywhere. Instead optimization
should focus on improving the surrogate model near the optimum. In this paper,
we present a novel kernel function specially designed for Bayesian
optimization, that allows nonstationary behavior of the surrogate model in an
adaptive local region. In our experiments, we found that this new kernel
results in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the
global search (exploration). We provide results in well-known benchmarks and
real applications. The new method outperforms the state of the art in Bayesian
optimization both in stationary and nonstationary problems.

on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), discrete memoryless channels (DMCs),
and optical channels. In contrast, our recent work introduced the
information-theoretic limits for covert communications over packet channels
whose packet timings are governed by a Poisson point process. However, actual
network packet arrival times do not generally conform to the Poisson process
assumption, and thus here we consider the extension of our work to timing
channels characterized by more general renewal processes of rate $\lambda$. We
consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the source of the packets on the
channel cannot be authenticated by Willie, and therefore Alice can insert
packets into the channel. We show that if the total number of transmitted
packets by Jack is $N$, Alice can covertly insert
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$ packets and, if she transmits more, she will
be detected by Willie. In the second scenario, packets are authenticated by
Willie but we assume that Alice and Bob share a secret key; hence, Alice alters
the timings of the packets according to a pre-shared codebook with Bob to send
information to him over a $G/M/1$ queue with service rate $\mu>\lambda$. We
show that Alice can covertly and reliably transmit $\mathcal{O}(N)$ bits to Bob

HB, between water and peptide groups, PGs, in beta sheets accords with an amino
acid intrinsic beta sheet preference. The present observations with Quantum
Molecular Dynamics, QMD, simulation with quantum mechanical treatment of every
water molecule solvating a beta sheet that would be transient in nature suggest
that this steric blocking is not applicable in a hydrophobic region unless a
cation is present, so that the amino acid beta sheet preference due to this
steric blocking is only effective in the presence of a cation. We observed
backbone hydration in a polyalanine and to a lesser extent polyvaline alpha
helix without a cation being present, but a cation could increase the strength
of these HBs.
  Parallel beta sheets have a greater tendency than antiparallel beta sheets of
equivalent small size to retain regular structure in solvated QMD, and a 4
strand 4 inter-PG HB chain parallel beta sheet was used. Stability was
reinforced by one surface being polyvaline, which buttressed the opposite
surface which was used for experimentation. A single Ca2+ ion was used for
investigation of individual binding events rather than bulk properties. No
direct binding between Ca2+ and the PG oxygen was observed in these
simulations, but perhaps it occurs at longer time scales as the transient beta
sheet unfolds.
  When linear scaling QMD methods that are accurate for peptide resonance,
Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding and the properties of water become
available, more extensive experiments having multiple ions of multiple types
could be performed at acceptable computational cost. It important that such
investigations be performed on protein secondary structures rather than model
amides so that sidechain limitation of backbone hydration and hence intrinsic
amino acid propensity is captured.

show that stochastic units, p-bits, can be interconnected to create robust
correlations that implement Boolean functions with impressive accuracy,
comparable to standard circuits. Also they are invertible, a unique property
that is absent in digital circuits. When operated in the direct mode, the input
is clamped, and the network provides the correct output. In the inverted mode,
the output is clamped, and the network fluctuates among possible inputs
consistent with that output. We present an implementation of an invertible gate
to bring out the key role of a three-terminal building block to enable the
construction of correlated p-bit networks. The results for this implementation
agree well with those from a universal model, showing that p-bits need not be
magnet-based: any three-terminal tunable random bit generator should be
suitable. We present an algorithm for designing a Boltzmann machine (BM) with
symmetric connections that implements a given truth table. We then show how BM
Full Adders can be interconnected in a partially directed manner to implement
large operations such as 32-bit addition. Hundreds of p-bits get precisely
correlated such that the correct answer out of 2^33 possibilities can be
extracted by looking at the mode of a number of time samples. With perfect
directivity a small number of samples is enough, while for less directed
connections more samples are needed, but even in the former case invertibility
is largely preserved. This combination of accuracy and invertibility is enabled
by the hybrid design that uses bidirectional units to construct circuits with
partially directed connections. We establish this result with examples
including a 4-bit multiplier which in inverted mode functions as a factorizer.

  P-value","11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, technical report",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of attempts have been made to improve accuracy and/or scalability of
the PC (Peter and Clark) algorithm, some well known (Buhlmann, et al., 2010;
Kalisch and Buhlmann, 2007; 2008; Zhang, 2012, to give some examples). We add
here one more tool to the toolbox: the simple observation that if one is forced
to choose between a variety of possible conditioning sets for a pair of
variables, one should choose the one with the highest p-value. One can use the
CPC (Conservative PC, Ramsey et al., 2012) algorithm as a guide to possible
sepsets for a pair of variables. However, whereas CPC uses a voting rule to
classify colliders versus noncolliders, our proposed algorithm, PC-Max, picks
the conditioning set with the highest p-value, so that there are no
ambiguities. We combine this with two other optimizations: (a) avoiding
bidirected edges in the orientation of colliders, and (b) parallelization. For
(b) we borrow ideas from the PC-Stable algorithm (Colombo and Maathuis, 2014).
The result is an algorithm that scales quite well both in terms of accuracy and
time, with no risk of bidirected edges.

Alice builds a codebook, with each codeword consisting of a sequence of packet

a packet to send at the appropriate time. Hence, leveraging our result from the

This paper introduces a new coloring method to add colors to near-infrared gray

directly adds the colors from the visible color image to the near-infrared gray
image; however, this method results in an unrealistic image because of the
discrepancies in brightness and image structure between the captured
near-infrared gray image and the visible color image. To solve the discrepancy
problem, first we present a new contrast-preserving mapping model to create a
new near-infrared gray image with a similar appearance in the luminance plane
to the visible color image, while preserving the contrast and details of the
captured near-infrared gray image. Then based on the proposed
contrast-preserving mapping model, we develop a method to derive realistic
colors that can be added to the newly created near-infrared gray image.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only preserve the
local contrasts and details of the captured near-infrared gray image, but
transfers the realistic colors from the visible color image to the newly
created near-infrared gray image. Experimental results also show that the
proposed approach can be applied to near-infrared denoising.

coding have been widely used for image restoration problems. These methods can
also be applied to the rain removal by learning two types of rain and non-rain
dictionaries and forcing the sparse codes of the rain dictionary to be zero
vectors. However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail
loss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for
shrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink
the sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the
input rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the
learned rain dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain
and non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of
objects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In the rain
regions, the correlation matrix between the rain and non-rain dictionaries is
calculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated
signal-atoms in the rain and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to
improve the removal of the rain structures. The experimental results show that
the proposed shrinkage-based sparse coding can preserve image structures and
avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions, and it can remove the rain
structures in the rain regions. Also, visual quality evaluation confirms that
the proposed method outperforms the conventional texture and rain removal
methods.

constant Merton portfolio strategy, a particular solution of the frictionless
limit of the problem, behaves like an attractor in the space of more general
solutions. The main effect of temporary market impact is to slow down the speed
of convergence to this constant Merton portfolio. The effect of permanent
market impact is to incentivize the FI to buy additional risky assets near the
end of the period. This property, that we name the Ponzi property, is related
to the creation and bursting of bubbles in the market. The proposed model can
be used as a stylized dynamic model of a typical FI in the study of the asset
fire sale channel relevant to understanding systemic risk and financial
stability.

are examined numerically to identify the scaling of their helicity and
vorticity norms during reconnection. For the volume-integrated enstrophy
$Z=\int\omega^2 dV$, a new scaling regime is identified for both configurations
where as the viscosity $\nu$ changes, all $\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ cross at
$\nu$-independent times $t_x$, identified as when the first reconnection events
end. Self-similar linear collapse of $B_\nu(t)=(\sqrt{\nu}Z)^{-1/2}$ can be
found for $t\lesssim t_x$ by linearly extrapolating $B_\nu(t)$ to zero at
critical times $T_c(\nu)$, then plotting $(T_c(\nu)-t_x)(B_\nu(t)-B_x)$ where
$B_x=B_\nu(t_x)$. The size $\ell^3$ of the periodic domains must be increased
as $\nu$ is decreased to maintain this scaling as implied by known Sobolev
space bounds. The anti-parallel calculations show that the linear collapse of
$B_\nu(t)$ begins with a quick, viscosity-independent exchange of the
circulation $\Gamma$ between the original vortices and the new vortices. Up to
and after the trefoil knots' first reconnection at time $t_x$, their helicity
${\cal H}$ is preserved, validating the experimental centreline helicity
observation of Scheeler et al (2014a). Because the cubic Navier-Stokes velocity
norm $L_3$ barely changes and the Navier-Stokes $\|\omega\|_\infty$ are bounded
by the Euler values, these flows are never singular. Despite this, the
Navier-Stokes $Z$ can, for a brief period, grow faster than the Euler $Z$ and
the following increase in the viscous energy dissipation rate $\epsilon=\nu Z$
shows $\nu$-independent convergence at $t\approx 2t_x$. Taken together, these
results could be a new paradigm whereby smooth solutions without singularities
or roughness could generate a $\nu\to0$ {\it dissipation anomaly} (finite
dissipation in a finite time) as $\ell\to\infty$, as seen in physical turbulent
flows.

described by a core of three dressed-quarks with running quark mass, and

attributes, such as color texture) intermediate between polygonal meshes and
point clouds. Dynamic or time-varying polygon clouds, like dynamic polygonal
meshes and dynamic point clouds, can take advantage of temporal redundancy for
compression, if certain challenges are addressed. In this paper, we propose
methods for compressing both static and dynamic polygon clouds, specifically
triangle clouds. We compare triangle clouds to both triangle meshes and point
clouds in terms of compression, for live captured dynamic colored geometry. We
find that triangle clouds can be compressed nearly as well as triangle meshes,
while being far more robust to noise and other structures typically found in
live captures, which violate the assumption of a smooth surface manifold, such
as lines, points, and ragged boundaries. We also find that triangle clouds can
be used to compress point clouds with significantly better performance than
previously demonstrated point cloud compression methods. In particular, for
intra-frame coding of geometry, our method improves upon octree-based
intra-frame coding by a factor of 5-10 in bit rate. Inter-frame coding improves
this by another factor of 2-5. Overall, our dynamic triangle cloud compression
improves over the previous state-of-the-art in dynamic point cloud compression
by 33\% or more.

at atomic resolution is a fundamental task in structural biology. Over the last
decade, remarkable progress has been made using ""single particle"" cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) for this purpose. In cryo-EM, hundreds of thousands of
two-dimensional images are obtained of individual copies of the same particle,
each held in a thin sheet of ice at some unknown orientation. Each image
corresponds to the noisy projection of the particle's electron-scattering
density. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image from this data is
typically formulated as a nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem for
unknowns which encode the angular pose and lateral offset of each particle.
Since there are hundreds of thousands of such parameters, this leads to a very
CPU-intensive task---limiting both the number of particle images which can be
processed and the number of independent reconstructions which can be carried
out for the purpose of statistical validation.
  Here, we propose a deterministic method for high-resolution reconstruction
that operates in an ab initio manner---that is, without the need for an initial
guess. It requires a predictable and relatively modest amount of computational
effort, by marching out radially in the Fourier domain from low to high
frequency, increasing the resolution by a fixed increment at each step.

directions hit an image sensor during a given time interval. When photons are
few and far in between, the concept of `image' breaks down and it is best to
consider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we
call `scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm
in that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take
place while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as
soon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for
biomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop
a framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as
possible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A
dynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of
this framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a
convolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated
images from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve
comparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using
less than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image. In addition, we
demonstrate that our algorithms work even when the illuminance of the

an underdetermined system, in which linear reconstructions will exhibit
artifacts. Another consequence of under-sampling is lower signal to noise ratio
(SNR) due to fewer acquired measurements. Even if an oracle provided the
information to perfectly disambiguate the underdetermined system, the
reconstructed image could still have lower image quality than a corresponding
fully sampled acquisition because of the reduced measurement time. The effects
of lower SNR and the underdetermined system are coupled during reconstruction,
making it difficult to isolate the impact of lower SNR on image quality. To
this end, we present an image quality prediction process that reconstructs
fully sampled, fully determined data with noise added to simulate the loss of
SNR induced by a given under-sampling pattern. The resulting prediction image
empirically shows the effect of noise in under-sampled image reconstruction
without any effect from an underdetermined system.
  We discuss how our image quality prediction process can simulate the
distribution of noise for a given under-sampling pattern, including variable
density sampling that produces colored noise in the measurement data. An
interesting consequence of our prediction model is that we can show that
recovery from underdetermined non-uniform sampling is equivalent to a weighted
least squares optimization that accounts for heterogeneous noise levels across
measurements.
  Through a series of experiments with synthetic and in vivo datasets, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the image quality prediction process and show that
it provides a better estimation of reconstruction image quality than the
corresponding fully-sampled reference image.

periodic eigenstates in non-Hermitian coupled chains of dipolar scatterers.
Guided modes supported by these structures can exhibit an EPD in their
dispersion diagram at which two or more Bloch eigenstates coalesce, in both
their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We show a second-order modal EPD associated
with the parity-time ($\cal{PT}$) symmetry condition, at which each particle
pair in the double chain exhibits balanced gain and loss. Furthermore, we also
demonstrate a fourth-order EPD occurring at the band edge. Such degeneracy
condition was previously referred to as a degenerate band edge in lossless
anisotropic photonic crystals. Here, we rigorously show it under the occurrence
of gain and loss balance for a discrete guiding system. We identify a more
general regime of gain and loss balance showing that $\cal{PT}$-symmetry is not
necessary to realize EPDs. Furthermore, we investigate the degree of detuning
of the EPD when the geometrical symmetry or balanced condition is broken. These
findings open unprecedented avenues toward superior light localization and
transport with application to high-Q resonators utilized in sensors, filters,
low-threshold switching and lasing.

of white dwarfs in radio frequencies. If AIC is triggered by accretion from a
companion star, a dense circumstellar medium can be formed around the
progenitor system. Then, the ejecta from AIC collide to the dense circumstellar
medium, making a strong shock. The strong shock can produce synchrotron
emission which can be observed in radio frequencies. Even if AIC occurs as a
result of white dwarf mergers, we argue that AIC may cause fast radio bursts if
a certain condition is satisfied. If AIC forms neutron stars which are so
massive that rotation is required to support themselves (i.e., supramassive
neutron stars), the supramassive neutron stars may immediately lose their
rotational energy by the r-mode instability and collapse to black holes. If the
collapsing supramassive neutron stars are strongly magnetized, they may emit
fast radio bursts as previously suggested. The AIC radio transients from the
single-degenerate systems may be detected in the future radio transient surveys
like Very Large Array Sky Survey or the Square Kilometer Array transient
survey. Because AIC is suggested to be a gravitational wave source,
gravitational waves from AIC may be accompanied by radio-bright transients
which can be used to confirm the AIC origin of observed gravitational waves.

the anomalous exponents $\Delta(q)$ of individual eigenfunctions, without the
assumption of strong correlations between the weights of consecutive

efficient and allows us to equilibrate water at extreme low temperatures in a
wide range of pressures. We find the line of temperatures of maximum density at
constant pressure and, at low temperature and high pressure, a phase transition
between high-density liquid and low-density liquid phases. The liquid-liquid
phase transition ends in a critical point. In the supercritical liquid region
we find for each thermodynamic response function a locus of weak maxima at high
temperature and a locus of strong maxima at low temperature, with both loci
converging at the liquid-liquid critical point where they diverge. Comparing
our results with previous works for the phase diagram of a many-body water
monolayer, we observe that the weak maxima of the specific heat are less
evident in bulk and appear only at negative pressures, while we find those of
compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient also at positive pressures in
bulk. However, the strong maxima of compressibility and thermal expansion
coefficient are very sharp for the bulk case. Our results clarify fundamental
properties of bulk water, possibly difficult to detect with atomistic models

  We conjecture that, for every algebraic integer $\alpha$, there is a natural

quadratic integers, an extension to cubic integers has been found by Adam Bohn.
The idea is to consider certain special classes of graphs for which the

graphs. Finally, extensions to the Tutte polynomial are mentioned briefly.

then reprocesses a fraction of the intrinsic luminosity which is emitted at
longer wavelengths. Thus, subject to radiative transfer corrections, the
fraction of the sky covered by the torus as seen from the central source (known
as the covering factor $f_c$) can be estimated from the ratio of the infrared
to the bolometric luminosities of the source as $f_c=L_{\rm torus}/L_{\rm
Bol}$. However, the uncertainty in determining $L_{\rm Bol}$ has made the
estimation of covering factors by this technique difficult, especially for AGN
in the local Universe where the peak of the observed SEDs lies in the UV
(ultraviolet). Here, we determine the covering factors of an X-ray/optically
selected sample of 51 type~1 AGN. The bolometric luminosities of these sources
are derived using a self-consistent, energy-conserving model that estimates the
contribution in the unobservable far-UV region, using multi-frequency data
obtained from SDSS, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{WISE}, 2MASS and UKIDSS. We
derive a mean value of $f_c\sim$0.30 with a dispersion of 0.17. Sample
correlations, combined with simulations, show that $f_c$ is more strongly
anti-correlated with $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ than with $L_{\rm Bol}$. This points
to large-scale torus geometry changes associated with the Eddington-dependent
accretion flow, rather than a receding torus, with its inner sublimation radius
determined solely by heating from the central source. Furthermore, we do not
see any significant change in the distribution of $f_c$ for sub-samples of

interference of two Comptonization continua: one coming from the up-scattering
of seed photons from the cold thin disk and the other fed by the synchrotron
emission of the hot flow. Variations of both X-ray components are caused by
fluctuations in mass accretion rate, but there is a delay between them
corresponding to the propagation timescale from the disk Comptonization radius
to the region of synchrotron Comptonization. If the disk and synchrotron
Comptonization are correlated, the humps in the power spectra are harmonically
related and the dips between them appear at frequencies related as odd numbers
1:3:5. If they are anti-correlated, the humps are related as 1:3:5, but the
dips are harmonically related. Similar structures are expected to be observed
in accreting neutron star binaries and supermassive black holes. The delay can
be easily recovered from the frequency of peaked noise and further used to
constrain the combination of the viscosity parameter and disk height-to-radius
ratio $\alpha (H/R)^2$ of the accretion flow. We model multi-peak power spectra

with the flow cryostat. We have also tested liquid nitrogen (~ 77 K) as an
alternative low-cost coolant. Using nitrogen, the microscope can operate at
temperatures of about 100 K and higher. As the flow of the coolant through the
cryostat can cause thermally induced two-phase flow fluctuations resulting in
instability in temperatures, preliminary tests were done in order to find ways
of avoiding the temperature oscillations and optimising the cooling process.

main, and still unsolved questions in galactic astronomy. However, theoretical
works are proposing new testable predictions whose detection is becoming
feasible with recent development in instrumentation. In particular, streaming
motions along spiral arms are expected to induce azimuthal variations in the
chemical composition of a galaxy at a given galactic radius. In this letter we
analyse the gas content in NGC 6754 with VLT/MUSE data to characterise its 2D
chemical composition and H$\alpha$ line-of-sight velocity distribution. We find
that the trailing (leading) edge of the NGC 6754 spiral arms show signatures of
tangentially-slower, radially-outward (tangentially-faster, radially-inward)
streaming motions of metal-rich (poor) gas over a large range of radii. These
results show direct evidence of gas radial migration for the first time. We
compare our results with the gas behaviour in a $N$-body disk simulation
showing spiral morphological features rotating with a similar speed as the gas
at every radius, in good agreement with the observed trend. This indicates that
the spiral arm features in NGC 6754 may be transient and rotate similarly as
the gas does at a large range of radii.

endowed with an integral complex closed 2-form, then there exists a line bundle

characterises the moduli space of line bundles with connection that arise in
this way. This theorem was extended to the case of p-forms by Gajer in [Ga]. In
this paper we provide a generalization of this theorem where we replace the
original manifold by a derived smooth Artin stack. Our derived Artin stacks are
geometric stacks on the \'etale (\infty,1)-site of affine derived smooth
manifolds. We introduce the notion of a n-shifted p-preplectic derived smooth
Artin stack in analogy with the algebraic case constructed by
Pantev-To\""en-Vaqui\'e-Vezzosi in [PTVV]. This is a derived smooth Artin stack
endowed with a complex closed (p+1)-form which has been cohomologically shifted
by degree n. It is a far reaching generalization of a p-preplectic manifold

when its n-shifted p-preplectic form is integral, then there exists a
(p+n-1)-gerbe with p-connection data and curvature corresponding to the

stack of gerbes with connections arising in this context. We construct a
canonical functor from the (\infty,1)-category of integral n-shifted
p-preplectic derived smooth Artin stacks to the (\infty,1)-category of linear
(\infty,p+n-1)-categories. When n=0 and p=1, this functor can be thought of
like a cohomology functor in that it associates to a derived presymplectic
smooth Artin stack a linear invariant in the form of a differential graded
module. In the general case we obtain higher prequantum categories which
requires the machinery of linear (\infty,n)-categories.

a sum of superstring field theory Feynman diagrams and deforms the integration
contours over loop energies of the Feynman diagram into the complex plane. In
this paper we establish the equivalence of the two prescriptions to all orders

diagram (or `chromosome map') is presented, built with a suitable combination
of stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W and F814W filters that
maximizes the separation between multiple populations. In the chromosome map of
most GCs (Type I clusters), stars separate in two distinct groups that we
identify with the first (1G) and the second generation (2G). This
identification is further supported by noticing that 1G stars have primordial
(oxygen-rich, sodium-poor) chemical composition, whereas 2G stars are enhanced
in sodium and depleted in oxygen. This 1G-2G separation is not possible for a
few GCs where the two sequences have apparently merged into an extended,
continuous sequence. In some GCs (Type II clusters) the 1G and/or the 2G
sequences appear to be split, hence displaying more complex chromosome maps.
These clusters exhibit multiple SGBs also in purely optical color-magnitude
diagrams, with the fainter SGB joining into a red RGB which is populated by
stars with enhanced heavy-element abundance. We measure the RGB width by using
appropriate colors and pseudo-colors. When the metallicity dependence is
removed, the RGB width correlates with the cluster mass. The fraction of 1G
stars ranges from ~8% to ~67% and anticorrelates with the cluster mass,
indicating that incidence and complexity of the multiple population phenomenon
both increase with cluster mass.

cross the boundary of a region intersect at least one sensor's sensing region.
The goal of the sensors is to detect intruders as they cross the boundary or as
they penetrate a protected area. The sensors are dependent on their battery
life. Restoring barrier coverage on sensor failure using mobile sensors with
minimum total displacement is the primary objective of this paper. A
centralized barrier coverage restoring scheme is proposed to increase the

proposed, which restores it by first finding existing alternate barrier. If
alternate barrier is not found, an alternate barrier is reconstructed by
shifting existing sensors in a cascaded manner. Detailed simulation results are

Quantum Field Theories, with a specific focus on supersymmetric black holes and
the perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections to the classical
area-law of Bekenstein-Hawking. To examine such corrections, we employ the
formalism of Sen's Quantum Entropy Function where the complete quantum entropy
of a supersymmetric black hole in theories of supergravity is defined as a
path-integral in the near-horizon region of the black hole. Evaluation of this
path-integral can then be conducted exactly using localization computation
techniques. Due to the exactness of the localization argument, the results
obtained in this manner are therefore formally expected to re-sum all
perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the classical area-law, and
thus connect to string-theoretic predictions. We investigate such connections
in detail for specific supersymmetric black holes in the hopes of strengthening
a Boltzmann-type interpretation of their thermodynamic entropy as arising from
the degeneracies of the microscopic gravitational constituents (the D-branes).
We find that this picture holds very precisely for two types of black holes
preserving four real supercharges in both four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=8$ and
$\mathcal{N}=4$ string theories and supergravities. From a broader point of
view, such results can be interpreted as providing important examples where
supergravity theories encode the complete low-energy dynamics of string
theories and provide a consistent effective picture. Some interesting
connections to the mathematical theory of modular forms and mock modular forms
are also exhibited.

the gauge/gravity correspondence. In holographic QCD, all baryons appear as
topological chiral solitons of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and (axial) vector

the Western Himalaya region. A network is formally defined and derived for seed
dispersion model of aforementioned species where vertices represent habitat
patches which are connected by an edge if the distance between the patches is
less than a threshold distance. We define centrality of a network and
computationally identify the habitat patches that are central to the process of
seed dispersion to occur across the network. We find that the network of
habitat patches is a scale free network and at the same time it also displays
small world property characterized by high clustering and low average shortest
path length. Due to high clustering, the spread of species is locally even as
seed disperse mutually among the member vertices of a cluster. Also since every
vertex is only a short number of steps away from every other vertex, the
species rapidly covers all the habitat patches in the component. Also due to
presence of hubs in the network the spread of species is greatly boosted
whenever the species establish and thrive in a hub patch and disperse to
adjacent patches. However, the network is not modular due to geographical
constraints, and is is negatively assortative as the high degree vertices are
connected to vertices of low degree.

calculating the activation barrier, $V_{act}$, experienced by the diffusing
$Li^{+}$ ion. We show that the effect of dopants on diffusion is both site
dependent and short ranged and thereby it paves ways for microscopic control of
ionic conductivity via selective dopants in this olivine phosphates. Dopants
with lower valence electrons (LVE) compared to Fe repel the $Li^{+}$ ion to
facilitate its outward diffusion, whereas higher valence electron (HVE) dopants
attracts the $Li^{+}$ ion to facilitate the inward diffusion. From the
electronic structure calculation we establish that irrespective of the dopant
M, except Mn, the band gap is reduced since the M-$d$ states always lie within
the pure band gap. Atomically localized $d$ states of HVE dopants lie above the
Fermi energy and that of LVE lie below it. Half-filled Mn-$d$ states undergo
large spin-exchange split to bury the dopant states in valence and conduction
bands of the pristine system and in turn the band gap remains unchanged in

It affects the synthesis of rare isotopes such as $^{17}$O and $^{18}$F, which
can provide constraints on astrophysical models. A new direct determination of
the $E_{\rm R}~=~64.5$~keV resonance strength performed at the Laboratory for
Underground Nuclear Astrophysics accelerator has led to the most accurate value
to date, $\omega\gamma = 10.0 \pm 1.4_{\rm stat} \pm 0.7_{\rm syst}$~neV,
thanks to a significant background reduction underground and generally improved
experimental conditions. The (bare) proton partial width of the corresponding
state at $E_{\rm x} = 5672$~keV in $^{18}$F is $\Gamma_{\rm p} = 35 \pm 5_{\rm

previously estimated thus leading to a factor of 2 increase in the
$^{17}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{14}$N reaction rate at astrophysical temperatures
relevant to shell hydrogen-burning in red giant and asymptotic giant branch
stars. The new rate implies lower $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O ratios, with important

travel through electron waveguides towards a detector potential barrier. Our
electrons sample an instantaneous voltage on the gate upon arrival at the

electrons interact with the barrier, which can be made as small as a few
picoseconds. The value of the instantaneous voltage can be determined by
varying the gate voltage to match the barrier height to the electron energy,
which is used as a stable reference. The test waveform can be reconstructed by
shifting the electron arrival time against it. We argue that this method has
scope to increase the bandwidth of voltage sampling to 100 GHz and beyond.

This method successfully circumvents the computational difficulties presented
by a direct solution of the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a long-lived
radical pair containing many hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. Using a modified
formulation of Floquet theory, treating the time-dependent magnetic field as a
perturbation, and exploiting the slow radical pair recombination, we show that
one can obtain a good approximation to the product yield by considering only
nearly-degenerate sub-spaces of the Floquet space. Within a significant
parameter range, the resulting method is found to give product yields in good
agreement with exact quantum mechanical results for a variety of simple model
radical pairs. Moreover it is considerably more efficient than the exact
calculation, and it can be applied to radical pairs containing significantly
more nuclear spins. This promises to open the door to realistic theoretical
investigations of the effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation on the
photochemically induced radical pair recombination reactions in the avian
retina which are believed to be responsible for the magnetic compass sense of
migratory birds.

  However, in developing countries such as Sudan the lack of qualified

only other option is to buy needed equipment and experimental setups from
specialized manufactures. The latter option is not feasible the departments in
developing countries where funding for education and research is scarce and

languages, 3D printers, desktop CNC machines and easy to use CAD/CAM softwares
the need for highly qualified technicians and expensive workshop equipment was
then relaxed \cite{nature-flypi}. The availability of such affordable, and
relatively easy to use tools had the effect of increasing the number of

the process of web data integration. Web structured data is usually associated
with entities or objects in a particular domain. In this paper, we aim to map
attributes of an entity in a given domain to pre-specified classes of
attributes in the same domain based on their values. To perform this task, we
propose a hybrid deep learning network that relies on the format of the
attributes' values. It does so without any pre-processing or using pre-defined
hand-crafted features. The hybrid network combines sequence-based neural
networks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural
networks (RNN), to learn the sequence structure of attributes' values. The CNN
captures short-distance dependencies in these sequences through a sliding
window approach, and the RNN captures long-distance dependencies by storing
information of previous characters. These networks create different vector
representations of the input sequence which are combined using a pooling layer.
This layer applies a specific operation on these vectors in order to capture
their most useful patterns for the task. Finally, on top of the pooling layer,
a softmax function predicts the label of a given attribute value. We evaluate
our strategy in four different web domains. The results show that the pooling
network outperforms previous approaches, which use some kind of input
pre-processing, in all domains.

resolved qualities of its neutral interstellar medium have remained unstudied.
Our HI images resolve the disk on physical scales of ~400 pc, allowing us to
undertake a detailed comparative study of the gaseous and stellar components.
The HI disk is asymmetric in the outer regions, and the areas of high HI mass
surface density display a crescent-shaped morphology that is slightly offset
from the center of the stellar populations. The HI column density exceeds 10^21

better in estimating d when compared with single photon emitters (SPEs). The
optimal entangled state is constructed from the eigenvectors of the generator

onboard the Hinode spacecraft and with the TIP-2 mounted at the VTT. We apply
state-of-the-art inversion techniques to both data sets to retrieve the
magnetic field and the corresponding vertical gradient. In the sunspot
penumbrae we detected patches of negative vertical gradients of the magnetic
field strength, i.e.,the magnetic field strength decreases with optical depth
in the photosphere. The negative gradient patches are located in the inner and
partly in the middle penumbrae in both data sets. From the SOT/SP observations,
we found that the negative gradient patches are restricted mainly to the deep
photospheric layers and are concentrated near the edges of the penumbral
filaments. MHD simulations also show negative gradients in the inner penumbrae,
also at the locations of filaments. Both in the observations and simulation
negative gradients of the magnetic field vs. optical depth dominate at some
radial distances in the penumbra. The negative gradient with respect to optical
depth in the inner penumbrae persists even after averaging in the azimuthal
direction, both in the observations and, to a lesser extent, also in MHD
simulations. We interpret the observed localized presence of the negative
vertical gradient of the magnetic field strength in the observations as a
consequence of stronger field from spines expanding with height and closing
above the weaker field inter-spines. The presence of the negative gradients
with respect to optical depth after azimuthal averaging can be explained by two
different mechanisms: the high corrugation of equal optical depth surfaces and
the cancellation of polarized signal due to the presence of unresolved opposite
polarity patches in the deeper layers of the penumbra.

The mass functions range between 0.08 to 0.55 M$_\odot$ which points to an

long-term variation on the time-scale of the orbital period for IRAS
17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933 and TW Cam. Our derived stellar luminosities
obtained from a calibrated PLC relation indicates that all except DY Ori and EP
Lyr, are post-AGB stars. DY Ori and EP Lyr are likely examples of the recently

the evolution of these stars was interrupted by a strong phase of binary
interaction during or even prior to the AGB. The observed eccentricities and

volume and study $v_n$ at the location of the $k$-th largest potential,
$x_{k,2^n}$. Our main result is that, for a certain class of potential
distributions, the solution exhibits a phase transition: for short time scales
$v_n(t_n,x_{k,2^n})$ behaves like a system without diffusion and grows as
$\exp\big\{(\xi_n(x_{k,2^n}) - \kappa)t_n\big\}$, whereas, for long time scales
the growth is dictated by the principle eigenvalue and the corresponding
eigenfunction of the operator $\kappa \Delta_n+\xi_n$, for which we give
precise asymptotics. Moreover, the transition time depends only on the
difference $\xi_n(x_{1,2^n})-\xi_n(x_{k,2^n})$.
  One of our main motivations in this article is to investigate the
mutation-selection model of population genetics on a random fitness landscape,
which is given by the ratio of $v_n$ to its total mass, with $\xi_n$
corresponding to the fitness landscape. We show that the phase transition of
the solution translates to the mutation-selection model as follows: a
population initially concentrated at $x_{k,2^n}$ moves completely to
$x_{1,2^n}$ on time scales where the transition of growth rates happens. The
class of potentials we consider involves the Random Energy Model (REM) of
statistical physics which is studied as one of the main examples of a random

positive conclusions on the continuity of spectral invariants and boundary

enables us to learn local policies for tasks with highly discontinuous contact

for which the LDA-HDA transformations are remarkably sharp, similar to what is
observed in experiments, and reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. Our
results are consistent with the view that LDA and HDA configurations are
associated with two distinct regions (megabasins) of the PEL that are separated
by a potential energy barrier. At higher temperature, we find that low-density
liquid (LDL) configurations are located in the same megabasin as LDA, and that
high-density liquid (HDL) configurations are located in the same megabasin as
HDA. We show that the pressure-induced LDL-HDL and LDA-HDA transformations
occur along paths that interconnect these two megabasins, but that the path
followed by the liquid is different than the path followed by the amorphous
solid. At higher pressure, we also study the liquid-to-ice-VII first-order
phase transition, and find that the behavior of the PEL properties across this

situation, the set $\text{CA}(G;A)$ of all cellular automata over $A^G$ is a
finite monoid whose basic algebraic properties had remained unknown. First, we
investigate the structure of the group of units $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ of
$\text{CA}(G;A)$. We obtain a decomposition of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ into a direct
product of wreath products of groups that depends on the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$
of periodic configurations for conjugacy classes $[H]$ of subgroups of $G$. We
show how the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$ may be computed using the M\""obius function
of the subgroup lattice of $G$, and we use this to improve the lower bound
recently found by Gao, Jackson and Seward on the number of aperiodic
configurations of $A^G$. Furthermore, we study generating sets of
$\text{CA}(G;A)$; in particular, we prove that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ cannot be
generated by cellular automata with small memory set, and, when all subgroups
of $G$ are normal, we determine the relative rank of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ on
$\text{CA}(G;A)$, i.e. the minimal size of a set $V \subseteq \text{CA}(G;A)$
such that $\text{CA}(G;A) = \langle \text{ICA}(G;A) \cup V \rangle$.

par with its kinetic energy $E_k$ in ejecta and a late time plateau in the UV,

the optically thick remnant stellar envelope produced by a central engine. By
negligible time scales of light crossing and radiative cooling of the envelope,
SN2015L's light curve closely tracks the evolution of this engine. We here
model its light curve by the evolution of black hole spin, during angular
momentum loss in Alv\'en waves to matter at the Inner Most Stable Circular
Orbit (ISCO). The duration is determined by $\sigma=M_T/M$ of the torus mass
$M_T$ around the black hole of mass $M$: $\sigma\sim 10^{-7}$ and $\sigma\sim
10^{-2}$ for SN2015L and, respectively, a long GRB. The observed
electromagnetic radiation herein represents a minor output of the rotational
energy $E_{rot}$ of the black hole, while most is radiated unseen in
gravitational radiation. This model explains the high-mass slow-spin binary
progenitor of GWB150914, as the remnant of two CC-SNe in an intra-day binary of
two massive stars. This model rigorously predicts a change in magnitude $\Delta
m\simeq 1.15$ in the light curve post-peak, in agreement with the light curve

from entirely descriptive ones to those deduced from the properties of the real
neurons. One of them, the diffusion leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model,
which is based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process that is restricted
by an absorbing barrier, can describe a wide range of neuronal activity in
terms of its parameters. These parameters are readily associated with known
physiological mechanisms. The other model is descriptive, Gamma renewal
process, and its parameters only reflect the observed experimental data or
assumed theoretical properties. Both of these commonly used models are related

such magnetic fields, aligned with the motion of the flow, on the formation and
emission properties of these circumstellar structures. Our axisymmetric,

heating and anisotropic thermal conduction show that the presence of the

shocks at Ha and [OIII] lambda 5007 which become fainter by about 1-2 orders of

experimental facts of the mass spectrometric data of carbon cluster emission
from the low-energy Cs irradiated single-walled carbon nanotubes . Firstly, the
diatomic carbon C(2) is the most abundant sputtered species for Cs+ in the
energy range 0.2 keV to 2.0 keV. Secondly, monatomic carbon C(1) is emitted
with the least sputtering yield. Thirdly, at low cesium energies i the emitted
species are C(2), C(3) and C(4). Lastly, as the irradiating Cs+ energy
increases, the normalized yield of atomic carbon monotonically increases while
clusters show gradual decrease and saturation. Sputtering of clusters is proved
here to be due to thermal spikes. Binary collision cascade theory does not
explain cluster sputtering. A statistical thermal model is developed to explain
the experimentally observed data. The probability of a cluster C(x) to be
emitted is shown to be proportional to that for the creation of an x-member
vacancy with formation energy E at temperature T as {exp(E/kT)+1}^(-1). The
energies of formation of single and double vacancies from DFT calculations and
the ratio of normalized experimental yields have been used to estimate spike
temperature. We show that by invoking thermal spikes, cluster emission from,

explained. We also suggest modifications to Monte Carlo type calculations of

pronounced CMR effect before a transition to metallic conduction occurs at

efficiency in organic solar cells (OSC). In this paper, we study singlet
fission in a pair of polyene molecules in two different stacking arrangements
employing exact many-body wave packet dynamics. In the non-interacting model,
the SF yield is absent. The individual molecules are treated within Hubbard and
Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) models and the interaction between them involves
transfer terms, intersite electron repulsions and site-charge--bond-charge
repulsion terms. Initial wave packet is constructed from excited singlet state
of one molecule and ground state of the other. Time development of this wave
packet under the influence of intermolecular interactions is followed within
the Schr\""odinger picture by an efficient predictor-corrector scheme. In
unsubstituted Hubbard and PPP chains, $2{}^1A$ excited singlet state leads to
significant SF yield while the $1{}^1B$ state gives negligible fission yield.
On substitution by donor-acceptor groups of moderate strength, the lowest
excited state will have sufficient $2{}^1A$ character and hence results in
significant SF yield. Because of rapid internal conversion, the nature of the
lowest excited singlet will determine the SF contribution to OSC efficiency.
Furthermore, we find the fission yield depends considerably on the stacking
arrangement of the polyene molecules.

possible mechanisms for the production of non-thermal particles and radiation
in galaxy clusters. Previous studies have shown that, while DM models can
reproduce the spectral properties of the radio halo in the Coma cluster, they
fail in reproducing the shape of the radio halo surface brightness because they
produce a shape that is too concentrated towards the center of the cluster with
respect to the observed one. However, in previous studies the DM distribution
was modeled as a single spherically symmetric halo, while the DM distribution
in Coma is found to have a complex and elongated shape. In this work we
calculate a range of non-thermal emissions in the Coma cluster by using the
observed distribution of DM sub-halos. We find that, by including the observed
sub-halos in the DM model, we obtain a radio surface brightness with a shape
similar to the observed one, and that the sub-halos boost the radio emission by
a factor between 5 and 20%, thus allowing to reduce the gap between the
annihilation cross section required to reproduce the radio halo flux and the
upper limits derived from other observations, and that this gap can be
explained by realistic values of the boosting factor due to smaller
substructures. Models with neutralino mass of 9 GeV and composition $\tau^+
\tau^-$, and mass of 43 GeV and composition $b \bar b$ can fit the radio halo
spectrum using the observed properties of the magnetic field in Coma, and do
not predict a gamma-ray emission in excess compared to the recent Fermi-LAT
upper limits. These findings make these DM models viable candidate to explain
the origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters. [abridged]

both cases, the $\rho$-parameter is found to be 0.12 $\pm$ 0.03. The results

investigate the synchronous state and its stability for a network with a cyclic
topology and with the evolution of the states satisfying the swing equations.
We calculate the number of stable equilibria and investigate both the linear
and nonlinear stability of the synchronous state. The linear stability analysis
shows that the stability of the state, determined by the smallest nonzero
eigenvalue, is inversely proportional to the size of the network. The nonlinear
stability, which we calculated by comparing the potential energy of the type-1
saddles with that of the stable synchronous state, depends on the network size
($N$) in a more complicated fashion. In particular we find that when the
generators and consumers are evenly distributed in an alternating way, the
energy barrier, preventing loss of synchronization approaches a constant value.
For a heterogeneous distribution of generators and consumers, the energy
barrier will decrease with $N$. The more heterogeneous the distribution is, the
stronger the energy barrier depends on $N$. Finally, we found that by comparing
situations with equal line loads in cyclic and tree networks, tree networks
exhibit reduced stability. This difference disappears in the limit of
$N\to\infty$. This finding corroborates previous results reported in the
literature and suggests that cyclic (sub)networks may be applied to enhance
power transfer while maintaining stable synchronous operation.

problem, leveraging recent advances in image analysis, open hardware, machine
learning and data fusion and is expected to result in increased geographical
coverage and temporal granularity of air quality data.

First the concept of a (labelled) transition system receives ample treatment
and then the following issues concerning process behaviour are elaborated in
the setting of transition systems: (i) concurrency and interaction, (ii)
abstraction, (iii) sequential composition, alternative composition, and
iteration, (iv) expressions that represent process behaviours, and (v)
structural operational semantics and equational laws for such expressions. To
quicken an intuitive understanding, direct connections with programs and
automata are established wherever appropriate. For the interested reader,
direct connections with Petri nets are also established. In each chapter,
except the last one, it shows that what has been dealt with so far still has
certain limitations. Each time, the next chapter is devoted to reducing the
limitations concerned.

one-sided approximations of a given function, to the extraction of fine
geometric singularities from semiconvex/semiconcave functions and DC-functions
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (difference of convex functions). Well-known examples of
(locally) semiconcave functions include the Euclidean distance and squared
distance functions. For a locally semiconvex function $f$ with general modulus,
we show that `locally' a point is a singular (non-differentiable) point if and
only if it is a scale $1$-valley point, and if $x$ is a singular point, then
locally the limit of the scaled valley transform exists at every point $x$ and
$ \lim_{\lambda\to \infty}\lambda V_\lambda (f)(x)=r_x^2/4$, where $r_x$ is the
radius of the minimal bounding sphere of the (Fr\'echet) subdifferential
$\partial_- f(x)$ and $V_\lambda (f)(x)$ is the valley transform at $x$. Thus
the limit function $\mathcal{V}_\infty(f)(x):=\lim_{\lambda\to+\infty}\lambda
V_\lambda (f)(x)=r_x^2/4$ gives a `scale $1$-valley landscape function' of the
singular set for a locally semiconvex function $f$, and also provides an
asymptotic expansion of the upper transform $C^u_\lambda(f)(x)$ when $\lambda
\to \infty$. For a locally semiconvex function $f$ with linear modulus we show
that the limit of the gradient of the upper compensated convex transform
$\lim_{\lambda\to+\infty}\nabla C^u_\lambda(f)(x)$ exists and equals the centre
of the minimal bounding sphere of $\partial_- f(x$, and that for a DC-function
$f=g-h$, the scale $1$-edge transform satisfies
$\liminf_{\lambda\to+\infty}\lambda E_\lambda (f)(x)\geq
(r_{g,x}-r_{h,x})^2/4$, where $r_{g,x}$ and $r_{h,x}$ are the radii of the
minimal bounding spheres of the subdifferentials $\partial_- g$ and $\partial_-
h$ of the convex functions $g$ and $h$ at $x$ respectively.

remarkable attention, since they appeared as objects in string theory. Although
there are many higher dimensional examples, the most known and most studied
fuzzy spaces are realized as matrix algebras defined by three Hermitian
matrices, which may be seen as fuzzy membranes or fuzzy surfaces. We give a
mapping between directed graphs and matrix algebras defined by three Hermitian

graphs we find matrix algebras that represent fuzzy spaces associated with
surfaces having genus 2 and higher.

(OVO, 1972-2014) and at the Bunker Est (BKE, 1999-2014) stations on the Mt.
Vesuvius. The OVO record is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 1.9.
We demonstrate that before 1996 this record presents a daily oscillation that
nearly vanishes afterwards. To determine whether a daily oscillation exists in
the seismic activity of the Mt. Vesuvius, we use the higher quality BKE record
that is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 0.2. We demonstrate that
BKE confirms that the seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius is higher during
nighttime than during day-time. The amplitude of the daily oscillation is
enhanced during summer and damped during winter. We speculate possible links
with the cooling/warming diurnal cycle of the volcanic edifice, with external
geomagnetic field and with magnetostriction that should also stress the rocks.
We find that the amplitude of the seismic daily cycle changes in time and has
been increasing since 2008. Finally, we propose a seismic activity index to
monitor the 24-hour oscillation that could be used to complement other
methodologies currently adopted to determine the seismic status of the volcano
and to prevent the relative hazard.

patterns and PM10 air pollution levels in the metropolitan area of Naples,
Italy. We found that severe air pollution crises occurred when the 850 and 500
hpa geopotential heights and their relative temperatures present maximum values
above the city. The most relevant synoptic parameter was the 850 hPa
geopotential height, which is located about 1500 m of altitude. We compared
local meteorological conditions (specifically wind stress, rain amount and
thermal inversion) against the urban air pollution levels from 2009 to 2013. We
found several empirical criteria for forecasting high daily PM10 air pollution
levels in Naples. Pollution crises occurred when (a) the wind stress was
between 1 and 2 m/s, (b) the thermal inversion between two strategic locations
was at least 3{\deg}C/200m and (c) it did not significantly rain for at least 7
days. Beside these meteorological conditions, severe pollution crises occurred
also during festivals when fireworks and bonfires are lighted, and during
anomalous breeze conditions and severe fire accidents. Finally, we propose a
basic model to predict PM10 concentration levels from local meteorological
conditions that can be easily forecast a few days in advance. The synthetic
PM10 record predicted by the model was found to correlate with the PM10
observations with a correlation coefficient close to 0.80 with a confidence
greater than 99%. The proposed model is expected to provide reliable
information to city officials to carry out practical strategies to mitigate air
pollution effects. Although the proposed model equation is calibrated on the
topographical and meteorological conditions of Naples, it should be easily
adaptable to alternative locations.

is found in cosmogenic radioisotopes (C-14 and Be-10) and in paleoclimate
records throughout the Holocene. Herein we demonstrate the astronomical origin
of this cycle. Namely, this oscillation is coherent to the major stable
resonance involving the four Jovian planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune - whose period is p=2318 yr. The Hallstatt cycle could derive from the
rhythmic variation of the circularity of the solar system disk assuming that
this dynamics could eventually modulate the solar wind and, consequently, the
incoming cosmic ray flux and/or the interplanetary/cosmic dust concentration
around the Earth-Moon system. The orbit of the planetary mass center (PMC)
relative to the Sun is used as a proxy. We analyzed how the instantaneous
eccentricity vector of this virtual orbit varies from 13,000 B. C. to 17,000 A.
D.. We found that it undergoes kind of pulsations as it clearly presents
rhythmic contraction and expansion patterns with a 2318 yr period together with
a number of already known faster oscillations associated to the planetary
orbital stable resonances. We found that a fast expansion of the Sun-PMC orbit
followed by a slow contraction appears to prevent cosmic rays to enter within
the system inner region while a slow expansion followed by a fast contraction
favors it. Similarly, the same dynamics could modulate the amount of
interplanetary/cosmic dust falling on Earth. These would then cause both the
radionucleotide production and climate change by means of a cloud/albedo
modulation. Other stable orbital resonance frequencies (e.g. at periods of 20
yr, 45 yr, 60 yr, 85 yr, 159-171-185 yr, etc.) are found in radionucleotide,
solar, aurora and climate records, as determined in the scientific literature.
Thus, the result supports a planetary theory of solar and/or climate variation.
