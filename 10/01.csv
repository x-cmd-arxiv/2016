to identify the parameters of the model. In most of the current literature, a
discrete random variable with a discrete transition density is introduced to
describe the transition between each submodel, leading to a further
approximation of the dynamical system by a jump Markov model. On the contrary,
we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to compute the probability of
each submodel given the measurement at that time step. Then, given the submodel
at each time step the latent state is estimated using the Kalman smoother.
Subsequently, the parameters are estimated by maximizing a surrogate function
for the likelihood. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated using
the simulated model of the JAS 39 Gripen aircraft.

analysis technique to extract stress-strain field gradient and divergence
representations from nanoindentation measurements. With this approach local
gradients and heterogeneities can be discovered to obtain more detail about the
sample's microstructure, thus enhancing the analytic capacity of the
nanoindentation technique. We analysed nanoindentation tests of bulk solid
substrates, namely bearing and tooling steel, and fused silica. Oscillations of
the stress-strain field gradient and divergence induced in the subsurface layer
by the nanoindentation experiment were revealed. The oscillations were
especially prominent in single measurements at low indentation depths (< 100
nm), whereas they were concealed in the averaged datasets. The amplitude of
stress-strain field divergence oscillations decayed as a sublinear power-law
when the indenter approached deeper atomic layers, with an exponent -0.9 for
the steel and -0.8 for the fused silica. The oscillations were interpreted as
alternating strain hardening-softening cycles induced in the subsurface layers
under the indenter load. A selective assessment of elastic and plastic
stress-strain field components indicated an elastic-plastic deformation process
where the normal strain is transformed into the shear strain leading to a
plastic deformation.

state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the

disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal

the harmonic nature of sound, the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy
to harmonically-related frequencies, as well as to small and local
displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit, the dictionary
of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors
located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in
turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that

surprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using
three photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is
not sufficient to fully describe the photons' behaviour in a scattering
process, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are
able to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by
generating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fibre tritter.
Using multiple degrees of freedom - temporal delays and polarisation - we
isolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment

particle motility eventually leads to phototaxis. Since the aligning torques
saturate at high gradients, a strongly rectified particle motion is found even

two-dimensional radar reflectivity fields from a sequence of radar images.
Under a Lagrangian integration scheme, we model the radar reflectivity data by
a spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive process which is driven by two
hidden sub-processes. The first sub-process is the dynamic velocity field which
determines the motion of the weather system, while the second sub-process
governs the growth or decay of the strength of radar reflectivity. The proposed
method is demonstrated, and compared with existing methods, using the real
radar data collected from the tropical southeast Asia. Note that, since the
tropical storms are known to be highly chaotic and extremely difficult to be
predicted, we only focus on the modeling of reflectivity data within a
short-period of time and consider the short-term prediction problem based on
the proposed model. This is often referred to as the nowcasting issue in the

to computationally manageable values using an approximation to
semi-relativistic MHD with an artificially reduced speed of light (Boris
correction). We present example solutions ranging from quiet to active Sun in

diffusivity for the effective coronal heating. We find that the (numerical)
magnetic Prandtl number determines the ratio of resistive to viscous heating

heating is expected to happen predominantly through viscous dissipation. We
find that reasonable solutions can be obtained with values of the reduced speed
of light just marginally larger than the maximum sound speed. Overall this
leads to a fully explicit code that can compute the time evolution of the solar

becoming increasingly prevalent. In typical distributed implementations, a
centralized master node breaks the data-set into smaller batches for parallel
processing across distributed workers to achieve speed-up and efficiency.
Several computational tasks are of sequential nature, and involve multiple
passes over the data. At each iteration over the data, it is common practice to
randomly re-shuffle the data at the master node, assigning different batches
for each worker to process. This random re-shuffling operation comes at the
cost of extra communication overhead, since at each shuffle, new data points
need to be delivered to the distributed workers.
  In this paper, we focus on characterizing the information theoretically
optimal communication overhead for the distributed data shuffling problem. We
propose a novel coded data delivery scheme for the case of no excess storage,
where every worker can only store the assigned data batches under processing.
Our scheme exploits a new type of coding opportunity and is applicable to any

relativity (GR): the linear memory and the non-linear, or Christodoulou memory.
These effects, especially the latter, depend on the specific form of Einstein
equation. It can then be speculated that in modified theories of gravity, the
memory can differ from the GR prediction, and provides novel phenomena to study
these theories. We support this speculation by considering scalar-tensor
theories, for which we find two new types of memory: the T memory and the S
memory, which contribute to the tensor and scalar components of gravitational
wave, respectively. In particular, the former is caused by the burst of energy
carried away by scalar radiation, while the latter is intimately related to the
no scalar hair property of black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. We estimate
the size of these two types of memory in gravitational collapses, and formulate
a detection strategy for the S memory, which can be singled out from tensor
gravitational waves. We show that (i) the S memory exists even in spherical
symmetry, and is observable under current model constraints, and (ii) while the
T memory is usually much weaker than the S memory, it can become comparable in
the case of spontaneous scalarization.

principles of quantum mechanics. Energy density of dark energy is obtained from
the quantum process of transition from the false vacuum state to the true
vacuum state. This is the class of the extended interacting $\Lambda$CDM
models. We consider the energy density of dark energy parametrization
$\rho_\text{de}(t)$, which follows from the Breit-Wigner energy distribution
function which is used to model the quantum unstable systems. The idea that
properties of the process of the quantum mechanical decay of unstable states
can help to understand the properties of the observed universe was formulated
by Krauss and Dent and this idea was used in our considerations. In the
cosmological model with the mentioned parametrization there is an energy
transfer between the dark matter and dark energy. In such a evolutional
scenario the universe is starting from the false vacuum state and going to the
true vacuum state of the present day universe. We find that the intermediate
regime during the passage from false to true vacuum states takes place. The
intensity of the analyzed process is measured by a parameter $\alpha$. For the
small value of $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha <0.4$) this intermediate (quantum) regime is
characterized by an oscillatory behavior of the density of dark energy while
the for $\alpha > 0.4$ the density of the dark energy simply jumps down. In
both cases (independent from the parameter $\alpha$) the today value of density
of dark energy is reached at the value of $0.7$. We estimate the cosmological
parameters for this model with visible and dark matter. This model becomes in
good agreement with the astronomical data and is practically indistinguishable

speeds. Aside from this knowledge, there has been very little work done on
beaming of gravitational radiation from GRBs, and the impact beaming could have
on gravitational wave (GW) detection. We determine the following: (1) the
observation angle at which the most power is emitted as a function of speed,
(2) the maximum ratio of power radiated away as a function of speed, and (3)
the angular distribution of power ratios at relativistic and non-relativistic
speeds. Additionally the dependence of the beaming of GW radiation on speed is
essentially the opposite of the beaming of electromagnetic (EM) radiation from
GRBs. So we investigate why this is the case by calculating the angular EM
radiation distribution from a linear electric quadrupole, and compare this
distribution to the angular gravitational radiation distribution from a GRB.

show how to realize this GEIT system in a realistic platform, using
non-degenerate Zeeman sublevels in alkali atoms. Specifically we choose
$^{87}$Rb atoms, which produce the negative dispersion around 795nm. The
current LIGO operates at 1064nm but future LIGO may operate at a wavelength
that is consistent with this atomic system. We present a theoretical analysis
for the susceptibilities of the system. To account for the QN from the GEIT
system, it is necessary to use the master equation (ME) approach. However, due
to the number of energy levels involved, applying the full ME approach to this
system is very complex. We have also shown earlier, in the reference cited
above, that under GEIT condition, the net enhancement in the
sensitivity-bandwidth product, as predicted by the ME, is close to that
predicted by applying the Caves model for a phase-insensitive linear amplifier.
Therefore we here use the Caves model for the QN from the NDM and this

a certain distance, is known as jump dynamics in the context of structural
glass formers. We generalize the concept of jump to the case of a spin glass,
by dividing the system in small boxes, and considering infrequent cooperative
spin flips in each box. Jumps defined this way share similarities with jumps in
structural glasses. We perform numerical simulations for the 3D
Edwards-Anderson model, and study how the properties of these jumps depend on
the waiting time after a quench. Similar to the results for structural glasses,
we find that while jump frequency depends strongly on time, jump duration and
jump length are roughly stationary. At odds with some results reported on
studies of structural glass formers, at long enough times, the rest time
between jumps varies as the inverse of jump frequency. We give a possible
explanation for this discrepancy. We also find that our results are
qualitatively reproduced by a fully-connected trap model.

discretized by the implicit second-order accurate Crank-Nicolson time

semi-discrete and discrete setting. The L2-stability of the method is ensured
by discretizing the boundary conditions of the distribution function at the
boundaries of the velocity domain by a suitable penalty term. The impact of the
penalty term on the conservation properties is investigated theoretically and
numerically. An implementation of the penalty term that does not affect the

number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups,
clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the

structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of
connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection

explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and
propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, Graph-IHT and Graph-GHTP, to

strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained

the two other HAeBes previously observed with the same instrumentation. Two
different scenarios have been explored in order to explain the compact line
emitting regions. A hot, several thousand K, blackbody disc is consistent with
the observations of HD 179218 and HD 141569. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) is
able to reproduce the bulk of the H$\alpha$ emission shown by HD 179218,
confirming previous estimates from MA shock modelling with a mass accretion
rate of 10^-8 Msun/yr, and an inclination to the line of sight between 30 and
50 degr. The H$\alpha$ profile of HD 141569 cannot be fitted from MA due to the
high rotational velocity of this object. Putting the CHARA sample together, a
variety of scenarios is required to explain the H$\alpha$ emission in HAeBe
stars -compact or extended, discs, accretion, and winds-, in agreement with
previous Br$\gamma$ spectro-interferometric observations.

information content of their accretion histories, for example in the form of
stellar population gradients. We present a detailed analysis of the stellar
halo properties of a statistically representative sample of early-type galaxies
from the Illustris simulation and show that stellar population gradients at
large radii can indeed be used to infer basic properties of galactic accretion
histories. We measure metallicity, age, and surface-brightness profiles in
quiescent Illustris galaxies ranging from $\mathrm{M}_\star = 10^{10} - 2\times
10^{12}\;\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and show that they are in reasonable agreement with
observations. At fixed mass, galaxies that accreted little of their stellar
halo material tend to have steeper metallicity and surface-brightness profiles
between 2 - 4 effective radii (R$_e$) than those with larger accreted
fractions. Profiles of metallicity and surface-brightness in the stellar halo
typically flatten from z = 1 to the present. This suggests that the accretion
of stars into the stellar halo tends to flatten metallicity and
surface-brightness profiles, a picture which is supported by the tight
correlation between the two gradients in the stellar halo. We find no
statistical evidence of additional information content related to accretion
histories in stellar halo metallicity profiles beyond what is contained in
surface-brightness profiles. Age gradients in the stellar halo do not appear to
be sensitive to galactic accretion histories, and none of the stellar
population gradients studied are strongly correlated with the mean merger
mass-ratio. Future observations that reach large radii outside galaxies will
have the best potential to constrain galactic accretion histories.

multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole of the CMB from a
possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an
intrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral
distortions with distinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz
and 276 GHz. The leakage into the quadrupole moment also induces a geometrical
distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode. The combination of these
effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced dipole
and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current
peculiar velocity measurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an
amplitude of $\Delta T = 30\mu$K into the monopole and quadrupole moments will
be detectable by a PIXIE--like experiment at $\sim 40~$nK ($2.5\sigma$) and
$\sim 130~$nK ($11\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.

super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), three main mechanisms to power their light

interaction with circumstellar material, and the decay of large amounts of
radioactive nickel in pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). Given the high
degree of diversity seen within the class, it is possible that all three
mechanisms are at work. PISN models can be self- consistently simulated from
the main sequence phase of very massive stars (VMS) through to their explosion.
These models robustly predict large amounts of radioactive nickel and thus very
luminous SN events. However, PISN model LCs evolve more slowly than even the
slowest evolving SLSNe. Multidimensional effects on the ejecta structure,
specifically the mixing of radioactive nickel out to large radii, could
alleviate this discrepancy with observation. Here we explore the
multidimensional effects on the LC evolution by simulating the explosion phase
in 1D, 2D, and 3D. We find that the ejecta from the multidimensional
simulations have slightly shallower abundance gradients due to mixing at shell
boundaries. We compute synthetic LCs whose shapes show no discernible
differences due to the multidimensional effects.

on fixed rate communication without any feedback channel, this paper
encompasses low-latency strategies with which one hop and multi-hop
communication issues are treated from an information theoretic perspective. By
defining the latency as the time required to make decisions, we prove that if
short messages can be transmitted in parallel Gaussian channels, for example,
via orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-like signals, there
exists an optimal low-latency strategy for every code. This can be achieved via
early-detection schemes or asynchronous detections. We first provide the
optimal achievable latency in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels for
every channel code given a probability block error $\epsilon$. This can be
obtained via sequential ratio tests or a ""genie"" aided, \textit{e.g}.
error-detecting codes. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Next, we show how early-detection can be effective with OFDM signals while
maintaining its spectral efficiency via random coding or pre-coding random
matrices. Finally, we explore the optimal low-latency strategy in multi-hop
relaying schemes. For amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)

first show that there exist a better low-latency strategy, for which AF relays
could transmit while receiving. This can be achieved by using amplify and

always possess definite values: e.g. the table is in some definite position,
even if we don't know what that is precisely. The traditional understanding is
that by assuming macro-realism one can derive the Leggett-Garg inequalities,
which constrain the possible statistics from certain experiments. Since quantum
experiments can violate the Leggett-Garg inequalities, this is taken to rule
out the possibility of macro-realism in a quantum universe. However, recent
analyses have exposed loopholes in the Leggett-Garg argument, which allow many
types of macro-realism to be compatible with quantum theory and hence violation
of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. This paper takes a different approach to
ruling out macro-realism and the result is a no-go theorem for macro-realism in
quantum theory that is stronger than the Leggett-Garg argument. This approach
uses the framework of ontological models: an elegant way to reason about
foundational issues in quantum theory which has successfully produced many
other recent results, such as the PBR theorem.

type theory. However, if we simply add the univalence axiom to type theory,
then we lose the property of canonicity - that every closed term computes to a
canonical form. A computation becomes `stuck' when it reaches the point that it
needs to evaluate a proof term that is an application of the univalence axiom.
So we wish to find a way to compute with the univalence axiom. While this
problem has been solved with the formulation of cubical type theory, where the
computations are expressed using a nominal extension of lambda-calculus, it may
be interesting to explore alternative solutions, which do not require such an
extension.
  As a first step, we present here a system of propositional higher-order
minimal logic (PHOML). There are three kinds of typing judgement in PHOML.
There are terms which inhabit types, which are the simple types over $\Omega$.
There are proofs which inhabit propositions, which are the terms of type
$\Omega$. The canonical propositions are those constructed from $\bot$ by
implication $\supset$. Thirdly, there are paths which inhabit equations $M =_A
N$, where $M$ and $N$ are terms of type $A$. There are two ways to prove an
equality: reflexivity, and propositional extensionality - logically equivalent
propositions are equal. This system allows for some definitional equalities
that are not present in cubical type theory, namely that transport along the
trivial path is identity.
  We present a call-by-name reduction relation for this system, and prove that
the system satisfies canonicity: every closed typable term head-reduces to a
canonical form. This work has been formalised in Agda.

establish the explicit rate of convergence uniformly in the class of all

We show that all three methods are inferentially first-order equivalent for
high-dimensional U-statistics in the sense that they achieve the same uniform
rate of convergence over all $d$-dimensional hyperrectangles. In particular,
they are asymptotically valid when the dimension $d$ can be as large as

technologies such as cryotherapy and cryopreservation. Foreign substances
almost always aid water freezing through heterogeneous ice nucleation, but the
molecular details of this process remain largely unknown. In fact, insight into
the microscopic mechanism of ice formation on different substrates is difficult
to obtain even via state-of-the-art experimental techniques. At the same time,
atomistic simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation frequently face
extraordinary challenges due to the complexity of the water-substrate
interaction and the long timescales that characterize nucleation events. Here,
we have investigated several aspects of molecular dynamics simulations of
heterogeneous ice nucleation considering as a prototypical ice nucleating
material the clay mineral kaolinite, which is of relevance in atmospheric
science. We show via seeded molecular dynamics simulations that ice nucleation
on the hydroxylated (001) face of kaolinite proceeds exclusively via the
formation of the hexagonal ice polytype. The critical nucleus size is two times
smaller than that obtained for homogeneous nucleation at the same supercooling.
Previous findings suggested that the flexibility of the kaolinite surface can
alter the time scale for ice nucleation within molecular dynamics simulations.
However, we here demonstrate that equally flexible (or non flexible) kaolinite
surfaces can lead to very different outcomes in terms of ice formation,
according to whether or not the surface relaxation of the clay is taken into
account. We show that very small structural changes upon relaxation
dramatically alter the ability of kaolinite to provide a template for the
formation of a hexagonal overlayer of water molecules at the water-kaolinite
interface, and that this relaxation therefore determines the nucleation ability
of this mineral.

Here we propose a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor hardware platform for the

platform combines semiconducting few-photon light-emitting diodes with
superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors to behave as spiking neurons.
These processing units are connected via a network of optical waveguides, and
variable weights of connection can be implemented using several approaches. The
use of light as a signaling mechanism overcomes fanout and parasitic
constraints on electrical signals while simultaneously introducing physical
degrees of freedom which can be employed for computation. The use of
supercurrents achieves the low power density necessary to scale to systems with

we develop a novel algorithm to address these two key problems. We treat each

of relays among both the source-relay phase and the relay-destination phase
according to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion.
Multiple relays equipped with dynamic buffers are then introduced in the
network, which allows the relays to store data received from the sources and
wait until the most appropriate time for transmission. { A greedy relay pair
selection algorithm is then developed to reduce the high cost of the exhaustive
search required when a large number of relays are involved.} The proposed
techniques effectively improve the quality of the transmission with an
acceptable delay as the buffer size is adjustable. An analysis of the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, the delay and a study of
the greedy algorithm are then carried out. Simulation results show that the

water is present in the gaseous state as water vapor and in the liquid phase as
cloud water and rain water. It thereby contains closures for the phase changes
condensation and evaporation, as well as the processes of autoconversion of
cloud water into rainwater and the collection of cloud water by the falling

  In this work we assume the velocity field to be given and prove rigorously
the global existence and uniqueness of uniformly bounded solutions of the

local well-posedness we first need to establish local existence results for
linear parabolic equations, subject to the Robin boundary conditions on the
cylindric type of domains under consideration. We then derive a priori

well as the iterative method by Alikakos to obtain uniform boundedness. The
evaporation term is of power law type, with an exponent in general less or

introduce a new framework for reasoning about choice of effect measure by
linking two separate versions of the risk ratio to a counterfactual causal

would not have been a case by the end of follow-up if untreated, who would have
responded to treatment by becoming a case; and the proportion of those
individuals who would have become a case by the end of follow-up if untreated
who would have responded to treatment by not becoming a case. Although
counterfactual outcome state transition parameters are generally not identified
from the data without strong monotonicity assumptions, we show that when they
stay constant between populations, there are important implications for model

these problems, a cascaded time-space Doppler ambiguity (CTSDA) may encounter,
i.e., time domain Doppler ambiguity (TDDA) in each channel arises first and
then spatial domain Doppler ambiguity (SDDA) among multi-channels arises
second. Accordingly, the multichannel SAR systems with different parameters are
investigated in three different cases with diverse Doppler ambiguity
properties, and a multi-frequency SAR is then proposed to obtain the RV
estimation by solving the ambiguity problem based on Chinese remainder theorem
(CRT). In the first two cases, the ambiguity problem can be solved by the
existing closed-form robust CRT. In the third case, it is found that the
problem is different from the conventional CRT problems and we call it a double
remaindering problem in this paper. We then propose a sufficient condition
under which the double remaindering problem, i.e., the CTSDA, can also be
solved by the closed-form robust CRT. When the sufficient condition is not
satisfied for a multi-channel SAR, a searching based method is proposed.

this to be zero for a discrete set of values of $\alpha$. While this result is
similar to that obtained previously for Saffman-Taylor fingers by surface
tension, the analysis for the problem with kinetic undercooling exhibits a
number of subtleties as pointed out by Chapman and King (2003) [The selection
of Saffman-Taylor fingers by kinetic undercooling, Journal of Engineering
Mathematics 46, 1-32]. The main subtlety is the behavior of the Stokes lines at
the finger tip, where the analysis is complicated by non-analyticity of
coefficients in the governing equation.

navigating the literature a significant challenge. Indeed, even authors of
papers that use permutations to model genome rearrangement can struggle to
interpret each others' work, because of subtle differences in basic assumptions

have been used to model genomes and genome rearrangement events, presenting
some features and limitations of each approach, and show how the various models

residual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend

branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial
properties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the
output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different
weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined
with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the
final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based
on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance

(items) to a set $P$ of $n$ customers (players) competing for the resources.
Each resource $j \in I$ has a same value $v_j > 0$ for a subset of customers
interested in $j$, and zero value for the remaining customers. The utility
received by each customer is the sum of the values of the resources allocated
to her. The goal is to find a feasible allocation of the resources to the
interested customers such that for the Max-Min allocation problem (Min-Max
allocation problem) the minimum of the utilities (maximum of the utilities)
received by the customers is maximized (minimized). The Max-Min allocation
problem is also known as the \textit{Fair Allocation problem}, or the
\textit{Santa Claus problem}. The Min-Max allocation problem is the problem of
Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines, and is also known as the $R \, | \,

  In this paper, we are interested in instances of the problem that admit a
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS). We show that an ordering property
on the resources and the customers is important and paves the way for a PTAS.
For the Max-Min allocation problem, we start with instances of the problem that
can be viewed as a \textit{convex bipartite graph}; a bipartite graph for which
there exists an ordering of the resources such that each customer is interested
in (has a positive evaluation for) a set of \textit{consecutive} resources. We
demonstrate a PTAS for the inclusion-free cases. This class of instances is
equivalent to the class of bipartite permutation graphs. For the Min-Max
allocation problem, we also obtain a PTAS for inclusion-free instances. These
instances are not only of theoretical interest but also have practical
applications.

performance gains with the deeper models. Our evaluation shows that the CNN
with 18 weight layers outperform the CNN with 3 weight layers by over 15% in

programmer-specified names for cached information. At runtime, each name
identifies a ""cache location"" for a dynamic data value or a sub-computation; in
sum, these cache location choices guide change propagation and incremental
(re)execution.
  We call a cache location name precise when it identifies at most one value or
subcomputation; we call all other names imprecise, or ambiguous. At a minimum,
cache location names must be precise to ensure that change propagation works
correctly; yet, reasoning statically about names in incremental programs
remains an open problem.
  As a first step, this paper defines and solves the precise name problem,
where we verify that incremental programs with explicit names use them
precisely. To do so, we give a refinement type and effect system, and prove it
sound (every well-typed program uses names precisely). We also demonstrate that
this type system is expressive by verifying example programs that compute over
efficient representations of incremental sequences and sets. Beyond verifying

the Dunkl kernel as well as the Dunkl Bessel function. The method uses the
introduction of an auxiliary variable in the series expansion of the kernel,
which is subsequently Laplace transformed. The kernel in the Laplace domain
takes on a much simpler form, by making use of the Poisson kernel. The inverse
Laplace transform can then be computed using the generalized Mittag-Leffler

they have been primarily restricted to the uniform nematic susceptibility, i.e.
q = 0 fluctuations. Here, we investigate the behavior of finite-momentum
nematic fluctuations by measuring transverse acoustic phonon modes with
wavelengths of up to 25 unit cells in the prototypical Fe-based compound
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. While the slope of the phonon dispersion gives
information about the uniform nematic susceptibility, deviations from this
linear behavior at finite but small wave-vectors are attributed to
finite-momentum nematic fluctuations. Surprisingly, these non-zero q
fluctuations lead to a softening of the phonon mode below the superconducting
transition temperature, in contrast to the behavior of the phonon velocity at q
= 0, which increases below $T_c$. Our work not only establishes a sound method
to probe long wavelength nematic fluctuations, but also sheds light on the
unique interplay between nematicity and superconductivity in Fe-based
compounds.

slow and fast observables, a broad plateau exists in the intermediate frequency
region, which contributes to a finite hidden entropy production. Assuming that
non-equilibrium behavior arises only from coupling of slow and fast processes,
we find that, at large observation time scae, the effective temperature for a
slow observable deviates only slightly from the bath temperature, accompanied
by an emerging well-defined effective potential landscape, while the deviation
is significant for a fast observable. Our study also identifies a wider range
of applicability of the Harada-Sasa equality in Markov jumping systems.

  Deep Learning Neural Networks","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate computational identification of promoters remains a challenge as
these key DNA regulatory regions have variable structures composed of
functional motifs that provide gene specific initiation of transcription. In
this paper we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze sequence
characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters and build their
predictive models. We trained the same CNN architecture on promoters of four
very distant organisms: human, plant (Arabidopsis), and two bacteria
(Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma pneumonia). We found that CNN trained on
sigma70 subclass of Escherichia coli promoter gives an excellent classification
of promoters and non-promoter sequences (Sn=0.90, Sp=0.96, CC=0.84). The
Bacillus subtilis promoters identification CNN model achieves Sn=0.91, Sp=0.95,
and CC=0.86. For human and Arabidopsis promoters we employ CNNs for
identification of two well-known promoter classes (TATA and non-TATA
promoters). CNNs models nicely recognize these complex functional regions. For
human Sn/Sp/CC accuracy of prediction reached 0.95/0.98/0,90 on TATA and
0.90/0.98/0.89 for non-TATA promoter sequences, respectively. For Arabidopsis
we observed Sn/Sp/CC 0.95/0.97/0.91 (TATA) and 0.94/0.94/0.86 (non-TATA)
promoters. Thus, the developed CNN models (implemented in CNNProm program)
demonstrated the ability of deep learning with grasping complex promoter
sequence characteristics and achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to
the previously developed promoter prediction programs. As the suggested
approach does not require knowledge of any specific promoter features, it can
be easily extended to identify promoters and other complex functional regions
in sequences of many other and especially newly sequenced genomes. The CNNProm
program is available to run at web server http://www.softberry.com.

quantum correlations do not have a classical analog and yet are influenced by
the classical dynamics. In this work, by modelling the quantum kicked top as a
multi-qubit system, the effect of classical bifurcations on the measures of
quantum correlations such as quantum discord, geometric discord, Meyer and
Wallach $Q$ measure is studied. The quantum correlation measures change rapidly
in the vicinity of a classical bifurcation point. If the classical system is
largely chaotic, time averages of the correlation measures are in good
agreement with the values obtained by considering the appropriate random matrix
ensembles. The quantum correlations scale with the total spin of the system,
representing its semiclassical limit. In the vicinity of the trivial fixed
points of the kicked top, scaling function decays as a power-law. In the
chaotic limit, for large total spin, quantum correlations saturate to a
constant, which we obtain analytically, based on random matrix theory, for the
$Q$ measure. We also suggest that it can have experimental consequences.

the reactive control of the available compute units to minimize the cloud
infrastructure cost under deadline-abiding execution. Dithen combines three key
properties: (i) the reactive assignment of individual multimedia tasks to
available computing units according to availability and predetermined
time-to-completion constraints; (ii) optimal resource estimation based on
Kalman-filter estimates; (iii) the use of additive increase multiplicative
decrease (AIMD) algorithms (famous for being the resource management in the
transport control protocol) for the control of the number of units servicing
workloads. The deployment of Dithen over Amazon EC2 spot instances is shown to
be capable of processing more than 80,000 video transcoding, face detection and
image processing tasks (equivalent to the processing of more than 116 GB of
compressed data) for less than $1 in billing cost from EC2. Moreover, the
proposed AIMD-based control mechanism, in conjunction with the Kalman
estimates, is shown to provide for more than 27% reduction in EC2 spot instance
cost against methods based on reactive resource estimation. Finally, Dithen is
shown to offer a 38% to 500% reduction of the billing cost against the current
state-of-the-art in CaaS platforms on Amazon EC2 (Amazon Lambda and Amazon
Autoscale). A baseline version of Dithen is currently available at

well constrained, owing to the observational and theoretical difficulties in
studying these diluted plasmas on large scales. 2) Method: we use recent
cosmological simulations with complex physics in order to connect the emergence
of non-thermal energy to the underlying evolution of gas and dark matter. 3)
Results: the impact of non-thermal energy (e.g. cosmic rays, magnetic fields
and turbulent motions) is found to increase in the outer region of galaxy
clusters. Within numerical and theoretical uncertainties, turbulent motions
dominate the budget of non-thermal energy in most of the cosmic volume. 4)
Conclusion: assessing the distribution non-thermal energy in galaxy clusters is
crucial to perform high-precision cosmology in the future. Constraining the
level of non-thermal energy in cluster outskirts will improve our understanding
of the acceleration of relativistic particles by cosmic shocks and of the
origin of extragalactic magnetic fields.

thereby addressing Einstein's puzzle about the incomprehensible
comprehensibility of the universe. Interpreting Einstein's reflections in terms

optical flow method (OF-BOS) is developed for measuring the pressure field of a
laser-induced underwater shock wave. Compared to BOS with the conventional
cross-correlation method in PIV (called PIV-BOS), by using the OF-BOS, the
displacement field generated by the small density gradient in water can be
obtained at the spatial resolution of one vector per pixel. The corresponding
density and pressure fields can be further extracted. It is particularly
demonstrated that the sufficiently high spatial resolution of the extracted
displacement vector field is required in the tomographic reconstruction to
correctly infer the pressure field of the spherical underwater shock wave. The
capability of the OF-BOS is critically evaluated based on synchronized
hydrophone measurements. Special emphasis is placed on direct comparison
between the OF-BOS with the PIV-BOS.

which he claimed to have translated into English from ancient Scottish-Gaelic
sources. The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century
bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited
comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and
Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in
literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous
literary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to
this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while
others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological
sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian,
initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the
two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the
poems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of
view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described
in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources.
Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric
epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant
network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer.
They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the
narratives known as Acallam na Sen\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the
Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.

means that retransmitted packets with the same sequence number are equal in
size to the packet of the original transmission, which is identical to the
packet generated from a message through the segmentation function, namely,
generated packet. Furthermore, we derive goodput formula using an approach to
derive the data-unit-size distribution. We investigate the effect of RPSP on
frame size distributions and goodput in a simple case when no collision happens
over the bit-error prone wireless network equipped with IEEE 802.11 Distributed
Coordination Function, which is a typical example of the stop-and-wait
protocol. Numerical results show that the effect gets stronger as bit error
rate increases and the maximum size of the generated packets is larger than the
mean size for large enough packet retry limits because longer packets will be
repeatedly corrupted and retransmitted more times as a result of RPSP.

network architectures that has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in
computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and other
domains. In November 2015, Google released $\textit{TensorFlow}$, an open
source deep learning software library for defining, training and deploying
machine learning models. In this paper, we review TensorFlow and put it in
context of modern deep learning concepts and software. We discuss its basic
computational paradigms and distributed execution model, its programming
interface as well as accompanying visualization toolkits. We then compare
TensorFlow to alternative libraries such as Theano, Torch or Caffe on a
qualitative as well as quantitative basis and finally comment on observed
use-cases of TensorFlow in academia and industry.

aspects of dyonic black holes in the presence of massive gravity. For the first
part of paper, thermodynamical properties of the bulk which includes black
holes are studied and the main focus is on critical behavior. It will be shown
that the existence of massive gravitons introduces remnant for temperature
after evaporation of black holes, van der Waals phase transition for
non-spherical black holes and etc. The consistency of different thermodynamical
approaches toward critical behavior of the black holes is presented and the
physical properties near the region of thermal instability are given. Next part
of the paper studies holographical aspects of the boundary theory.
Magnetization and susceptibility of the boundary are extracted and the
conditions for having diamagnetic and paramagnetic behaviors are investigated.
It will be shown that generalization to massive gravity results into the
existence of diamagnetic/paramagnetic phases in phase structure of the
hyperbolic and horizon flat of boundary conformal field theory.

to the Maxwell theory. We argue that this strict dual symmetry directly implies
the existence of the basic invariants of the electromagnetic fields.

combination of the impedance matching condition and the balance between the
leakage and the intrinsic losses, the system is designed to have broadband
unidirectional and quasi perfect absorption. The transfer and scattering matrix
formalism, together with numerical simulations based on the finite element
method are used to demonstrate the results showing excellent agreement between
them. The proposed system allows to construct broadband sound absorbers with
improved absorption in the low frequency regime using less amount of material
than the complete bulk porous layer.

modes of description which can usefully supplement each other, and neither on
its own contains the full story. The unified view explains the major features

instabilities induced by dissipation: it is well-known in fact that internal
viscous damping destabilizes the marginally stable Ziegler's pendulum and
Pfluger column (of which the Beck's column is a special case), two structures
loaded by a tangential follower force. The result is the so-called
'destabilization paradox', where the critical force for flutter instability
decreases by an order of magnitude when the coefficient of internal damping
becomes infinitesimally small. Until now external damping, such as that related
to air drag, is believed to provide only a stabilizing effect, as one would
intuitively expect. Contrary to this belief, it will be shown that the effect
of external damping is qualitatively the same as the effect of internal
damping, yielding a pronounced destabilization paradox. Previous results
relative to destabilization by external damping of the Ziegler's and Pfluger's
elastic structures are corrected in a definitive way leading to a new
understanding of the destabilizating role played by viscous terms.

The present study demonstrates this feasibility. It describes the design,
construction, measurement and experimental testing of such a jump. It improves
on previous efforts with more complete instrumentation, a larger range of jump
distances, and a new method for combining jumper- and board-mounted
accelerometer data to estimate equivalent fall height, a measure of impact
severity. It unequivocally demonstrates the efficacy of the engineering design
approach, namely that it is possible and practical to design and build free
style terrain park jumps with landing surface shapes that control for landing
impact as predicted by the theory.
