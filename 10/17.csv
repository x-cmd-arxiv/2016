motions, and uniform hand appearance, jointly tracking hand and object pose is
more challenging than tracking either of the two separately. Many previous
approaches resort to complex multi-camera setups to remedy the occlusion
problem and often employ expensive segmentation and optimization steps which
makes real-time tracking impossible. In this paper, we propose a real-time
solution that uses a single commodity RGB-D camera. The core of our approach is
a 3D articulated Gaussian mixture alignment strategy tailored to hand-object
tracking that allows fast pose optimization. The alignment energy uses novel
regularizers to address occlusions and hand-object contacts. For added
robustness, we guide the optimization with discriminative part classification
of the hand and segmentation of the object. We conducted extensive experiments
on several existing datasets and introduce a new annotated hand-object dataset.
Quantitative and qualitative results show the key advantages of our method:
speed, accuracy, and robustness.

levels of the normalized noise spectral density, compared to carbon nanotubes
and graphene. The temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the

the spinor-vector duality symmetry is rooted in the structure of the

we embark on exploration of this connection by the free fermionic formulation
to classify the symmetries of the two dimensional heterotic-string theories. We
use two complementary approaches in our classification. The first utilises a
construction which is akin to the one used in the spinor-vector duality.
Underlying this method is the triality property of $SO(8)$ representations. In

energy distribution (T=41K, $\beta$=1.95 or T=47K, $\beta$=1.6). The implied

the first derivative of the ground-state energy. Moreover, the type of the

viscosities and thicknesses, subject to vertical gravitational forces and with
an insoluble surfactant present at the interface, is investigated. The base
Couette flow is driven by the horizontal motion of the channel walls. Linear
and nonlinear stages of the (inertialess) surfactant and gravity dependent
long-wave instability are studied using the lubrication approximation, which
leads to a system of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the interface
and surfactant disturbances. The linear stability is determined by an
eigenvalue problem for the normal modes. The growth rates and the amplitudes of
disturbances of the interface, surfactant, velocities, and pressures are found
analytically. For each wavenumber, there are two active normal modes. For each
mode, the instability threshold conditions in terms of the system parameters
are determined. In particular, it transpires that for certain parametric
ranges, even arbitrarily strong gravity cannot completely stabilize the flow.
The correlations of vorticity-thickness phase differences with instability,
present when the gravitational effects are neglected, are found to break down
when gravity is important. The physical mechanisms of instability for the two
modes are explained with vorticity playing no role in them. Unlike the
semi-infinite case that we previously studied, a small-amplitude nonlinear
saturation of the surfactant instability is possible in the absence of gravity.
For certain parametric ranges, the interface deflection is governed by a
decoupled Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which provides a source term for a
linear convection-diffusion equation governing the surfactant concentration.
The full numerics confirm the prediction that, along with the interface, the
surfactant wave is chaotic, but the ratio of the two chaotic waves is constant.

small dimensionless damping constant $\lambda$ and allows a considerable
speed-up of computations by using high-order numerical integrators with a large

photothermal-based absorption spectrometers. These devices indirectly sense
absorption in the mid-infrared (MIR) by using near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths,
thereby enabling the realization of MIR absorption spectrometers without the
need for MIR photodetectors. Nevertheless, due to their comparatively large
index contrast and cross-sections, MIR Si strip waveguides are multi-mode at
NIR wavelengths, hindering device implementation. Here we present, for the
first time, an integrated Bragg grating waveguide filter for hybrid near- and
mid-infrared operation. Specifically, the filter is implemented in a
single-etch suspended silicon corrugated waveguide with an effectively
single-mode operation in NIR region for a waveguide cross-section as large as
0.5 um x 1.1 um. At the same time, the waveguide supports single-mode
propagation in MIR region. We demonstrate a long-period waveguide Bragg grating
yielding a sharp third-order Bragg resonance for the fundamental waveguide mode
and radiating the higher order modes. We experimentally demonstrate a notch
filter with a 4nm bandwidth and 40 dB extinction ratio with a
temperature-dependent Bragg wavelength shift of 70pm/K.

motivating key example) from a transmitter buffer to a receiver over a wireless
link while controlling the transmitter power (hence, the packet/job processing
rate). When each packet comes to the head-of-line (HOL) in the buffer, it is
given a deadline $D$ which is the maximum number of times the transmitter can
attempt retransmission in order to successfully transmit the packet. If this
number of transmission attempts is exhausted, the packet is ejected from the
buffer and the next packet comes to the HOL. Costs are incurred in each time
slot for holding packets in the buffer, expending transmitter power, and
ejecting packets which exceed their deadlines. We investigate how transmission
power should be chosen so as to minimize the total cost of transmitting the
items in the buffer. We formulate the optimal power control problem in a
dynamic programming framework and then hone in on the special case of fixed
interference. For this special case, we are able to provide a precise analytic
characterization of how the power control should vary with the backlog and how
the power control should react to approaching deadlines. In particular, we show
monotonicity results for how the transmitter should adapt power levels to the
backlog and approaching deadlines. We leverage these analytic results from the
special case to build a power control scheme for the general case. Monte Carlo
simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the resulting power control
scheme as compared to the optimal scheme. The resulting power control scheme is
sub-optimal but it provides a low-complexity approximation of the optimal power
control. Simulations show that our proposed schemes outperform benchmark
algorithms. We also discuss applications of the model to other practical
operational scenarios.

bounce occurs due to quantum cosmological effects described by the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The scalar field can be either conformally or
minimally coupled to gravity, and it can be massive or massless, without self
interaction. The analysis is made for models containing a single radiation
fluid, and for the more realistic case of models containing the usual observed
radiation and dust fluids, which can fit most of the observed features of our
Universe, including an almost scale invariant power spectrum of scalar
cosmological perturbations. In the conformal coupling case, the particle
production is negligible. In the minimal coupling case, for massive particles,
the results point to the same physical conclusion within observational
constraints: particle production is most important at the bounce energy scale,
and it is not sensitive neither to its mass nor whether there is dust in the
background model. The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger
than the bounce energy scale. On the other hand, the energy density of produced
massive particles depend on their masses and the energy scale of the bounce.
For very large masses and deep bounces, this energy density may overcome that
of the background. In the case of massless particles, the energy density of
produced particles can become comparable to the background energy density only
for bounces occurring at energy scales comparable to the Planck scale or above,
which lies beyond the scope of this paper: we expect that the simple
Wheeler-DeWitt approach we are using should be valid only at scales some few
orders of magnitude below the Planck energy. Nevertheless, in the case in which
dust is present, there is an infrared divergence, which becomes important only
for scales much larger than today's Hubble radius.

of gas from single nanopores, explicitly taking into account molecular gas-wall
interactions. We show that, in very narrow pores, the strong gas-wall
interactions are essential in determining the gas recovery behavior both
quantitatively and qualitatively. These interactions cause the total diffusion
coefficients of the gas molecules in nanopores to be smaller than those
predicted by kinetic theories, hence slowing down the rate of gas recovery.
These interactions also lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the
pore walls. Because of the desorption of these gas molecules during gas
recovery, the gas recovery from the nanopore does not exhibit the usual
diffusive scaling law (i.e., the accumulative recovery scales as $R \sim
t^{1/2}$ but follows a super-diffusive scaling law $R \sim t^n$ ($n>0.5$),
which is similar to that observed in some field experiments. For the system
studied here, the super-diffusive gas recovery scaling law can be captured well
by continuum models in which the gas adsorption and desorption from pore walls

computer vision. However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to
fit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete
data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to
measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence
proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure
both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric
models. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric
model fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric
model space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set.
Models in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of
parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very
useful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete
(incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example,
most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method
uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity
metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method
also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject
dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of

the solution of problems of wave propagation, scattering and radiation for

well as launching and/or termination sites and other nonuniformities. Based on
use of a ""slow-rise"" smooth-windowing technique in conjunction with free-space
Green functions and associated integral representations, the proposed approach
produces numerical solutions with errors that decrease faster than any negative
power of the window size. The proposed methodology bypasses some of the most
significant challenges associated with waveguide simulation. In particular the
WGF approach handles spatially-infinite dielectric waveguide structures without
recourse to absorbing boundary conditions, it facilitates proper treatment of
complex geometries, and it seamlessly incorporates the open-waveguide character
and associated radiation conditions inherent in the problem under

of a variety of numerical results for two-dimensional open-waveguide

definable sets (definable sets symmetrized by pulling back under symmetric
polynomial maps of fixed degree) in arbitrary o-minimal structures over

polynomially bounded complexity for computing these equivariant Betti numbers.
In contrast, the problem of computing the ordinary Betti numbers of (not

problem, and all known algorithms for this problem have doubly exponential
complexity.

unequal-path interferometers that can be used to measure frequency states in a
high-dimensional quantum distribution system. In particular, we demonstrate
that commercially-available interferometers have sufficient environmental
isolation so that they maintain an interference visibility greater than 98.5\%
at a wavelength of 1550 nm over extended periods with only moderate passive
control of the interferometer temperature ($< \pm0.50 ^{\circ}$C).
Specifically, we characterize two interferometers that have matched delays: one
with a free-spectral range of 2.5 GHz, and the other with 1.25 GHz. We find
that the relative path of these interferometers drifts less than 3~nm over a
period of one hour during which the temperature fluctuates by $<\pm$0.10
$^{\circ} $C. When we purposely heat the interferometers over a temperature
range of 20-50 $^{\circ}$C, we find that the temperature sensitivity is
different for each interferometer, likely due to slight manufacturing errors
during the temperature compensation procedure. Over this range, we measure a
path-length shift of 26 $\pm$ 9 nm/$^{\circ} $C for the 2.5 GHz interferometer.
For the 1.25 GHz interferometer, the path-length shift is nonlinear and is
locally equal to zero at a temperature of 37.1 $^{\circ}$C and is 50 $\pm$ 17
nm/$^{\circ} $C at 22 $^{\circ}$C. With these devices, we realize a cascade of
1.25 GHz and 2.5 GHz interferometers to measure four-dimensional classical
frequency states created by modulating a stable and continuous-wave laser. We
observe a visibility $>99\%$ over an hour, which is mainly limited by our
ability to precisely generate these states. Overall, our results indicate that
these interferometers are well suited for realistic time-frequency quantum
distribution protocols.

the products of the two-qubit singlets and a Fock state, where the qubits are
decoupled from the photon field. These spin singlets can be used to store
quantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation,
driving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark
states is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling
strength. We have obtained a novel kind of dark-like states for the multi-qubit
and multi-photon Rabi models, whose eigenenergies are also constant in the
whole coupling regime. Unlike the dark states, the qubits and photon field are
coupled in the dark-like states. Furthermore, the photon numbers are bounded
from above commonly at 1, which is different from that for the one-qubit case.
The existence conditions of the dark-like states are simpler than exact
isolated solutions, and may be fine tuned in experiments. While the
single-qubit and multi-photon Rabi model is well-defined only if the photon
number $M\leq2$ and the coupling strength is below a certain critical value,

XMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium

be ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in
the Hall MHD range - this is shown to be consistent with previous results in

sets of visual attributes from images or videos for various tasks. Despite
their good performance in some classification tasks, it is difficult to
evaluate whether the attributes discovered by these methods are meaningful and
which methods are the most appropriate to discover attributes for visual
descriptions. In its simplest form, such an evaluation can be performed by
manually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept
distinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an
attribute. This manual checking is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. In
addition, comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it
is not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more
meaningful than the others. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute
meaningfulness metric to address this challenging problem. With this metric,
automatic quantitative evaluation can be performed on the attribute sets; thus,
reducing the enormous effort to perform manual evaluation. The proposed metric
is applied to some recent automatic attribute discovery and hashing methods on
four attribute-labelled datasets. To further validate the efficacy of the
proposed method, we conducted a user study. In addition, we also compared our
metric with a semi-supervised attribute discover method using the mixture of
probabilistic PCA. In our evaluation, we gleaned several insights that could be
beneficial in developing new automatic attribute discovery methods.

optimization procedure which allows for adaptive selection of regressors under
sparse high dimensional designs. Here we extend the idea of SLOPE to deal with
the situation when one aims at selecting whole groups of explanatory variables
instead of single regressors. Such groups can be formed by clustering strongly
correlated predictors or groups of dummy variables corresponding to different
levels of the same qualitative predictor. We formulate the respective convex
optimization problem, gSLOPE (group SLOPE), and propose an efficient algorithm
for its solution. We also define a notion of the group false discovery rate
(gFDR) and provide a choice of the sequence of tuning parameters for gSLOPE so
that gFDR is provably controlled at a prespecified level if the groups of
variables are orthogonal to each other. Moreover, we prove that the resulting
procedure adapts to unknown sparsity and is asymptotically minimax with respect
to the estimation of the proportions of variance of the response variable
explained by regressors from different groups. We also provide a method for the
choice of the regularizing sequence when variables in different groups are not
orthogonal but statistically independent and illustrate its good properties
with computer simulations. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of gSLOPE in
the context of Genome Wide Association Studies. R package grpSLOPE with

  Visual Stream",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have structures that are loosely
related to that of the primate visual cortex. Surprisingly, when these networks
are trained for object classification, the activity of their early,
intermediate, and later layers becomes closely related to activity patterns in
corresponding parts of the primate ventral visual stream. The activity
statistics are far from identical, but perhaps remaining differences can be
minimized in order to produce artificial networks with highly brain-like
activity and performance, which would provide a rich source of insight into
primate vision. One way to align CNN activity more closely with neural activity
is to add cost functions that directly drive deep layers to approximate neural
recordings. However, suitably large datasets are particularly difficult to
obtain for deep structures, such as the primate middle temporal area (MT). To
work around this barrier, we have developed a rich empirical model of activity
in MT. The model is pixel-computable, so it can provide an arbitrarily large
(but approximate) set of labels to better guide learning in the corresponding
layers of deep networks. Our model approximates a number of MT phenomena more
closely than previous models. Furthermore, our model approximates population
statistics in detail through fourteen parameter distributions that we estimated
from the electrophysiology literature. In general, deep networks with internal
representations that closely approximate those of the brain may help to clarify
the mechanisms that produce these representations, and the roles of various
properties of these representations in performance of vision tasks. Although
our empirical model inevitably differs from real neural activity, it allows
tuning properties to be modulated independently, which may allow very detailed
exploration of the origins and functional roles of these properties.

sub-optimally by rule based algorithms is addressed in this manuscript. The
task in the puzzle is to rearrange $n^2-1$ pebbles on the square grid of the
size of n x n using one vacant position to a desired goal configuration. An
improvement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and
experimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a
more efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called
snakes and moving them jointly within the snake. An experimental evaluation
showed that the algorithm using snakes produces solutions that are 8% to 9%
shorter than solutions generated by the original algorithm.
  The snake-based relocation has been also integrated into rule-based
algorithms for solving the CPF problem sub-optimally, which is a closely
related task. The task in CPF is to relocate a group of abstract robots that
move over an undirected graph to given goal vertices. Robots can move to
unoccupied neighboring vertices and at most one robot can be placed in each
vertex. The $(n^2-1)$-puzzle is a special case of CPF where the underlying
graph is represented by a 4-connected grid and there is only one vacant vertex.
Two major rule-based algorithms for CPF were included in our study - BIBOX and
PUSH-and-SWAP (PUSH-and-ROTATE). Improvements gained by using snakes in the
BIBOX algorithm were stable around 30% in $(n^2-1)$-puzzle solving and up to
50% in CPFs over bi-connected graphs with various ear decompositions and
multiple vacant vertices. In the case of the PUSH-and-SWAP algorithm the
improvement achieved by snakes was around 5% to 8%. However, the improvement
was unstable and hardly predictable in the case of PUSH-and-SWAP.

Riemann zeta function on the critical line. In 1918 Hardy and Littlewood
established an asymptotic formula for the second moment and in 1926 Ingham

moments have been asymptotically evaluated. In this article we study the sixth
moment of the zeta function on the critical line. We show that a conjectural
formula for a certain family of ternary additive divisor sums implies an
asymptotic formula with power savings error term for the sixth moment of the
Riemann zeta function on the critical line. This provides a rigorous proof for
a heuristic argument of Conrey and Gonek. Furthermore, this gives some evidence
towards a conjecture of Conrey, Keating, Farmer, Rubinstein, and Snaith on
shifted moments of the Riemann zeta function. In addition, this improves on a
theorem of Ivic, who obtained an upper bound for the the sixth moment of the
zeta function, based on the assumption of a conjectural formula for correlation
sums of the triple divisor function.

large reduction in the radius of the H$\alpha$ emission region from $\sim$ 6.9

particle-field system is developed. The connection between space-time symmetry
and energy-momentum conservation laws for the system is established
geometrically without splitting the space and time coordinates, i.e.,
space-time is treated as one identity without choosing a coordinate system. To
achieve this goal, we need to overcome two difficulties. The first difficulty
arises from the fact that particles and field reside on different manifold. As
a result, the geometric Lagrangian density of the system is a function of the
4-potential of electromagnetic fields and also a functional of particles'
world-lines. The other difficulty associated with the geometric setting is due
to the mass-shell condition. The standard Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation for a
particle is generalized into the geometric EL equation when the mass-shell
condition is imposed. For the particle-field system, the geometric EL equation
is further generalized into a weak geometric EL equation for particles. With
the EL equation for field and the geometric weak EL equation for particles,
symmetries and conservation laws can be established geometrically. A geometric
expression for the energy-momentum tensor for particles is derived for the
first time, which recovers the non-geometric form in the existing literature
for a chosen coordinate system.

presented, giving a clear physical explanation of all features in the
extinction spectrum. Counter-intuitively, this can show negative contributions
to extinction, which are shown to arise from the interference between
non-orthogonal modes. The direct and interference contributions to extinction
are determined, showing that conservation of energy is preserved. The Huygens'
condition of matched electric and magnetic dipole moments leads to strong
forward scattering and suppressed back scattering. It is shown that higher

multiple bands of directional scattering. The presented results are obtained
using a robust approach to find the modes of nano-photonic scatterers, commonly

electronic converters and systems for the purpose of stability investigations.
Such models can be divided into either decoupled models or matrix models. A
decoupled impedance model is highly appealing since the
Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result
interpretation very simple. On the other hand, matrix impedance models are more
accurate, and in some cases necessary. Previous works have applied various
approximations to obtain decoupled models, and both the dq- and sequence
domains have been used. This paper introduces the terms decoupled and
semi-decoupled impedance models in order to have a clear classification of the
available approximations.
  The accuracy of 4 decoupled impedance models are discussed based on the
concept of Mirror Frequency Coupling (MFC). By definition the decoupled models
based on sequence domain impedances will be exact for systems without MFC. In
the general case, they are expected to be more accurate than the decoupled
dq-impedance models. The paper defines a norm $\epsilon$ to measure the degree
of coupling in the impedance matrices. This norm equals the error in the
eigenvalue loci between the matrix and semi-decoupled models. This can also be
viewed as the error in the semi-decoupled Nyquist plot.
  An example case study consisting of a grid-connected VSC with current
controller and PLL is used to compare the different methods. It is found that
decoupled and semi-decoupled models in the dq-domain are only applicable in
grids with very low X/R-ratio. Furthermore, it is concluded that the decoupled
model in the sequence domain gives close to equal results as the semi-decoupled
model.

large-scale inhomogeneities, kinetic effects and turbulence. Beside the
homogeneous turbulence, generation of small scale fluctuations can take place
also in other realistic configurations, namely, when perturbations superpose to
an inhomogeneous background magnetic field. When an Alfv\'en wave propagates in
a medium where the Alfv\'en speed varies in a direction transverse to the mean
field, it undergoes phase-mixing, which progressively bends wavefronts,
generating small scales in the transverse direction. As soon as transverse
scales get of the order of the proton inertial length $d_p$, kinetic Alfv\'en
waves (KAWs) are naturally generated. KAWs belong to the branch of Alfv\'en
waves and propagate nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, at
scales close to $d_p$. Many numerical, observational and theoretical works have
suggested that these fluctuations may play a determinant role in the
development of the solar-wind turbulent cascade. In the present paper, the
generation of large amplitude KAW fluctuations in inhomogeneous background and
their effect on the protons have been investigated by means of hybrid
Vlasov-Maxwell direct numerical simulations. Imposing a pressure balanced
magnetic shear, the kinetic dynamics of protons has been investigated by
varying both the magnetic configuration and the amplitude of the initial
perturbations. Of interest here is the transition from quasi-linear to
turbulent regimes, focusing, in particular, on the development of important
non-Maxwellian features in the proton distribution function driven by KAW
fluctuations.

$\mu^{\star}=0.22$ is required to get the critical temperature $T_c = 2.8$~K
consistent with experiment. If such $\mu^{\star}$ is used, the Eliashberg
formalism reproduces also the experimentally observed values of the
superconducting order parameter, the electronic specific heat jump at the
critical temperature, and the change of the London penetration depth with
temperature. This shows, that deviation of the above-mentioned parameters from
the BCS predictions do not prejudge on the triplet or multiple gap nature of
the superconductivity in this compound. Under the external pressure,
calculations predict continuous increase of the electron-phonon coupling
constant in the whole pressure range 0-15~GPa, consistent with the
experimentally observed increase in $T_c$ for the pressure range 0-4~GPa, but
inconsistent with the drop of $T_c$ above 4~GPa and the disappearance of the
superconductivity above 7~GPa, reported experimentally. The disappearance of
superconductivity may be accounted for by increasing the $\mu^{\star}$ to 0.36
at 7~GPa, which supports the hypothesis of the formation of a new high-pressure
electronic phase, which competes with the superconductivity.

The number of exciton states belonging to a particular principal quantum number

leading to optical activation of states that are dark in zero field. As
compared with atoms, due to the reduced Rydberg energy states with different

range. When this occurs, we observe mostly crossing of levels within the

it is well known that classical measurement error of the exposure can reduce
the power of a test of the null hypothesis in question, although its type I
error rate will generally remain at the nominal level. In contrast, classical
measurement error of a confounder can inflate the type I error rate of a test
of treatment effect. In this paper, we develop a large class of semiparametric
test statistics of an exposure causal effect, which are completely robust to
classical measurement error of a subset of confounders. A unique and appealing
feature of our proposed methods is that they require no external information
such as validation data or replicates of error-prone confounders. We present a
doubly-robust form of this test that requires only one of two models to be
correctly specified for the resulting test statistic to have correct type I
error rate. We demonstrate validity and power within our class of test

investigate whether the difference between nitrile and isonitrile functional
groups may induce differences in the adsorption energies of the related isomers
at the surfaces of interstellar grains of different nature and morphologies.
The question was addressed by means of a concerted experimental and theoretical
study of the adsorption energies of CH3CN and CH3NC on the surface water ice
and silica. The experimental determination of the molecule - surface
interaction energies was carried out using temperature programmed desorption
(TPD) under an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) between 70 and 160 K. Theoretically, the
question was addressed using first principle periodic density functional theory
(DFT) to represent the organized solid support. The most stable isomer (CH3CN)
interacts more efficiently with the solid support than the higher energy isomer
(CH3NC) for water ice and silica. Comparing with the HCN and HNC pair of
isomers, the simulations show an opposite behaviour, in which isonitrile HNC
are more strongly adsorbed than nitrile HCN provided that hydrogen bonds are
compatible with the nature of the model surface. The present study confirms
that the strength of the molecule surface interaction between isomers is not
related to their intrinsic stability but instead to their respective ability to
generate different types of hydrogen bonds.

practically relevant situation in which the nonlocal compatibility conditions

negative powers of the viscosity. Taking into account the loss of regularity
suffered by the solution of the Navier--Stokes equations at the initial time in
the absence of nonlocal compatibility conditions of the data, error bounds of

background rotation show the existence of a systematic and significant
imbalance between the non-linear energy cascade to small scales and its
dissipation. By starting the decay from a statistically stationary and fully
developed rotating turbulence state, where the dissipation and the energy flux
are approximately equal, the data shows a growing imbalance between the two
until a maximum is reached when the dissipation is about twice the energy flux.
This dichotomy of behaviours during decay is reminiscent of the non-equilibrium
and the equilibrium regions previously reported for non-rotating turbulence
[P.C. Valente, J.C. Vassilicos, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 108} 214503 (2012)].
Note, however, that for decaying rotating turbulence the classical scaling of
the dissipation rate $\epsilon \propto u'^3/L$ (where $u'$ and $L$ are the root
mean square fluctuating velocity and the integral length scale, respectively)
does not appear to hold during decay, which may be attributed to the effect of
the background rotation on the energy cascade. On the other hand, the maximum
energy flux holds the scaling $\Pi_{max} \propto u'^3/L$ in the initial stage
of the decay until the maximum imbalance is reached.

anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the
k-Means clustering.

p~0.16 in YBCO. In this framework, even the pseudogap temperature T* is
interpreted in terms of a reduction of the density of states due to incipient
CDW and, at lower temperature to the possible formation of incoherent
superconducting pairs. The dynamically fluctuating character of CDW accounts
for the different temperatures at which the pseudogap (T*), the CDW onset
revealed by X-ray scattering (T_{ons}(p)), and the static three-dimensional CDW
ordering appear. We also investigate the anisotropic character of the
CDW-mediated scattering. We find that this is strongly anisotropic only close
to the CDW quantum critical point (QCP) at low temperature and very low energy.
It rapidly becomes nearly isotropic and marginal-Fermi-liquid-like away from
the CDW QCP and at finite (even rather small) energies. This may reconcile the
interpretation of Hall measurements in terms of anisotropic CDW scattering with
recent photoemission experiments.

system is a challenging task that is a crucial step towards precise medical
treatment of many disfunctions and diseases. Although mathematical models
describing the endocrine system as a whole are still elusive, recently some
substantial progress has been made in analyzing theoretically its subsystems
(or axes) that regulate production of specific hormones. Many of the relevant
mathematical models are similar in structure to (or squarely based on) the
celebrated Goodwin's oscillator. Such models are convenient to explain stable
periodic oscillations at hormones' level by representing the corresponding
endocrine regulation circuits as cyclic feedback systems. However, many real
hormonal regulation mechanisms (in particular, testosterone regulation) are in
fact known to have non-cyclic structures and involve multiple feedbacks; a
Goodwin-type model thus represents only a part of such a complicated mechanism.
In this paper, we examine a new mathematical model of hormonal regulation,
obtained from the classical Goodwin's oscillator by introducing an additional
negative feedback. Local stability properties of the proposed model are
studied, and we show that the local instability of its unique equilibrium
implies oscillatory behavior of almost all solutions. Furthermore, under
additional restrictions we prove that almost all solutions converge to periodic
ones.

situation in lower-dimensional systems, we observe in this three-dimensional

observed to scale linearly with the Higgs mass near criticality, indicative of
this critically well-defined excitation mode of the symmetry broken phase.

of the vector vortex coronagraph, where the helical phase ramp is produced by a
concentric subwavelength grating. For several years, we have been manufacturing
AGPMs by etching gratings into synthetic diamond substrates using inductively
coupled plasma etching. Aims. We aim to design, fabricate, optimize, and
evaluate new L-band AGPMs that reach the highest possible coronagraphic
performance, for applications in current and forthcoming infrared high-contrast
imagers. Methods. Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) is used for designing
the subwavelength grating of the phase mask. Coronagraphic performance
evaluation is performed on a dedicated optical test bench. The experimental
results of the performance evaluation are then used to accurately determine the
actual profile of the fabricated gratings, based on RCWA modeling. Results. The
AGPM coronagraphic performance is very sensitive to small errors in etch depth
and grating profile. Most of the fabricated components therefore show moderate
performance in terms of starlight rejection (a few 100:1 in the best cases).
Here we present new processes for re-etching the fabricated components in order
to optimize the parameters of the grating and hence significantly increase
their coronagraphic performance. Starlight rejection up to 1000:1 is
demonstrated in a broadband L filter on the coronagraphic test bench, which
corresponds to a raw contrast of about 1e-5 at two resolution elements from the
star for a perfect input wave front on a circular, unobstructed aperture.
Conclusions. Thanks to their exquisite performance, our latest L-band AGPMs are
good candidates for installation in state-of-the-art and future high-contrast
thermal infrared imagers, such as METIS for the E-ELT.

were used to study the variations of the photometric light curve, the evolution
of the chromospheric activity from the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, and the
distribution of cool spots from Doppler maps.
  During our observations one side of the star was more active than the other.
The equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line from the least active hemisphere
increased from ~0.7 {\AA} at the beginning of the observation to 1.0 {\AA} at
the end. The basal emission of the most active hemisphere remained roughly
constant at a H$\alpha$ EW of ~1.0 {\AA}. Intense flare activity was observed
during the first twenty days, where at least four different events were
detected. The line asymmetries of the H$\alpha$ line suggest that one of the
flares could have produced a mass ejection with a maximum projected speed of
$\mathrm{70\thinspace km\thinspace s^{-1}}$. The rotational modulation of the
V-band photometry showed clear anti-correlation with the chromospheric
activity. The difference in brightness between the opposite hemispheres
decreased from 0.16 to 0.09 mag in two months. Three spots gradually moving
apart from each other dominated the photospheric Doppler maps. The comparison
between the maps and the H$\alpha$ line as the star rotates reveals the spatial
coexistence of chromospheric H$\alpha$ emission and photospheric spots.
  Our results indicate that the active regions of LQ Hya can live for at least
four months. The detected changes in the photometric light curve and the
spectroscopic Doppler images seem to be more a consequence of the spatial
redistribution of the active regions rather than due to changes in their
strength. Only one of the active regions shows significant changes in its
chromospheric emission.

phylogenetic tree for the species containing the genes of interest can be used
to choose among the many possible compatible ""supergenetrees"", the most natural

is then adapted to gene trees with nodes labeled as duplication or speciation,
the additional constraint being to preserve the orthology and paralogy
relations between genes. Then, a quadratic time algorithm is developed for
efficiently correcting an initial gene tree while preserving a set of ""trusted""
subtrees, as well as the relative phylogenetic distance between them, in both

increasing global energy demands; but the extraction technologies are very
expensive. It is therefore important to develop realistic transport modelling
and simulation methods, for porous rocks and porous media, that can compliment
the field work. Here, a new nonlinear transport model for single phase gas flow
in tight porous media is derived, incorporating many important physical
processes that occur in such porous systems: continuous flow, transition flow,
slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, adsorption and desorption in to and out of the
rock material, and a correction for high flow rates (turbulence). This produces
a nonlinear advection-diffusion type of partial differential equation (PDE)
with pressure dependent model parameters and associated compressibility
coefficients, and highly nonlinear apparent convective flux (velocity) and
apparent diffusivity. An important application is to the determination of shale
rock properties, such as porosity and permeability, by history matching of the
the simulation results to data from pressure-pulse decay tests in a shale rock
core sample [Pong K., Ho C., Liu J., Tai Y. Non-linear pressure distribution in
uniform microchannels. ASME Fluids Eng. Div. (FED) Vol. 197, 51--56, (1994)].
The estimates of the rock porosity and the permeability from our model
simulations are realistic of shale rocks, more realistic than obtained from

(SEPs), measured at 1 AU from the Sun, typically increases with the ions'

taking place within the acceleration region. In this paper we study the
propagation through interplanetary space of SEP Fe ions, injected near the Sun
with a variety of charge states that are uniformly distributed in energy, by
means of a 3D test particle model. In our simulations, due to gradient and
curvature drifts associated with the Parker spiral magnetic field, ions of
different charge propagate with very different efficiencies to an observer that
is not magnetically well connected to the source region. As a result we find
that, for many observer locations, the 1 AU event-averaged charge state <Q>, as
obtained from our model, displays an increase with particle energy E, in
qualitative agreement with spacecraft observations. We conclude that
drift-associated propagation is a possible explanation for the observed
distribution of <Q> versus E in SEP events, and that the distribution measured

certain configurations determine whether someone could fall into a sudden

behaviour is rather difficult for large graphs. We describe the dynamics of
networks using one-dimensional discrete time dynamical systems theory obtained
from a mean field approach to (elementary) probabilistic cellular automata
(PCA). Often the mean field approach is used on a regular graph (a grid or
torus) where each node has the same number of edges and the same probability of
becoming active. We show that we can use variations of the mean field of the
grid to describe the dynamics of the PCA on a random and small-world graph.
Bifurcation diagrams for the mean field of the grid, random, and small-world

Extensive simulations indicate for different graph sizes (number of nodes) that
the mean field approximation is accurate. The mean field approach allows us to
provide possible explanations of 'jumping' behaviour in depression.

  With these new results in a disposition, algebraic and rational flows can be
much more easily and transparently classified. It also turns out that the
notion of an algebraic projective flow is a very natural one. For example, we
give an inductive (on dimension) method to build algebraic projective flows
with rational vector fields, and ask whether these account for all such flows.
  Further, we expand on results concerning rational flows in dimension $2$.
Previously we found such flows symmetric with respect to a linear involution
$i(x,y)=(y,x)$. Here we find all rational flows symmetric with respect to a
non-linear $1$-homogeneous involution $i(x,y)=(\frac{y^2}{x},y)$. We also find

Almost twenty years ago Ninomiya defined analogues of van der Corput sequences

relate $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-adic Halton sequences to rotations on high

utilized to calculate the quasiprobability distributions such as the
Sudarshan-Glauber diagonal P -representation, the Wigner W -distribution, and
the nonnegative Husimi Q-function. The negativity associated with the W
-distribution acts as a measure of the nonclassicality of the state. The
existence of the multiple time scales induced by the interaction introduces
certain features in the bipartite system. In the strong coupling regime the
transient evolution to low entropy configurations reveals brief emergence of
nearly pure kitten states that may be regarded as superposition of uniformly
separated distinguishable squeezed coherent states. However, the quantum
fluctuations with a short time period engender bifurcation and subsequent
rejoining of these peaks in the phase space. The abovementioned doubling of the
number of peaks increases the entropy to its near maximal value. Nonetheless,
these states characterized by high entropy values, are endowed with a large
negativity of the W -distribution that points towards their non-Gaussian
behavior. This may be ascertained by the significantly large Hilbert-Schmidt
distance between the oscillator state and an ensemble of most general
statistical mixture of squeezed Gaussian states possessing nearly identical

processing engines, enabling effective key-value tuple distribution over worker
threads in a logical operator. While randomized hashing on the keys is capable
of balancing the workload for key-based partitioning when the keys generally
follow a static distribution, it is likely to generate poor balancing
performance when workload variance occurs on the incoming data stream. This
paper presents a new key-based workload partitioning framework, with practical
algorithms to support dynamic workload assignment for stateful operators. The
framework combines hash-based and explicit key-based routing strategies for
workload distribution, which specifies the destination worker threads for a
handful of keys and assigns the other keys with the hashing function. When
short-term distribution fluctuations occur to the incoming data stream, the
system adaptively updates the routing table containing the chosen keys, in
order to rebalance the workload with minimal migration overhead within the
stateful operator. We formulate the rebalance operation as an optimization
problem, with multiple objectives on minimizing state migration costs,
controlling the size of the routing table and breaking workload imbalance among
worker threads. Despite of the NP-hardness nature behind the optimization
formulation, we carefully investigate and justify the heuristics behind key
(re)routing and state migration, to facilitate fast response to workload
variance with ignorable cost to the normal processing in the distributed
system. Empirical studies on synthetic data and real-world stream applications
validate the usefulness of our proposals and prove the huge advantage of our
approaches over state-of-the-art solutions in the literature.

quantum many-body systems starting from a microscopic theory of the system-bath

chain connected to two baths at the first and last site, kept at different
temperatures and chemical potentials. We then shown that, even though the bath
coupling is local, the effective Lindblad dissipator stemming from this
interaction is inherently non-local, affecting all normal modes of the system.
We then use this formalism to study the current of particles and energy through
the system and find that they have the structure of Landauer's formula, with
the bath spectral density playing the role of the transfer integral. Finally,
we consider infinitesimal temperature and chemical potential gradients and show
that the currents satisfy Onsager's reciprocal relations, which is a
consequence of the fact that the microscopic quantum dynamics obeys detailed

optical cavity through fiber stretching and polarization control, the spacing
of the comb lines increases from 0.136 nm to 0.144 nm, and this small change in
mode spacing generates very different spectral symmetry-breaking in the
frequency comb relative to the frequency comb of mode spacing 0.136 nm.
Interestingly, non-uniform depletion of primary modes is also observed. The
experimental results are an important contribution in the continuing effort of
understanding the dynamics of frequency combs involving large number of modes,
nontrivial nonlinear waves and deterministic chaos.

cannot yet be resolved neither in the optical nor in the infrared and it is
fair to say that we still lack a satisfactory understanding of the physical
processes, geometry and composition of the central (sub-parsec) components of
AGN. Like spectral or polarimetric observations, the reverberation data needs
to be modeled in order to infer constraints on the AGN geometry (such as the
inner radius or the half-opening angle of the dusty torus). In this research
note, we present preliminary modeling results using a time-dependent Monte
Carlo method to solve the radiative transfer in a simplified AGN set up. We
investigate different model configurations using both polarization and time
lags and find a high dependency on the geometry to the time-lag response. For
all models there is a clear distinction between edge-on or face-on viewing
angles for fluxes and time lags, the later showing a higher
wavelength-dependence than the former. Time lags, polarization and fluxes point
toward a clear dichotomy between the different inclinations of AGN, a method

NMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; Tu

conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields
adequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the
advantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose
to incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each
decoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based
on the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation
and attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT
recommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with
NMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture
in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation
show that the proposed approach achieves significant and consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art NMT and SMT systems on multiple NIST test

optical mode field, which in turn modulates the atom-photon coupling rate. In
properly designed multimode optomechanical systems, we can achieve situations
in which mode field coupling is the only possible interaction pathway for the
system. This enables, for example, swapping of a single excitation between
emitter and phonon, creation of nonclassical states of motion and mechanical
ground-state cooling in the bad-cavity regime. Importantly, the emitter-phonon
coupling rate can be enhanced through an optical drive field, allowing active
control of strong atom-phonon coupling for realistic experimental parameters.

  Perfect Matching with Delays",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of online Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays
(MPMD) recently introduced by Emek et al, (STOC 2016). This problem is defined
on an underlying $n$-point metric space. An adversary presents real-time
requests online at points of the metric space, and the algorithm is required to
match them, possibly after keeping them waiting for some time. The cost
incurred is the sum of the distances between matched pairs of points (the
connection cost), and the sum of the waiting times of the requests (the delay
cost). We present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$, which
improves the upper bound of $O(\log^2n+\log\Delta)$ of Emek et al, by removing
the dependence on $\Delta$, the aspect ratio of the metric space (which can be
unbounded as a function of $n$). The core of our algorithm is a deterministic
algorithm for MPMD on metrics induced by edge-weighted trees of height $h$,
whose cost is guaranteed to be at most $O(1)$ times the connection cost plus
$O(h)$ times the delay cost of every feasible solution. The reduction from MPMD
on arbitrary metrics to MPMD on trees is achieved using the result on embedding
$n$-point metric spaces into distributions over weighted hierarchically
separated trees of height $O(\log n)$, with distortion $O(\log n)$. We also
prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ on the competitive ratio of any
randomized algorithm. This is the first lower bound which increases with $n$,
and is attained on the metric of $n$ equally spaced points on a line.
  The problem of Min-cost Bipartite Perfect Matching with Delays (MBPMD) is the
same as MPMD except that every request is either positive or negative, and
requests can be matched only if they have opposite polarity. We prove an upper
bound of $O(\log n)$ and a lower bound of $\Omega(\log^{1/3}n)$ on the
competitive ratio of MBPMD with a more involved analysis.

the plasma beta, distributed over three orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 10.
In all the cases, once turbulence is fully developed, we observe a power-law
spectrum of the fluctuating magnetic field on large scales (in the inertial
range) with a spectral index close to -5/3, while in the sub-ion range we
observe another power-law spectrum with a spectral index systematically varying
with $\beta$ (from around -3.6 for small values to around -2.9 for large ones).
The two ranges are separated by a spectral break around ion scales. The length
scale at which this transition occurs is found to be proportional to the ion
inertial length, $d_i$, for $\beta \ll 1$ and to the ion gyroradius, $\rho_i =
d_i\sqrt{\beta}$, for $\beta \gg 1$, i.e., to the larger between the two scales
in both the extreme regimes. For intermediate cases, i.e., $\beta \sim 1$, a
combination of the two scales is involved. We infer an empiric relation for the
dependency of the spectral break on $\beta$ that provides a good fit over the
whole range of values. We compare our results with in situ observations in the
solar wind and suggest possible explanations for such a behavior.

We consider models with $128^3$, $256^3$, $512^3$ and $1024^3$ zones. The
turbulent flow properties of these carbon burning simulations are very similar
to the oxygen burning case. We performed a mean field analysis of the kinetic
energy budgets within the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes framework. For the
upper convective boundary region, we find that the numerical dissipation is
insensitive to resolution for linear mesh resolutions above 512 grid points.
For the stiffer, more stratified lower boundary, our highest resolution model
still shows signs of decreasing sub-grid dissipation suggesting it is not yet
numerically converged. We find that the widths of the upper and lower
boundaries are roughly 30% and 10% of the local pressure scale heights,
respectively. The shape of the boundaries is significantly different from those
used in stellar evolution models. As in past oxygen-shell burning simulations,
we observe entrainment at both boundaries in our carbon-shell burning
simulations. In the large P\'eclet number regime found in the advanced phases,
the entrainment rate is roughly inversely proportional to the bulk Richardson
number, Ri$_{\rm B}$ ($\propto $Ri${\rm_B}^{-\alpha}$, $0.5\lesssim \alpha

tactics in interactive theorem provers, often provides short, concise and
elegant implementations. Whilst being elegant, the use of higher order features
and combinator languages often results in a very procedural view of a strategy,
which may deviate significantly from the high-level ideas behind it. This can
make a tactic hard to understand and hence difficult to to debug and maintain
for experts and non-experts alike: one often has to tear apart complex
combinations of lower level tactics manually in order to analyse a failure in
the overall strategy. In an industrial technology transfer project, we have
been working on porting a very large and complex proof tactic into PSGraph, a
graphical language for representing proof strategies, supported by the Tinker
tool. The goal of this work is to improve understandability and maintainability
of tactics. Motivated by some initial successes with this, we here extend
PSGraph with additional features for development and debugging. Through the
re-implementation and refactoring of several existing tactics, we demonstrates
the advantages of PSGraph compared with a typical linear (term-based) tactic
language with respect to debugging, readability and maintenance. In order to
act as guidance for others, we give a fairly detailed comparison of the user
experience with the two approaches. The paper is supported by a web page

Einstein gravity is uncovered. Noether's 1918 paper developed Hilbert's and
Klein's reflections on the conservation laws. Energy-momentum is just a term
proportional to the field equations and a 'curl' term with identically zero
divergence. Noether proved a \emph{converse} ""Hilbertian assertion"": such
""improper"" conservation laws imply a generally covariant action.
  Later and independently, particle physicists derived the nonlinear Einstein
equations assuming the absence of negative-energy degrees of freedom (""ghosts"")
for stability, along with universal coupling: all energy-momentum including
gravity's serves as a source for gravity. Those assumptions (all but) imply
(for 0 graviton mass) that the energy-momentum is only a term proportional to
the field equations and a symmetric ""curl,"" which implies the coalescence of
the flat background geometry and the gravitational potential into an effective
curved geometry. The flat metric, though useful in Rosenfeld's stress-energy
definition, disappears from the field equations. Thus the particle physics
derivation uses a reinvented Noetherian converse Hilbertian assertion in
Rosenfeld-tinged form.
  The Rosenfeld stress-energy is identically the canonical stress-energy plus a
Belinfante curl and terms proportional to the field equations, so the flat
metric is only a convenient mathematical trick without ontological commitment.
Neither generalized relativity of motion, nor the identity of gravity and
inertia, nor substantive general covariance is assumed. The more compelling
criterion of lacking ghosts yields substantive general covariance as an output.
Hence the particle physics derivation, though logically impressive, is neither
as novel nor as ontologically laden as it has seemed.
