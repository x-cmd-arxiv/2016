show quite a special and unexpected behaviour of the proportion of elastic
scattering compared to inelastic processes with increasing energy. It decreases
at the beginning (at comparatively low energies) but then starts increasing.
From Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) energies of 23.5 - 62.5 GeV up to higher
energies 7 - 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it increases by a factor
more than 1.5! According to intuitive classical ideas we would expect a stable
tendency with increasing proportion of the break-down of protons compared to
their survival probability. One can assume that either the asymptotic freedom
or the extremely short time of flight of high energy protons through each other
are in charge of such a surprising effect. The unquestionable principle of
unitarity combined with the available experimental data on elastic scattering
is used to get new conclusions about the shape of the interaction region of
colliding protons. Its evolution at present energies is considered. Some
predictions about its behaviour at even higher energies are described with
different assumptions on relative roles of elastic scattering and inelastic
processes. The shape can transform rather drastically if the proportion of
elastic processes keeps rising. This unexpected property leads to an unexpected
corollary. The possible origin of the effect and its interrelation to the
strong interaction dynamics are speculated.

for many computer vision tasks, it has failed so far to bring similar
improvements to instance-level image retrieval. In this article, we argue that
reasons for the underwhelming results of deep methods on image retrieval are
threefold: i) noisy training data, ii) inappropriate deep architecture, and
iii) suboptimal training procedure. We address all three issues.
  First, we leverage a large-scale but noisy landmark dataset and develop an
automatic cleaning method that produces a suitable training set for deep
retrieval. Second, we build on the recent R-MAC descriptor, show that it can be
interpreted as a deep and differentiable architecture, and present improvements
to enhance it. Last, we train this network with a siamese architecture that
combines three streams with a triplet loss. At the end of the training process,
the proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single
forward pass that is well suited for image retrieval. Extensive experiments
show that our approach significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches,
including state-of-the-art methods based on costly local descriptor indexing
and spatial verification. On Oxford 5k, Paris 6k and Holidays, we respectively
report 94.7, 96.6, and 94.8 mean average precision. Our representations can
also be heavily compressed using product quantization with little loss in
accuracy. For additional material, please see

the AGN torus, but is predominantly linked to dust at kpc-scales heated by the

method to manage a large number of users and an efficient key revocation method

IBE (RHIBE) can provide these two methods by organizing the identities of users

inherent limitation such that the number of update key elements depends on the
number of revoked users.
  In this paper, we propose two new RHIBE schemes in multilinear maps that use
the public-key broadcast encryption scheme instead of using the tree-based
revocation scheme to overcome the mentioned limitation. In our first RHIBE
scheme, the number of private key elements and update key elements is reduced
to $O(\ell)$ and $O(\ell)$ respectively where $\ell$ is the depth of a
hierarchical identity. In our second RHIBE scheme, we can further reduce the

X-rays at the tops of the flare's loops. This was analyzed in previous work
(Longcope et al. 2010), and interpreted as plasma heated and compressed by slow
magnetosonic shocks generated during post-reconnection retraction of the flux.
That work used analytic expressions from a thin flux tube (TFT) model, which
neglected many potentially important factors such as thermal conduction and
chromospheric evaporation. Here we use a numerical solution of the TFT
equations to produce a more comprehensive and accurate model of the same flare,
including those effects previously omitted. These simulations corroborate the
prior hypothesis that slow mode shocks persist well after the retraction has
ended, thus producing a compact, loop-top source instead of an elongated jet,
as steady reconnection models predict. Thermal conduction leads to densities
higher than analytic estimates had predicted, and evaporation enhances the
density still higher, but at lower temperatures. X-ray light curves and spectra
are synthesized by convolving the results from a single TFT simulation with the
rate at which flux is reconnected, as measured through motion of flare ribbons,
for example. These agree well with light curves observed by RHESSI and GOES and
spectra from RHESSI. An image created from a superposition of TFT model runs
resembles one produced from RHESSI observations. This suggests that the HXR
loop-top source, at least the one observed in this flare, could be the result
of slow magnetosonic shocks produced in fast reconnection models like
Petschek's.

fundamental difference between processes driven by a fixed thermodynamic force

driven system with a deterministic protocol to one subject to an external

Using the SW proton density and speed measured by the Solar Wind Around Pluto

we find too few SW minor ions flowing into the 11 x 11 pixel box centered on
Pluto than are needed to support the observed emission rate unless the SW is

various observables have been proposed in heavy ion collisions to access this
physics. Recently the CMS Collaboration \cite{Khachatryan:2016got} has reported
results from p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV on one such observable, the
three-point correlator. The results are strikingly similar to those measured at
the same particle multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions, which have been attributed
to the CME. This similarity, combined with two key assumptions about the
magnetic field in p+Pb collisions, presents a major challenge to the CME
picture. These two assumptions as stated in the CMS paper are (1) that the
magnetic field in p+Pb collisions is smaller than that in Pb+Pb collisions and
(2) that the magnetic field direction is uncorrelated with the flow angle. We
test these two postulates in the Monte Carlo Glauber framework and find that
the magnetic fields are not significantly smaller in central p+Pb collisions,
however the magnetic field direction and the flow angle are indeed
uncorrelated. The second finding alone gives strong evidence that the
three-point correlator signal in Pb+Pb and p+Pb is not an indication of the
CME. Similar measurements in d+Au over a range of energies accessible at RHIC
would be elucidating. In the same calculational framework, we find that even in
Pb+Pb collisions, where the magnetic field direction and the flow angle are
correlated, there exist large inhomogeneities that are on the size scale of
topological domains. These inhomogeneities need to be incorporated in any
detailed CME calculation.

The emission is soft for both stars, kTApec = 0.30 to 0.50 keV, suggesting
X-rays produced by stellar rotation and/or convection in young dynamos, but not
accretion or outflow shocks which we rule out. A possible 2.8 +/- 0.15

low confidence and of unknown provenance. Stellar wind drag models

to active noise are studied theoretically. The noise may originate from the
interaction of the polymer with surround- ing active (Brownian) particles or
from the inherent motion of the polymer itself, which may be composed of active
Brownian particles. In the latter case, the respective monomers are indepen-
dently propelled in directions changing diffusively. For the description of the
polymer, we adopt the continuous Gaussian semiflexible polymer model.
Specifically, the finite polymer extensibility is taken into account which
turns out to be essentially for the polymer conformations. Our analytical
calculations predict a strong dependence of the relaxation times on the
activity. In particular, semi- flexible polymers exhibit a crossover from a
bending-elasticity-dominated to the flexible-polymer dynamics with increasing
activity. This leads to a significant noise-induced polymer shrinkage over a
large range of self-propulsion velocities. For large activities, the polymers
swell and their extension becomes comparable to the contour length. The scaling
properties of the mean square end-to-end distance with respect to the polymer
length and monomer activity are discussed.

freedom, thanks to the existence of constraints. We discuss a geometrical
approach to degenerate scalar-tensor systems, and analyse its consequences. We
show that some of these theories emerge as a certain limit of DBI Galileons. In
absence of dynamical gravity, these systems correspond to scalar theories
enjoying a symmetry which is different from Galileon invariance. The scalar
theories have however problems concerning the propagation of fluctuations
around a time dependent background. These issues can be tamed by breaking the
symmetry by hand, or by minimally coupling the scalar with dynamical gravity in
a way that leads to degenerate scalar-tensor systems. We show that distinct
theories can be connected by a relation which generalizes Galileon duality, in
certain cases also when gravity is dynamical. We discuss some implications of
our results in concrete examples. Our findings can be helpful for assessing
stability properties and understanding the non-perturbative structure of

process and use it to conduct an economic evaluation of the double-spend
attack, which is fundamental to all blockchain systems. Our analysis focuses on
the value of transactions that can be secured under a conventional double-spend
attack, both with and without a concurrent eclipse attack. Our model quantifies
the importance of several factors that determine the attack's success,
including confirmation depth, attacker mining power, and any confirmation
deadline set by the merchant. In general, the security of a transaction against
a double-spend attack increases roughly logarithmically with the depth of the
block, made easier by the increasing sum of coin turned-over (between
individuals) in the blocks, but more difficult by the increasing proof of work
required. In recent blockchain data, we observed a median block turnover value
of 6 BTC. Based on this value, a merchant requiring a single confirmation is
protected against only attackers that can increase the current mining power by
1% or less. However, similar analysis shows that a merchant that requires a
much longer 72 confirmations (~12 hours) will eliminate all potential profit
for any double-spend attacker adding mining power less than 40% of the current
mining power.

wide-ranging as climatology, social communication and network science. In
neuroscience, perfectly consistent repetitions of the same global propagation
pattern are called a synfire pattern. For any recording of sequences of
discrete events (in neuroscience terminology: sets of spike trains) the
questions arise how closely it resembles such a synfire pattern and which are
the spike trains that lead/follow. Here we address these questions and
introduce an algorithm built on two new indicators, termed SPIKE-Order and
Spike Train Order, that define the Synfire Indicator value, which allows to
sort multiple spike trains from leader to follower and to quantify the
consistency of the temporal leader-follower relationships for both the original
and the optimized sorting. We demonstrate our new approach using artificially
generated datasets before we apply it to analyze the consistency of propagation
patterns in two real datasets from neuroscience (Giant Depolarized Potentials
in mice slices) and climatology (El Ni~no sea surface temperature recordings).
The new algorithm is distinguished by conceptual and practical simplicity, low
computational cost, as well as flexibility and universality.

cycles in the preferential attachment model. In this model, vertices are added
to the graph one by one, and each time a new vertex is created it establishes a
connection with $m$ random vertices selected with probabilities proportional to
their current degrees. (Constant $m$ is the only parameter of the model.) We
prove that if $m \ge 1{,}260$, then asymptotically almost surely there exists a
perfect matching. Moreover, we show that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle
asymptotically almost surely, provided that $m \ge 29{,}500$. One difficulty in
the analysis comes from the fact that vertices establish connections only with
vertices that are ""older"" (i.e. are created earlier in the process). However,
the main obstacle arises from the fact that edges in the preferential
attachment model are not generated independently. In view of that, we also
consider a simpler setting---sometimes called uniform attachment---in which
vertices are added one by one and each vertex connects to $m$ older vertices
selected uniformly at random and independently of all other choices. We first
investigate the existence of perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles in the
uniform attachment model, and then extend the argument to the preferential
attachment version.

this suite of elements we determine that the parent body being accreted by

that it is rocky and iron-poor. Combining this with comparison to other heavily

with a model where a significant amount of the accreted rocky minerals took the

to understand and control spin currents in graphene by the magnetic exchange
field of a nearby ferromagnetic material in graphene/ferromagnetic-insulator

strong modulation of spin currents in graphene layers by controlling the
direction of the exchange field due to FMI magnetization. Owing to clean
interfaces, a strong magnetic exchange coupling leads to the experimental
observation of complete spin modulation at low externally applied magnetic
fields in short graphene channels. Additionally, we discover that the graphene
spin current can be fully dephased by randomly fluctuating exchange fields.
This is manifested as an unusually strong temperature dependence of the
non-local spin signals in graphene, which is due to spin relaxation by
thermally-induced transverse fluctuations of the FMI magnetization.

harmonic emission. Since both metals and dielectrics exhibit nonlinearity, the
nonlinear far-field contains contributions from each, and the impossibility of
measuring these contributions separately has led to seemingly contradictory
interpretations about the origin of the nonlinear emission. We determine that
the origin of the third harmonic from metal-dielectric dipole nanoantennas
depends on nanoantenna design, and in particular, the width. We find that the
emission from gold dominates in thin threadlike nanoantennas, whereas the
emission from the gap material dominates in wider nanoantennas. We also find
that monopole nanoantennas perform better than dipoles having the same width,
and due to their simplicity should be preferred in many applications.

order to translate pairwise kSZ measurements into cosmological constraints,
external constraints on $\tau$ are necessary. In this work, we present a new

computationally efficient and can reproduce results of recent hydrodynamical

constrained to better than 6% (with a confidence level of 95%), which sets the
tightest constraints on the external prior on the optical depth of groups and

scales, and for isolated astrophysical systems, using the perturbative
framework known as the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. This
framework is designed for use in the weak-field and slow-motion limit of
gravity, and can be used to constrain a large class of metric theories of
gravity with data collected from the aforementioned systems. Given the
potential of future surveys to probe cosmological scales to high precision, it
is a topic of much contemporary interest to construct a similar framework to
link Einstein's theory of gravity and its alternatives to observations on
cosmological scales. Our approach to this problem is to adapt and extend the
existing PPN formalism for use in cosmology. We derive a set of equations that
use the same parameters to consistently model both weak fields and cosmology.
This allows us to parameterize a large class of modified theories of gravity
and dark energy models on cosmological scales, using just four functions of
time. These four functions can be directly linked to the background expansion
of the universe, first-order cosmological perturbations, and the weak-field
limit of the theory. They also reduce to the standard PPN parameters on solar
system scales. We illustrate how dark energy models and scalar-tensor and
vector-tensor theories of gravity fit into this framework, which we refer to as
""parameterized post-Newtonian cosmology"" (PPNC).

propelling a nano-scale spacecraft by the radiation pressure of an intense

speed, it could reach the vicinity of our nearest potentially habitable
exoplanet within our life time and capture its images and obtain other
scientific data. In this project the nanocraft is a gram-scale robotic
spacecraft comprising two main parts: StarChip and Lightsail.
  To achieve the goal of the project it is necessary to solve a number of
outstanding scientific problems. One of these tasks is to make sure that the
nanocraft position and orientation inside the intense laser beam column is
stable. The nanocraft driven by intense laser beam pressure acting on its
Lightsail is sensitive to the torques and lateral forces reacting on the
surface of the sail. These forces influence the orientation and lateral
displacement of the spacecraft, thus affecting its dynamics. If unstable the
nanocraft might be expelled from the area of laser beam. In choosing the models
for nanocraft stability studies we are using several assumptions: 1.
configuration of nanocraft is treated as rigid body (applicability of Euler
equations); 2. flat or concave shape of circular sail; 3. mirror reflection of
laser beam from surface of the Lightsail. We found conditions of position
stability for spherical and conical shape of the sail. The simplest stable
configurations require the StarChip to be removed from the sail to make the
distance to the center of mass of nanocraft bigger than curvature radius of the
sail. Stability criteria do not require the spinning of the nanocraft. A flat
sail is never stable (even with spinning).

relationship between the Type IIP and Type IIL subclasses. Whether they come
from distinct progenitors or they are from similar stars with some property
that smoothly transitions from one class to another has been the subject of
much debate. Here we show using one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic SN
models that the multi-band light curves of SNe IIL are well fit by ordinary red
supergiants surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM). The inferred
extent of this material, coupled with a typical wind velocity of ~10-100 km/s,
suggests enhanced activity by these stars during the last ~months to ~years of
their lives, which may be connected with advanced stages of nuclear burning.
Furthermore, we find that even for more plateau-like SNe that dense CSM
provides a better fit to the first ~20 days of their light curves, indicating
that the presence of such material may be more widespread than previously
appreciated. Here we choose to model the CSM with a wind-like density profile,
but it is unclear whether this just generally represents some other mass
distribution, such as a recent mass ejection, thick disk, or even inflated
envelope material. Better understanding the exact geometry and density
distribution of this material will be an important question for future studies.

here a new method to obtain upper limits on Gamma_0. The early high-energy
synchrotron afterglow flux depends strongly on Gamma_0. Upper limits on GeV
emission therefore provide uppers limit on Gamma_0. Applying this method to 190
Fermi GRBs that have not been detected by the Fermi-LAT we place upper limits
on the high-energy afterglow flux, and in turn on Gamma_0. For bursts at a
typical redshift z=2, we find values of the order of 200 (and above) for a
homogeneous density medium, and in the range 100-400 for a wind-like medium.
These upper limits are consistent with (and are very close to) lower limits and
direct estimates inferred using other methods, suggesting that the typical

advances in the controlled manipulation of isolated many-body systems have
enabled detailed studies of non-equilibrium phases in strongly interacting

result in exotic ""time-crystalline"" phases, which spontaneously break the

Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly
lensed by the cluster MACSJ0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its
rest-frame UV, optical, FIR, millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO
emission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift,
the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming
galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8x10^9
Msun, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8x10^11 Lsun. We find that the bulk of
the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from
the rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is
undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust,
but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron
radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J
transitions, at least up to J=6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO
spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm
galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower.
This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We
find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance
when estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The inferred depletion time of
the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion
timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted
by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as
high as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas
fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed
between z~1.5 and z~2.5.

number of measurements that are sampled from orbits of a certain matrix group.
As a special case, our theory makes statements about the phase retrieval
problem. Here, the task is to recover a vector given only the amplitudes of its
inner product with a small number of vectors from an orbit. Variants of the
group in question have appeared under different names in many areas of
mathematics. In coding theory and quantum information, it is the complex
Clifford group; in time-frequency analysis the oscillator group; and in
mathematical physics the metaplectic group. It affords one particularly small
and highly structured orbit that includes and generalizes the discrete Fourier
basis: While the Fourier vectors have coefficients of constant modulus and
phases that depend linearly on their index, the vectors in said orbit have
phases with a quadratic dependence. In quantum information, the orbit is used
extensively and is known as the set of stabilizer states. We argue that due to
their rich geometric structure and their near-optimal recovery properties,
stabilizer states form an ideal model for structured measurements for phase
retrieval. Our results hold for $m\geq C \kappa_r r d \log(d)$ measurements,
where the oversampling factor k varies between $\kappa_r=1$ and $\kappa_r =
r^2$ depending on the orbit. The reconstruction is stable towards both additive
noise and deviations from the assumption of low rank. If the matrices of
interest are in addition positive semidefinite, reconstruction may be performed
by a simple constrained least squares regression. Our proof methods could be
adapted to cover orbits of other groups.

statistical methods become more and more important in order to infer
fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and age. Bayesian techniques are
powerful methods because they can match all available observables
simultaneously to stellar models while taking prior knowledge properly into
account. However, in most cases it is assumed that observables are uncorrelated
which is generally not the case. Here, we include correlations in the Bayesian
code BONNSAI by incorporating the covariance matrix in the likelihood function.
We derive a parametrisation of the covariance matrix that, in addition to
classical uncertainties, only requires the specification of a correlation
parameter that describes how observables co-vary. Our correlation parameter
depends purely on the method with which observables have been determined and
can be analytically derived in some cases. This approach therefore has the
advantage that correlations can be accounted for even if information for them
are not available in specific cases but are known in general. Because the new
likelihood model is a better approximation of the data, the reliability and
robustness of the inferred parameters are improved. We find that neglecting
correlations biases the most likely values of inferred stellar parameters and
affects the precision with which these parameters can be determined. For
example, we apply our technique to massive OB stars, but emphasise that it is
valid for any type of stars. For effective temperatures and surface gravities
determined from atmosphere modelling, we find that masses can be underestimated
on average by $0.5\sigma$ and mass uncertainties overestimated by a factor of
about 2 when neglecting correlations. At the same time, the age precisions are
underestimated over a wide range of stellar parameters. [abridged]

computer models in high stakes settings-- such as sentencing, hiring, policing,

computers. It is argued that because computer models do not hold personal
prejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from prejudice.
There is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not remove the
potential for bias, and can even amplify it, since training data were
inevitably generated by a process that is itself biased. In this paper, we
provide a probabilistic definition of algorithmic bias. We propose a method to
remove bias from predictive models by removing all information regarding
protected variables from the permitted training data. Unlike previous work in
this area, our framework is general enough to accommodate arbitrary data types,
e.g. binary, continuous, etc. Motivated by models currently in use in the
criminal justice system that inform decisions on pre-trial release and
paroling, we apply our proposed method to a dataset on the criminal histories
of individuals at the time of sentencing to produce ""race-neutral"" predictions
of re-arrest. In the process, we demonstrate that the most common approach to
creating ""race-neutral"" models-- omitting race as a covariate-- still results

relations with a language network and then use the network to induce contextual

introduced to exploit the information in the network. Our first approach
retrofits (already trained) Sen2Vec vectors with respect to the network in two
different ways: (1) using the adjacency relations of a node, and (2) using a
stochastic sampling method which is more flexible in sampling neighbors of a
node. The second approach uses a regularizer to encode the information in the
network into the existing Sen2Vec model. Experimental results show that our
proposed models outperform existing methods in three fundamental information

leverage the computational power of multi-core CPUs to achieve fine-grained

energy from the experimental data which relies solely on the two asymptotic
tangents of each dispersion curve, away from the feature itself. It is thereby
insensitive to the different shapes of the kinks as seen in experiments. The

discuss two alternate theoretical explanations of the origin of the kinks. Some
theoretical proposals invoke local Bosonic excitations (Einstein phonons or
other modes with spin or charge character), located exactly at the energy of
observed kinks, leading to a momentum independent self energy of the electrons.
A recent alternate is the theory of extremely correlated Fermi liquids (ECFL).
This theory predicts kinks in the dispersion arising from a momentum dependent
self energy of correlated electrons. We present the essential results from both

distinguish between the two mechanisms. The ECFL theory is found to be

ultraviolet completion of scenarios in which the Higgs particle is a low-energy
remnant of some high-energy dynamics, enjoying a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson
ancestry. Varying the $\sigma$ mass allows to sweep from the perturbative
regime to the customary non-linear implementations. The low-energy benchmark
effective non-linear Lagrangian for bosons and fermions is obtained,
determining as well the operator coefficients including linear corrections. At
first order in the latter, three effective bosonic operators emerge which are
independent of the explicit soft breaking assumed. The Higgs couplings to
vector bosons and fermions turn out to be quite universal: the linear
corrections are proportional to the explicit symmetry breaking parameters.
Furthermore, we define an effective Yukawa operator which allows a simple
parametrization and comparison of different heavy fermion ultraviolet
completions. In addition, one particular fermionic completion is explored in
detail, obtaining the corresponding leading low-energy fermionic operators.

opinions and experiences of different people, and play a critical role in
helping users discover products that match their personal needs and
preferences. To help address questions that can't easily be answered by reading
others' reviews, some review websites also allow users to pose questions to the
community via a question-answering (QA) system. As one would expect, just as
opinions diverge among different reviewers, answers to such questions may also
be subjective, opinionated, and divergent. This means that answering such
questions automatically is quite different from traditional QA tasks, where it
is assumed that a single `correct' answer is available. While recent work
introduced the idea of question-answering using product reviews, it did not
account for two aspects that we consider in this paper: (1) Questions have
multiple, often divergent, answers, and this full spectrum of answers should
somehow be used to train the system; and (2) What makes a `good' answer depends
on the asker and the answerer, and these factors should be incorporated in
order for the system to be more personalized. Here we build a new QA dataset
with 800 thousand questions---and over 3.1 million answers---and show that
explicitly accounting for personalization and ambiguity leads both to
quantitatively better answers, but also a more nuanced view of the range of

coverage problems-- have been studied extensively in streaming models. However,
previous research not only achieve sub-optimal approximation factors and space
complexities, but also study a restricted set arrival model which makes an
explicit or implicit assumption on oracle access to the sets, ignoring the
complexity of reading and storing the whole set at once. In this paper, we
address the above shortcomings, and present algorithms with improved
approximation factor and improved space complexity, and prove that our results
are almost tight. Moreover, unlike most of previous work, our results hold on a
more general edge arrival model. More specifically, we present (almost) optimal
approximation algorithms for maximum coverage and minimum set cover problems in
the streaming model with an (almost) optimal space complexity of
$\tilde{O}(n)$, i.e., the space is {\em independent of the size of the sets or
the size of the ground set of elements}. These results not only improve over
the best known algorithms for the set arrival model, but also are the first
such algorithms for the more powerful {\em edge arrival} model. In order to
achieve the above results, we introduce a new general sketching technique for
coverage functions: This sketching scheme can be applied to convert an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for a coverage problem to a
$(1-\eps)\alpha$-approximation algorithm for the same problem in streaming, or
RAM models. We show the significance of our sketching technique by ruling out
the possibility of solving coverage problems via accessing (as a black box) a
$(1 \pm \eps)$-approximate oracle (e.g., a sketch function) that estimates the
coverage function on any subfamily of the sets.

addition of isospin-triplet scalar fields in such a way as to preserve the
custodial symmetry. The presence of higher-isospin scalars contributing to
electroweak symmetry breaking offers the interesting possibility that the
couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to both gluons and vector boson pairs
could be larger than those of the Standard Model Higgs boson. Constraining this
possibility using measurements of Higgs production and decay at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider is notoriously problematic if a new, non-Standard Model decay
mode of the 125 GeV Higgs boson is present. We study an implementation of this
scenario in which the Georgi-Machacek model is extended by a real singlet
scalar dark matter candidate, and require that the singlet scalar account for
all the dark matter in the universe. The combination of the observed dark
matter relic density and direct detection constraints exclude singlet scalar
masses below about 57 GeV. Higgs measurements are not yet precise enough to be
very sensitive to $h\rightarrow SS$ in the remaining allowed kinematic region,
so that constraints from Higgs measurements are so far the same as in the GM
model without a singlet scalar. We also find that, above the Higgs pole, a
substantial region of parameter space yielding the correct dark matter relic
density can escape the near-future direct detection experiments DEAP and
XENON~1T for dark matter masses as low as 120 GeV and even have a direct
detection cross section below the neutrino floor for $m_S\gtrsim 150$ GeV. This
is in contrast to the singlet scalar dark matter extension of the Standard
Model, for which these future experiments are expected to exclude dark matter
masses above the Higgs pole up to the multi-TeV range.

impact of Pok\'emon Go on people's mobility patterns in a city is still largely
unknown. In this paper, we perform a natural experiment using data from mobile

the floating population of Santiago compared to movement prior to the game's
release in August 2016: in the following week, up to 13.8\% more people spent
time outside at certain times of the day, even if they do not seem to go out of
their usual way. These effects were found by performing regressions using count
models over the states of the cellphone network during each day under study.
The models used controlled for land use, daily patterns, and points of interest
in the city.
  Our results indicate that, on business days, there are more people on the
street at commuting times, meaning that people did not change their daily
routines but slightly adapted them to play the game. Conversely, on Saturday
and Sunday night, people indeed went out to play, but favored places close to
where they live.
  Even if the statistical effects of the game do not reflect the massive change
in mobility behavior portrayed by the media, at least in terms of expanse, they
do show how ""the street"" may become a new place of leisure. This change should
have an impact on long-term infrastructure investment by city officials, and on
the drafting of public policies aimed at stimulating pedestrian traffic.

from the decay of the $B-L$ gauge boson followed by the nuclear decay, the mass
of the lightest right-handed neutrino or the dark matter candidate can be

explain the anomalies in the beryllium decay and the relic dark matter
abundance consistent with neutrino masses. We also predict its spin-independent

transmitter-receiver~(Tx-Rx) pairs under stochastic data arrival~(GIC-SDA).
Information bits arrive at the transmitters according to independent and
asynchronous Bernoulli processes~(Tx-Tx~asynchrony). Each information source
turns off after generating a given total number of bits. The transmissions are
\textit{asynchronous} (Tx-Rx~asynchrony) in the sense that each Tx sends a
codeword to its Rx immediately after there are enough bits available in its
buffer. Such asynchronous style of transmission is shown to significantly
reduce the transmission delay in comparison with the existing Tx-Rx synchronous
transmission schemes. The receivers learn the activity frames of both
transmitters by employing sequential joint-typicality detection. As a
consequence, the GIC-SDA under Tx-Rx asynchrony is represented by a standard
GIC with state known at the receivers. The cardinality of the state space is
$\binom{2N_1+2N_2}{2N_2}$ in which $N_1, N_2$ are the numbers of transmitted
codewords by the two transmitters. Each realization of the state imposes two
sets of constraints on $N_1, N_2$ referred to as the geometric and reliability
constraints. In a scenario where the transmitters are only aware of the
statistics of Tx-Tx~asynchrony, it is shown how one designs $N_1,N_2$ to
achieve target transmission rates for both users and minimize the probability
of unsuccessful decoding.

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major problem in health care. A
standard approach that the medical community has devised to manage widely
prevalent chronic diseases such as chronic heart failure (CHF) is to have a
committee of experts develop guidelines that all physicians should follow.
These guidelines typically consist of a series of complex rules that make
recommendations based on a patient's information. Due to their complexity,
often the guidelines are either ignored or not complied with at all, which can
result in poor medical practices. It is not even clear whether it is humanly
possible to follow these guidelines due to their length and complexity. In the
case of CHF management, the guidelines run nearly 80 pages. In this paper we
describe a physician-advisory system for CHF management that codes the entire
set of clinical practice guidelines for CHF using answer set programming. Our
approach is based on developing reasoning templates (that we call knowledge
patterns) and using these patterns to systemically code the clinical guidelines
for CHF as ASP rules. Use of the knowledge patterns greatly facilitates the
development of our system. Given a patient's medical information, our system
generates a recommendation for treatment just as a human physician would, using
the guidelines. Our system will work even in the presence of incomplete
information. Our work makes two contributions: (i) it shows that highly complex
guidelines can be successfully coded as ASP rules, and (ii) it develops a
series of knowledge patterns that facilitate the coding of knowledge expressed
in a natural language and that can be used for other application domains. This
paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

suitable for large-scale applications: from cold starts, in less than 60
minutes, Helios can analyze roughly 4.6 billion records in logs of 400GB with
about 300 million potential categorical combinations, then generate ranked
categorical combinations as recommended discoveries. We also show that, even

fruits. Experiments were conducted in a commercial apple orchard near
Melbourne, Australia. The results show an improvement in fruit segmentation
performance with the inclusion of metadata on the previously benchmarked MLP
network. We extend this work with CNNs, bringing agrovision closer to the
state-of-the-art in computer vision, where although metadata had negligible
influence, the best pixel-wise F1-score of $0.791$ was achieved. The WS
algorithm produced the best apple detection and counting results, with a

accumulated over multiple rows at the orchard and compared against the
post-harvest fruit counts that were obtained from a grading and counting

estimates of the North Galactic Pole (NGP) using recent catalogues of Galactic
disc tracer objects such as embedded and open clusters, infrared bubbles, dark
clouds, and young massive stars. Using these catalogues, we provide two new
estimates of the NGP. Solution 1 is an ""unconstrained"" NGP determined by the
galactic tracer sources, which does not take into account the location of Sgr
A*, and which lies 90{\deg}.120$\,\pm\,$0{\deg}.029 from Sgr A*, and Solution 2
is a ""constrained"" NGP which lies exactly 90{\deg} from Sgr A*. The
""unconstrained"" NGP has ICRS position: $\alpha_{NGP}$ = 192{\deg}.729 $\,\pm\,$
0{\deg}.035, $\delta_{NGP}$ = 27{\deg}.084 $\,\pm\,$ 0{\deg}.023 and $\theta\,$

90{\deg} away from Sgr A* has ICRS position: $\alpha_{NGP}$ = 192{\deg}.728

$\theta\,$ = 122{\deg}.928 $\,\pm\,$ 0{\deg}.016. The difference between the
solutions is likely due to the Sun lying above the Galactic midplane.
Considering the angular separation between Sgr A* and our unconstrained NGP,
and if one adopts the recent estimate of the Galactocentric distance for the
Sun of $R_{0}$ = 8.2$\,\pm\,$0.1 kpc, then we estimate that the Sun lies
$z_{\odot}$ $\simeq$ 17$\,\pm\,$5 pc above the Galactic midplane. Our value of
$z_{\odot}$ is consistent with the true median of 55 previous estimates
published over the past century of the Sun's height above the Galactic
mid-plane ($z_{\odot}$ $\simeq$ 17$\,\pm\,$2 pc).

whether the absorbing gas is simply the far wind of WR 79 or a collective
cluster wind enriched by carbon from the wind of WR 79. If it is simply due to
the wind, then this wind must flow, unimpeded for more than 2 pc, suggesting
that the inner region of the cluster is nearly devoid of obstructing material.
If it is actually a collective wind from the cluster, then we could be
witnessing an important stage of galactic feedback. In either case, the
observations provide a unique and significant piece to the puzzle of how
massive, open clusters evolve.

time as expressed in the motions of bodies, in the (special) theory of
relativity we can regard the inertial time as the only notion of time at play.
The inertial time is expressed also in the propagation of light. This gives
rise to a notion of clock, the light clock, which we can regard as a notion
derived from the inertial time. The light clock can be seen as a solution of
the theory, which complies with the requirement that a clock to be so must have
a rate that is independent of its past history. Contrary to Einstein's view, we
do not need the concept of clock as an independent concept. This implies, in
particular, that we do not need to rely on the notions of atomic clock or
atomic time in the theory of relativity.

in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. They drive jets, suppress
fragmentation in star-forming clouds and can have a significant impact on the
accretion rate of stars. However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic
magnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing
recent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent
dynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic
fields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for
incompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible
astrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations
and shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works
not only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, compressible
plasmas, as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further
present new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the
turbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component ($B_\mathrm{turb}$) in the
presence of weak and strong guide fields ($B_0$). I vary $B_0$ over 5 orders of
magnitude and find that the dependence of $B_\mathrm{turb}$ on $B_0$ is
relatively weak, and can be explained with a simple theoretical model in which
the turbulence provides the energy to amplify $B_\mathrm{turb}$. Finally, I
discuss some important implications of magnetic fields for the structure of
accretion discs, the launching of jets, and the star formation rate of
interstellar clouds.

  Pattern Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new online method based on nonparametric weighted feature
extraction (NWFE) is proposed. NWFE was introduced to enjoy optimum
characteristics of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and nonparametric
discriminant analysis (NDA) while rectifying their drawbacks. It emphasizes the
points near decision boundary by putting greater weights on them and
deemphasizes other points. Incremental nonparametric weighted feature
extraction (INWFE) is the online version of NWFE. INWFE has advantages of NWFE
method such as extracting more than L-1 features in contrast to LDA. It is
independent of the class distribution and performs well in complex distributed
data. The effects of outliers are reduced due to the nature of its
nonparametric scatter matrix. Furthermore, it is possible to add new samples
asynchronously, i.e. whenever a new sample becomes available at any given time,
it can be added to the algorithm. This is useful for many real world
applications since all data cannot be available in advance. This method is
implemented on Gaussian and non-Gaussian multidimensional data, a number of UCI
datasets and Indian Pine dataset. Results are compared with NWFE in terms of
classification accuracy and execution time. For nearest neighbour classifier it
shows that this technique converges to NWFE at the end of learning process. In
addition, the computational complexity is reduced in comparison with NWFE in
terms of execution time.

Maxwellian distribution function (MDF) and in some cases small deviations are
described using the perturbation theory. The deviations with respect to the
Maxwellian equilibrium, called kinetic effects, are required to be taken into
account specially for fusion reactor plasmas. Generally, because the
perturbation theory is not consistent with observed steady-state
non-Maxwellians, these kinetic effects are numerically evaluated by very
CPU-expensive codes, avoiding the analytic complexity of velocity phase space
integrals. We develop here a new method based on analytic non-Maxwellian
distribution functions constructed from non-orthogonal basis sets in order to
(i) use as few parameters as possible, (ii) increase the efficiency to model
numerical and experimental non-Maxwellians, (iii) help to understand unsolved
problems such as diagnostics discrepancies from the physical interpretation of
the parameters, and (iv) obtain analytic corrections due to kinetic effects
given by a small number of terms and removing the numerical error of the
evaluation of velocity phase space integrals. This work does not attempt to
derive new physical effects even if it could be possible to discover one from
the better understandings of some unsolved problems, but here we focus on the
analytic prediction of kinetic corrections from analytic non-Maxwellians. As
applications, examples of analytic kinetic corrections are shown for the
secondary electron emission, the Langmuir probe characteristic curve, and the
entropy. This is done by using three analytic representations of the
distribution function: the Kappa (KDF), the bi-modal or a new interpreted
non-Maxwellian (INMDF) distribution function. [...]

method involves discretizing the master field equation and expressing it in
form of a homogeneous system of linear algebraic equations. The resulting
homogeneous matrix equation furnishes a non-standard eigenvalue problem, which
can then be solved numerically to obtain the quasinormal frequencies. A key
feature of the present approach is that the discretization of the wave function
and its derivatives are made to be independent of any specific metric through
coordinate transformation. In many cases, it can be carried out beforehand
which in turn improves the efficiency and facilitates the numerical
implementation. We also analyze the precision and efficiency of the present

learn distributed representations of text, and match the query against the

models, on the other hand, terms have discrete or local representations, and
the relevance of a document is determined by the exact matches of query terms
in the body text. We hypothesize that matching with distributed representations
complements matching with traditional local representations, and that a
combination of the two is favorable. We propose a novel document ranking model
composed of two separate deep neural networks, one that matches the query and
the document using a local representation, and another that matches the query
and the document using learned distributed representations. The two networks
are jointly trained as part of a single neural network. We show that this
combination or `duet' performs significantly better than either neural network
individually on a Web page ranking task, and also significantly outperforms
traditional baselines and other recently proposed models based on neural

intrinsic properties such as spin period and magnetic field, as also data on
related phenomena such as microstructure, nulling, glitching, etc. This will
present a unique opportunity to seek answers to interesting and fundamental
questions about the extreme physics underlying these exotic objects in the
universe. In this paper, we first present a meta-analysis (from a
methodological viewpoint) of statistical analyses performed using existing NS
data, with a two-fold goal: First, this should bring out how statistical models
and methods are shaped and dictated by the science problem being addressed.
Second, it is hoped that these analyses will provide useful starting points for
deeper analyses involving richer data from SKA whenever it becomes available.

resonators. They use the Kerr nonlinearity to both compensate dispersion and to
offset optical loss. Besides providing insights into nonlinear resonator
physics, they can be applied in frequency metrology, precision clocks, and
spectroscopy. Like other optical solitons, the dissipative Kerr soliton can
radiate power in the form of a dispersive wave through a process that is the
optical analogue of Cherenkov radiation. Dispersive waves typically consist of
an ensemble of optical modes. A limiting case is demonstrated in which the
dispersive wave is concentrated into a single cavity mode. In this limit, its
interaction with the soliton is shown to induce bistable behavior in the
spectral and temporal properties of the soliton. Also, an operating point of
enhanced repetition-rate stability is predicted and observed. The single-mode
dispersive wave can therefore provide quiet states of soliton comb operation
useful in many applications.

data such as DNA, is an enterprise that yields valuable evolutionary
understanding of many biological systems. Bayesian phylogenetic algorithms,
which approximate a posterior distribution on trees, have become a popular if
computationally expensive means of doing phylogenetics. Modern data collection
technologies are quickly adding new sequences to already substantial databases.
With all current techniques for Bayesian phylogenetics, computation must start
anew each time a sequence becomes available, making it costly to maintain an
up-to-date estimate of a phylogenetic posterior. These considerations highlight
the need for an \emph{online} Bayesian phylogenetic method which can update an
existing posterior with new sequences.
  Here we provide theoretical results on the consistency and stability of
methods for online Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We first show a consistency
result, demonstrating that the method samples from the correct distribution in
the limit of a large number of particles. Next we derive the first reported set
of bounds on how phylogenetic likelihood surfaces change when new sequences are
added. These bounds enable us to characterize the theoretical performance of
sampling algorithms by bounding the effective sample size (ESS) with a given
number of particles from below. We show that the ESS is guaranteed to grow
linearly as the number of particles in an SMC sampler grows. Surprisingly, this
result holds even though the dimensions of the phylogenetic model grow with
each new added sequence.

Simultaneous observations from IRIS, consisting of UV spectra and slit-jaw

dynamics of jets not seen in EUV images. We studied a series of small jets from
recently formed bipole pairs beside the trailing spot of active region 11991,

collimated outflows with bright roots in the SJI 1400 {\AA} (transition region)

two types of Mg II line profiles produced by the jets spires: reversed and
non-reversed. Mg II lines remain optically thick but turn into optically thin

jet is estimated using a velocity differential emission measure technique which
measures the emitting power of the plasma as a function of line-of-sight

for wireless network due to its limited capacity. To tackle this hurdle,
wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) take the smart data pricing to

reasonable and desired to employ mobile data traffic management under the
pricing policies of WISPs to improve the economic efficiency of data
consumption. In this paper we introduce a concept of cost efficiency for user's
mobile data management, defined as the ratio of user's mobile data consumption
benefits and its expense. We propose an integrated cost-efficiency-based data
traffic management scheme including long-term data demand planning, short-term
data traffic pre-scheduling and real-time data traffic management. The
real-time data traffic management algorithm is proposed to coordinate user's
data consumption to tailor to the pre-scheduled data traffic profile. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of cost efficiency framework in
indicating and motivating mobile user's data consumption behavior. The proposed
management scheme can effectively motivate the user to adjust its data
consumption profile to obtain the optimal data consumption cost efficiency.

Contains new results and rewriting",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A family of sets is intersecting if every pair of its sets intersect. A star
is a family with some element (a center) in each of its sets. The classical
1961 result of Erd\H{o}s, Ko, and Rado states that every intersecting family of
r-sets with $r\leq n/2$ has size at most that of a star. We say that graph G is
r-EKR if, among all intersecting families of independent r-sets of G, the
largest is attained by a star. In 2005 Holroyd and Talbot conjectured that
every graph G is r-EKR for all $1\leq r\leq \mu(G)/2$, where $\mu(G)$ is the
size of the smallest maximal independent set in G. We verified the conjecture
in 2011 for all chordal graphs containing an isolated vertex.
  For graphs without isolated vertices it is difficult to determine the center
of the largest star, which is often necessary to prove that they are EKR. A
tree has the leaf property if its largest star occurs on one of its leaves. We
proved that every tree T has the leaf property when $r\leq 4$, and in 2017 Borg
and other authors gave examples of families of trees not having the leaf
property when $r\geq 5$. A split vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree at
least 3. A spider is a tree with exactly one split vertex. Here we prove that
all spiders have the leaf property for all $r\leq \alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$
is the independence number of $G$, and we characterize which of its leaves are
maximum star centers. A pendant tree is one for which each of its split
vertices is adjacent to a leaf. Here we show that all pendant trees have the
leaf property for all $r\leq \alpha(G)$. We also consider pendant trees with
exactly two split vertices and provide partial results on the locations of
their maximum star centers.

this framework, we are given a set of jobs, each with a release time, deadline
and required processing length. The jobs need to be scheduled on a machine so
that at most g jobs are active at any given time. The duration for which a
machine is active (i.e., ""on"") is referred to as its active time. The goal is
to find a feasible schedule for all jobs, minimizing the total active time.
When preemption is allowed at integer time points, we show that a minimal
feasible schedule already yields a 3-approximation (and this bound is tight)
and we further improve this to a 2-approximation via LP rounding techniques.
Our second contribution is for the non-preemptive version of this problem.
However, since even asking if a feasible schedule on one machine exists is
NP-hard, we allow for an unbounded number of virtual machines, each having
capacity of g. This problem is known as the busy time problem in the literature
and a 4-approximation is known for this problem. We develop a new combinatorial
algorithm that gives a 3-approximation. Furthermore, we consider the preemptive
busy time problem, giving a simple and exact greedy algorithm when unbounded
parallelism is allowed, i.e., g is unbounded. For arbitrary g, this yields an
algorithm that is 2-approximate.

through a selection process in a complex heterogeneous population structure. In
the present work, we investigate evolutionary dynamics in a phenotypically
heterogeneous population of stem cells (SCs) and their associated progenitors.
The fate of a malignant mutation is determined not only by overall stem cell
and differentiated cell growth rates but also differentiation and
dedifferentiation rates. We investigate the effect of such a complex population
structure on the evolution of malignant mutations. We derive exact analytic
results for the fixation probability of a mutant arising in each of the
subpopulations. The analytic results are in almost perfect agreement with the
numerical simulations. Moreover, a condition for evolutionary advantage of a
mutant cell versus the wild type population is given in the present study. We
also show that microenvironment-induced plasticity in invading mutants leads to
more aggressive mutants with higher fixation probability. Our model predicts
that decreasing polarity between stem and differentiated cells turnover would
raise the survivability of non-plastic mutants; while it would suppress the
development of malignancy for plastic mutants. We discuss our model in the
context of colorectal/intestinal cancer (at the epithelium). This novel
mathematical framework can be applied more generally to a variety of problems
concerning selection in heterogeneous populations, in other contexts such as
population genetics, and ecology.

lack of glass-forming ability in the twin system Ge-Sb-Te at the same Ge

the latter system shows a behavior opposite to that of more covalent system.
Comparison of Tg vs bond density in the three systems Ge-As-chalcogen differing
in chalcogen i.e. S, Se, or Te, shows that as the chalcogen becomes more
metallic, i.e. in the order S<Se<Te the bond density effect on Tg becomes
systematically weaker, with a crossover at <r> = 2.3. When the more metallic Sb
replaces As at <r> greater than 2.3, incipient metallicity rather than
directional bond covalency apparently gains control of the physics. This leads
us to an examination of the electronic conductivity and, then,
semiconductor-to-metal (SC-M) transitions, with their associated thermodynamic
manifestations, in relevant liquid alloys. The thermodynamic components, as
seen previously, control liquid fragility and cause fragile-to-strong
transitions during cooling. We tentatively conclude that liquid state behavior
in phase change materials (PCMs) is controlled by liquid-liquid (SC-M)
transitions that have become submerged below the liquidus surface. In the case
of the Ge-Te binary, a crude extrapolation to GeTe stoichiometry indicates that
the SC-M transition lies about 20% below the melting point, suggesting a
parallel with the intensely researched ""hidden liquid-liquid (LL) transition"",
in supercooled water. In the water case, superfast crystallization initiates in
the high fragility domain some 4% above the TLL which is located at ~15% below

the difference in expectations between predicted and manually-measured vowel

nontrivial specifications of processes that influence the birth, death,
development and movement of individuals in the environment, that take into

they are composed of agents that can progress simultaneously but also interact

Array (SKA), large samples of explosive transients are expected to be
discovered. Radio wavelengths, especially in commensal survey mode, are
particularly well suited for uncovering the complex transient phenomena. This
is because observations at radio wavelengths may suffer less obscuration than
in other bands (e.g. optical/IR or X-rays) due to dust absorption. At the same
time, multiwaveband information often provides critical source classification
rapidly than possible with only radio band data. Therefore, multiwaveband
observational efforts with wide fields of view will be the key to progress of
transients astronomy from the middle 2020s offering unprecedented deep images
and high spatial and spectral resolutions. Radio observations of gamma ray
bursts (GRBs) with SKA will uncover not only much fainter bursts and verifying
claims of sensitivity limited population versus intrinsically dim GRBs, they
will also unravel the enigmatic population of orphan afterglows. The supernova
rate problem caused by dust extinction in optical bands is expected to be
lifted in the SKA era. In addition, the debate of single degenerate scenario
versus double degenerate scenario will be put to rest for the progenitors of
thermonuclear supernovae, since highly sensitive measurements will lead to very
accurate mass loss estimation in these supernovae. One also expects to detect
gravitationally lensed supernovae in far away Universe in the SKA bands. Radio
counterparts of the gravitational waves are likely to become a reality once SKA
comes online. In addition, SKA is likely to discover various new kinds of
transients.

diffuse foreground component for future cosmological 21-cm observations. The
DGSE is also an important probe of the cosmic ray electron and magnetic field
distributions in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. In this
paper we briefly review the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) which can be used
to quantify the angular power spectrum of the sky signal directly from the
visibilities measured in radio-interferometric observations. The salient
features of the TGE are (1.) it deals with the gridded data which makes it
computationally very fast (2.) it avoids a positive noise bias which normally
arises from the system noise inherent to the visibility data, and (3.) it
allows us to taper the sky response and thereby suppresses the contribution
from unsubtracted point sources in the outer parts and the sidelobes of the
antenna beam pattern. We also summarize earlier work where the TGE was used to
measure the C_l of the DGSE using 150 MHz GMRT data. Earlier measurements of
the angular power spectrum are restricted to smaller angular multipole l ~ 10^3
for the DGSE, the signal at the larger l values is dominated by the residual
point sources after source subtraction. The higher sensitivity of the upcoming
SKA1 Low will allow the point sources to be subtracted to a fainter level than
possible with existing telescopes. We predict that it will be possible to
measure the angular power spectrum of the DGSE to larger values of l with SKA1

underlying the complex behavior observed in biological systems, microblogs and

their structures are often unobservable, in order to facilitate network
analytics, one generally resorts to approaches capitalizing on measurable nodal
processes to infer the unknown topology. Structural equation models (SEMs) are
capable of incorporating exogenous inputs to resolve inherent directional
ambiguities. However, conventional SEMs assume full knowledge of exogenous
inputs, which may not be readily available in some practical settings. The
present paper advocates a novel SEM-based topology inference approach that
entails factorization of a three-way tensor, constructed from the observed
nodal data, using the well-known parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. It
turns out that second-order piecewise stationary statistics of exogenous
variables suffice to identify the hidden topology. Capitalizing on the
uniqueness properties inherent to high-order tensor factorizations, it is shown
that topology identification is possible under reasonably mild conditions. In
addition, to facilitate real-time operation and inference of time-varying
networks, an adaptive (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition scheme which tracks the
topology-revealing tensor factors is developed. Extensive tests on simulated
and real stock quote data demonstrate the merits of the novel tensor-based
approach.

entropy was originally formulated in discrete time, in this paper we provide a
framework for considering transfer entropy in continuous time systems, based on
Radon-Nikodym derivatives between measures of complete path realizations. To
describe the information dynamics of individual path realizations, we introduce
the pathwise transfer entropy, the expectation of which is the transfer entropy
accumulated over a finite time interval. We demonstrate that this formalism
permits an instantaneous transfer entropy rate. These properties are analogous
to the behavior of physical quantities defined along paths such as work and
heat. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer entropy
for pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the specific case
of point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model neural spike
trains). Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model examples to
exhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely, that the information
flow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at
spikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying contribution
(relating to waiting times between target spikes). Numerical schemes based on

we develop a randomized block stochastic mirror-prox (B-SMP) algorithm, where
at each iteration only a randomly selected block coordinate of the solution is
updated through implementing two consecutive projection steps. Under standard
assumptions on the problem and settings of the algorithm, we show that when the
mapping is strictly pseudo-monotone, the algorithm generates a sequence of
iterates that converges to the solution of the problem almost surely. To derive
rate statements, we assume that the maps are strongly pseudo-monotone and
obtain {a non-asymptotic mean squared error
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{k}\right)$, where $k$ is the iteration number and
$d$ is the number of component sets. Second, we consider large-scale stochastic
optimization problems with convex objectives. For this class of problems, we
develop a new averaging scheme for the B-SMP algorithm. Unlike the classical
averaging stochastic mirror-prox (SMP) method where a decreasing set of weights
for the averaging sequence is used, here we consider a different set of weights
that are characterized in terms of the stepsizes and a {parameter}. We show
that using such weights, the objective values of the averaged sequence
converges to the optimal value in the mean sense with the rate
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$.

or edges are randomly selected with probability below the value, the network is
fragmented but when the probability is above the value, a giant component
connecting large portion of the network would emerge. Assessing the percolation
threshold of networks has wide applications in network reliability, information
spread, epidemic control, etc. The theoretical approach so far to assess the
percolation threshold is mainly based on spectral radius of adjacency matrix or
non-backtracking matrix, which is limited to dense graphs or locally treelike
graphs, and is less effective for sparse networks with non-negligible amount of
triangles and loops. In this paper, we study high-order non-backtracking
matrices and their application to assessing percolation threshold. We first
define high-order non-backtracking matrices and study the properties of their
spectral radii. Then we focus on 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix and
demonstrate analytically that the reciprocal of its spectral radius gives a
tighter lower bound than those of adjacency and standard non-backtracking
matrices. We further build a smaller size matrix with the same largest
eigenvalue as the 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix to improve computation
efficiency. Finally, we use both synthetic networks and 42 real networks to
illustrate that the use of 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix does give better
lower bound for assessing percolation threshold than adjacency and standard
non-backtracking matrices.

storage systems. In a distributed storage system, every storage node has a
probability to fail and once an individual storage node fails, it must be
reconstructed using data stored in the surviving nodes. Computation load and
network bandwidth are two important issues we need to concern when repairing a
failed node. The traditional maximal distance separable (MDS) storage codes
have low repair complexity but high repair bandwidth. On the contrary, minimal
storage regenerating (MSR) codes have low repair bandwidth but high repair
complexity. Fortunately, the newly introduced piggyback codes combine the
advantages of both ones.
  In this paper, by introducing a novel piggybacking design framework for
systematic MDS codes, we construct a storage code whose average repair
bandwidth rate, i.e., the ratio of average repair bandwidth and the amount of
the original data, can be as low as $\frac{\sqrt{2r-1}}{r}$, which
significantly improves the ratio $\frac{r-1}{2r-1}$ of the previous result. In
the meanwhile, every failed systematic node of the new code can be
reconstructed quickly using the decoding algorithm of an MDS code, only with
some additional additions over the underlying finite field. This is very fast
compared with the complex matrix multiplications needed in the repair of a
failed node of an MSR code.

is the product of the input OAM and the scaling parameter. The residual light

antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of atomic spins. When ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets are coupled together, they often exhibit the exchange bias
effect, a unidirectional interface exchange field causing a shift of the
magnetic hysteresis loop. The effective magnitude of this interface exchange
field is at most a few percent of the bulk exchange, arising from pinned
interfacial spins in the antiferromagnet. The pinned spins are known to
comprise a small fraction of the total number of interface spins, yet their
exact nature and physical origin has so far been elusive. Here we show that in
the technologically important $\gamma - IrMn_3/CoFe$ structure the pinned
interface spins are in fact delocalised over the whole interface layer. The
pinned spins arise from the small imbalance of the number of spins in each
magnetic sublattice in the antiferromagnet due to the natural atomic disorder.
These pinned spins are strongly coupled to the bulk antiferromagnet explaining
their remarkable stability. Moreover, we find that the ferromagnet strongly
distorts the interface spin structure of the antiferromagnet, causing a large
reversible interface magnetisation that does not contribute to exchange bias.
The unexpected delocalised nature of the pinned interface spins explains both
their small number and their stability, uncovering the mysterious microscopic
origin of the exchange bias effect.

there is need for count data models that can capture complex nonlinear

illustrate the usefulness of this approach through extensive simulation studies

low-mass objects: planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We study the effect
of radiative feedback from such newly-formed secondary objects using radiative
hydrodynamic simulations. We compare the results of simulations without any
radiative feedback from secondary objects with those where two types of
radiative feedback are considered: (i) continuous, and (ii) episodic. We find
that: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses
further fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)
episodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the
outburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes
unstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed
compared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass
growth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due to the effect of their
radiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form
in the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses
are not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback. We find
that the masses of secondary objects formed by disc fragmentation are from a
few M$_{\rm J}$ to a few 0.1 M$_{\odot}$. Planets formed by fragmentation tend
to be ejected from the disc. We conclude that planetary-mass objects on wide
orbits (wide-orbit planets) are unlikely to form by disc fragmentation.
Nevertheless, disc fragmentation may be a significant source of free-floating
planets and brown dwarfs.

world. It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from
Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering
from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important
to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the
necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is
being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that
precede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a
patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms
considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and
olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in
predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this
paper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and
olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important
biomarkers. In this paper, we try to model this classifier using different
machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated
diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and
Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic
Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159
% and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that these

Grassmannian sources. The proposed approach relies on a structured codebook
based on a geometric construction of a collection of bent grids defined from an
initial mesh on the unit-norm sphere. The associated encoding and decoding
algorithms have very low complexity (equivalent to a scalar quantizer), while
their efficiency (in terms of the achieved distortion) is on par with the best
known structured approaches, and compares well with the theoretical bounds.
These properties make this codebook suitable for high-resolutions, real-time
applications such as channel state feedback in massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.

based on new evolutionary tracks including the effect of helium diffusion, and
approximately accounting for the effect of metal levitation in a stable

becomes hotter than 11,500 K only for stars that have, in this T$_{eff}$ range,

the modelling of the HB in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. In these clusters we predict

innovation through virtualization of traditional network functions located
flexibly in the network in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Since VNFs
can only be placed onto servers located in networked data centers, which is the
NFV's salient feature, the traffic directed to these data center areas has
significant impact on network load balancing. Network load balancing can be
even more critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service
Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. To
balance the network load, VNF's can be placed in a smaller cluster of servers
in the network thus minimizing the distance to the data center. The
optimization of the placement of these clusters is a challenge as also other
factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address
this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and
especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network.
We design and compare three optimization methods, including Linear Programing
(LP) model, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Fit Placement Algorithm (RFPA)
for the allocation and replication of VNFs. Our results show that the optimum
placement and replication can significantly improve load balancing, for which
we also propose a GA heuristics applicable to larger networks.

maximum size of just below 700 m, and a slightly elongated shape with a/b ~1.1.

the hot medium arising from the collision, interacting strongly with the

heavy quarks may or not approach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma, tending
in the first case to follow the collective flow of the expanding fireball. The
presence of a hot deconfined medium may also affect heavy-quark hadronization,
being possible for them to recombine with the surrounding light thermal

the medium. Here we show how it is possible to develop a complete transport

  arXiv:1511.00237",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop a generalization of the Gaussian quasi score test
(GQST) for composite binary hypothesis testing. The proposed test, called
measure transformed GQST (MT-GQST), is based on the score-function of the
measure transformed Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood estimator (MT-GQMLE) that
operates by empirically fitting a Gaussian model to a transformed probability
measure of the data. By judicious choice of the transform we show that, unlike
the GQST, the proposed MT-GQST involves higher-order statistical moments and
can gain resilience to outliers, leading to significant mitigation of the model
mismatch effect on the decision performance. A data-driven procedure for
optimal selection of the measure transformation parameters is developed that
minimizes the spectral norm of the empirical asymptotic error-covariance of the
MT-GQMLE. This amounts to maximization of an empirical worst-case asymptotic
local power at a fixed asymptotic size. The MT-GQST is applied to location
mismatch detection of a near-field point source in a simulation example that
illustrates its robustness to outliers.

such as the Internet, where dishonest users may listen to communications and
interfere with them. A secure communication has a different meaning depending
on the underlying application. It ranges from the confidentiality of a data to
e.g. verifiability in electronic voting systems. Another example of a security
notion is privacy.
  Formal symbolic models have proved their usefulness for analysing the
security of protocols. Until quite recently, most results focused on trace
properties like confidentiality or authentication. There are however several
security properties, which cannot be defined (or cannot be naturally defined)
as trace properties and require a notion of behavioural equivalence. Typical
examples are anonymity, and privacy related properties. During the last decade,
several results and verification tools have been developed to analyse
equivalence-based security properties.
  We propose here a synthesis of decidability and undecidability results for
equivalence-based security properties. Moreover, we give an overview of
existing verification tools that may be used to verify equivalence-based
security properties.

Rayleigh-Taylor instability driven upflows and impulsive downflows, and so it
is no surprise that turbulent motions also exist. As prominences are believed
to have a mean horizontal guide field, investigating any turbulence they host
could shed light on the nature of MHD turbulence in a wide range of
astrophysical systems. In this paper we have investigated the nature of the
turbulent prominence motions using structure function analysis on the velocity
increments estimated from H$\alpha$ Dopplergrams constructed with observational
data from Hinode SOT. The pdf of the velocity increments shows that as we look
at increasingly small spatial separations the distribution displays greater
departure from a reference Gaussian distribution, hinting at intermittency in
the velocity field. Analysis of the even order structure functions for both the
horizontal and vertical separations showed the existence of two distinct
regions displaying different exponents of the power law with the break in the
power law at approximately 2000km. We hypothesise this to be a result of
internal turbulence excited in the prominence by the dynamic flows of the
system found at this spatial scale. We found that the scaling exponents of the
p-th order structure functions for these two regions generally followed the p/2
(smaller scales) and p/4 (larger scales) laws that are the same as those
predicted for weak MHD turbulence and Kraichnan-Iroshnikov turbulence
respectively. However, the existence of the p/4 scaling at larger scales than
the p/2 scaling is inconsistent with the increasing nonlinearity expected in
MHD turbulence. Estimating the heating from the turbulent energy dissipation
showed that this turbulent heating would be very inefficient, but that the mass
diffusion through turbulence driven reconnection was of the order of
$10^{10}$cm$^2$/s.

most commonly broken by an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (SOC) removing the
spin degeneracy and splitting the Fermi surface (FS) into two branches. A two
component condensate is then produced with a doublet pair potential mixing an
even singlet and an odd triplet. When the triplet and the singlet strengths are
comparable, the pair potential can have rich nodes. The angular line nodes
(ALNs) are associated with strong anisotropy and they are widely studied in the
literature. When the anisotropy is not strong, they can be replaced by other
types of nodes in closed or open forms affecting the low temperature
properties.
  Here, we focus on the weakly anisotropic case and the line nodes in the
superconducting plane which become circular in the limit of full isotropy. We
study the topology of these radial line nodes (RLNs) and show that it is
characterized by the $Z_2$ classification similar to the Quantum-Spin-Hall
Insulators. From the thermodynamical perspective, the RLNs cause, even in the
topological phases, an exponentially suppressed low temperature behaviour which
can be mistaken by nodeless s-wave pairing, thus, providing an explanation to a
number of recent experiments with contraversial pairing symmetries. In the rare
case when the RLN is on the Fermi surface, the exponential suppression is
replaced by a linear temperature dependence. The RLNs are difficult to detect,
and for this reason, they may have escaped experimental attention. We
demonstrate that Andreev conductance measurements with clean interfaces can
efficiently probe the weakly anisotropic samples where the RLNs are expected to
be found.

instruments MATISSE and GRAVITY require fringe tracking up to magnitudes K>14
with the UTs and K>10 with the ATs. The GRAVITY fringe tracker (FT) will be
limited to K~10.5 with UTs and K~7.5 with ATs, for fundamental conceptual
reasons: the flux of each telescope is distributed among 3 cophasing pairs and
then among 5 spectral channels for coherencing. To overcome this limit we
propose a new FT concept, called Hierarchical Fringe Tracker (HFT) that cophase
pairs of apertures with all the flux from two apertures and only one spectral
channel. When the pair is cophased, most of the flux is transmitted as if it
was produced by an unique single mode beam and then used to cophase pairs of
pairs and then pairs of groups. At the deeper level, the flux is used in an
optimized dispersed fringe device for coherencing. On the VLTI such a system
allows a gain of about 3 magnitudes over the GRAVITY FT. On interferometers
with more apertures such as CHARA (6 telescopes) or a future Planet Formation
Imager (12 to 20 telescopes), the HFT would be even more decisive, as its
performance does not decrease with the number of apertures. It would allow
building a PFI reaching a coherent magnitude H~10 with 16 apertures with
diameters smaller than 2 m. We present the HFT concept, the first steps of its
feasibility demonstration from computer simulations and the optical design of a
4 telescopes HFT prototype.

interferometer intended to obtain images of the planet formation process at
scales as small as the Hill sphere of giant exoplanets. Its main science
instruments will work in the thermal infrared but it will be cophased in the
near infrared, where it requires also some capacity for scientific imaging. PFI
imaging and resolution specifications imply an array of 12 to 20 apertures and
baselines up to a few kilometers cophased at near infrared coherent magnitudes
as large as 10. This paper discusses various cophasing architectures and the
corresponding minimum diameter of individual apertures, which is the dominant
element of PFI cost estimates. From a global analysis of the possible
combinations of pairwise fringe sensors, we show that conventional approaches
used in current interferometers imply the use of prohibitively large telescopes
and we indicate the innovative strategies that would allow building PFI with
affordable apertures smaller than 2 m in diameter. The approach with the best
potential appears to be Hierarchical Fringe Tracking based on ""two beams
spatial filters"" that cophase pairs of neighboring telescopes with all the
efficiency of a two telescopes fringe tracker and transmit most of the flux as
if it was produced by an unique single mode aperture to cophase pairs of pairs
and then pairs of groups of apertures. We consider also the adaptation to PFI
of more conventional approaches such as a combination of GRAVITY like fringe
trackers or single or multiple chains of 2T fringe trackers.

multi-antenna access points which serve multiple single antenna users. In this
scenario, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to design
jointly the Pareto optimal beamforming vector and the TS ratio for each
receiver. The objective is to maximize the utility vector including the
achieved data rates and the harvested energies of all users simultaneously.
This problem is a non-convex rank-constrained MOO problem which is relaxed and
transformed into a non-convex semidefinite program (SDP) based on the weighted
Chebycheff method. The majorization-minimization algorithm is utilized to solve
the nonconvex SDP and the optimal solution is proved to satisfy the rank
constraint. We also study the problem of optimizing the beamforming vectors in
a fixed TS ratio scenario with the same approach. Numerical results are
provided for two coordinated access points with MISO configuration. The results
illustrate the trade-off between harvested energy and information data rate
objectives and show the effect of optimizing the precoding strategy and TS
ratio on this trade-off.

magnetic fields in this active region during the flare employing the
magnetograms obtained in the spectral line Fe I 6173 Angstrom by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). The analysis of the line-of-sight magnetograms from HMI show sudden and
persistent magnetic field changes at different locations of the active region
before the onset of the flare and during the flare. The vector magnetic field
observations available from HMI also show coincident variations in the total
magnetic field strength and its inclination angle at these locations. Using the
simultaneous Dopplergrams obtained from HMI, we observe perturbations in the
photospheric Doppler signals following the sudden changes in the magnetic
fields in the aforementioned locations. The power spectrum analysis of these
velocity signals show enhanced acoustic power in these affected locations
during the flare as compared to the pre-flare condition. Accompanying these
observations, we have also used the near-simultaneous chromospheric
observations obtained in the spectral line H-alpha 6562.8 Angstrom by the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to study the evolution of flare ribbons
and intensity oscillations in the active region. The H-alpha intensity
oscillations also show enhanced oscillatory power during the flare in the

force associated with the sudden changes in the magnetic fields could drive the
localized photospheric and chromospheric oscillations, like the flare-induced
oscillations in the solar atmosphere.

that is a stationary, minimum-energy configuration called a ""soliton"",
surrounded by an envelope that resembles a CDM halo. (iii) The transition
between soliton and envelope is determined by a relaxation process analogous to
two-body relaxation in gravitating systems, which proceeds as if the halo were
composed of particles with mass $\sim \rho\lambda^3$ where $\rho$ is the halo
density. (iv) Relaxation may have substantial effects on the stellar disk and
bulge in the inner parts of disk galaxies. (v) Relaxation can produce FDM disks
but an FDM disk in the solar neighborhood must have a half-thickness of at
least $300 (m/10^{-22} {\rm eV})^{-2/3}$ pc. (vi) Solitonic FDM sub-halos
evaporate by tunneling through the tidal radius and this limits the minimum
sub-halo mass inside 30 kpc of the Milky Way to roughly $10^8 (m/10^{-22} {\rm

have long ago spiraled to its center, and this problem is resolved if the dark

encounter between the circumprimary disk and the secondary star. The primary
star has recently undergone two major dimming events ($\Delta$mag $\approx$ 2
in V-band), whose origin is still under debate. To shed light on the mechanism
leading to the dimming events, we study the extinction properties, accretion
variability, and gas kinematics using absorption lines from the material
obscuring star RW Aur A. We compare our moderate resolution X-Shooter spectra
of the dim state of RW Aur A with other spectral observations. In particular,
we analyse archival high resolution UVES spectra obtained during the bright
state of the system, in order to track the evolution of the spectral properties
across the second dimming event. The spectrum obtained during the dim state
shows narrow absorption lines in the Na and K optical doublets, where the
former is saturated. With a velocity of -60 km/s these lines indicate that
during the dim state the disk wind is either enhanced, or significantly
displaced into the line of sight. The photometric evolution across the dimming
event shows a gray extinction, and is correlated with a significant reduction
of the EW of all photospheric lines. Emission lines tracing accretion do not
vary significantly across the dimming. We conclude that the dimming event is
related to a major perturbation on the inner disk. We suggest that the inner
disk is occulting (most of) the star, and thus its photosphere, but is not
occulting the accretion regions within a few stellar radii. Since observations
of the outer disk indicate that the disk is modestly inclined (45 - 60 deg), we
propose that the inner disk might be warped by a yet unseen (sub-)stellar
companion, which may also explain the 2.77 day periodic variability of the
spectral lines.

involve string searching and data compression. Designing time/space-efficient
suffix array construction algorithms has attracted significant attention and
considerable advances have been made for the past 20 years. We obtain the
\emph{first} in-place suffix array construction algorithms that are optimal
both in time and space for (read-only) integer alphabets. Concretely, we make
the following contributions:
  1. For integer alphabets, we obtain the first suffix sorting algorithm which
takes linear time and uses only $O(1)$ workspace (the workspace is the total
space needed beyond the input string and the output suffix array). The input
string may be modified during the execution of the algorithm, but should be
restored upon termination of the algorithm.
  2. We strengthen the first result by providing the first in-place linear time
algorithm for read-only integer alphabets with $|\Sigma|=O(n)$ (i.e., the input
string cannot be modified). This algorithm settles the open problem posed by
Franceschini and Muthukrishnan in ICALP 2007. The open problem asked to design
in-place algorithms in $o(n\log n)$ time and ultimately, in $O(n)$ time for
(read-only) integer alphabets with $|\Sigma| \leq n$. Our result is in fact
slightly stronger since we allow $|\Sigma|=O(n)$.
  3. Besides, for the read-only general alphabets (i.e., only comparisons are
allowed), we present an optimal in-place $O(n\log n)$ time suffix sorting
algorithm, recovering the result obtained by Franceschini and Muthukrishnan

performed by coupling the genetic algorithm software DAKOTA to the mesh

the cost functional is the power ratio, whereas for the passive device it is
the drag coefficient. The optimization leads to total power savings of $\approx
70\%$ for the optimal Coanda actuator, and a 40\% drag reduction for the
optimal flap. This reduction is mainly achieved through streamlining the base
flow and suppressing the vortex shedding. The addition of either an active or a

base is a real or complex number $\beta$ such that $|\beta|>1$, and the digit
set $A$ is a finite set of digits including $0$. Thus a number can be seen as a
finite or infinite string of digits. An on-line algorithm processes the input
piece-by-piece in a serial fashion. On-line arithmetic, introduced by Trivedi
and Ercegovac, is a mode of computation where operands and results flow through
arithmetic units in a digit serial manner, starting with the most significant
digit.
  In this paper, we first formulate a generalized version of the on-line
algorithms for multiplication and division of Trivedi and Ercegovac for the
cases that $\beta$ is any real or complex number, and digits are real or
complex. We then define the so-called OL Property, and show that if $(\beta,
A)$ has the OL Property, then on-line multiplication and division are feasible
by the Trivedi-Ercegovac algorithms. For a real base $\beta$ and a digit set
$A$ of contiguous integers, the system $(\beta, A)$ has the OL Property if $\#
A > |\beta|$. For a complex base $\beta$ and symmetric digit set $A$ of
contiguous integers, the system $(\beta, A)$ has the OL Property if $\# A >
\beta\overline{\beta} + |\beta + \overline{\beta}|$. Provided that addition and
subtraction are realizable in parallel in the system $(\beta, A)$ and that
preprocessing of the denominator is possible, our on-line algorithms for
multiplication and division have linear time complexity. Three examples are
presented in detail: base $\beta=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ with digits
$A=\{-1,0,1\}$; base $\beta=2i$ with digits $A = \{-2,-1, 0,1,2\}$; and base
$\beta = -\frac{3}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -1 + \omega$, where $\omega =
\exp{\frac{2i\pi}{3}}$, with digits $A = \{0, \pm 1, \pm \omega, \pm \omega^2
\}$.

in the design of next-generation magnetic storage technology due to their
stability and the control of their motion by ultra-low current densities. A
major challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the
controlled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of
complex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to
create skyrmions and other magnetic textures in ferromagnetic thin films by
means of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising
from the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially
inhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved, e.g., by locally
engineering the anisotropy, the magnetic field, or other magnetic interactions.
The magnetic textures are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically
with a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose
specific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt
based materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that
adding chiral interactions will not influence the basics of the generations but
then influence the consequent dynamics with respect to the stabilization of
topological textures. Our findings allow for the production of skyrmions on
demand in simple ferromagnetic thin films by homogeneous DC currents.

many astrophysical systems. The equation for the growth rate of this
instability in the incompressible limit, and the most-unstable mode that can be
derived from it, are often used to estimate the strength of the magnetic field
that is associated with the observed dynamics. However, there are some issues
with the interpretations given. Here we show that the class of most unstable
modes $k_u$ for a given $\theta$, the class of modes often used to estimate the
strength of the magnetic field from observations, for the system leads to the
instability growing as $\sigma^2=1/2 A g k_u$, a growth rate which is
independent of the strength of the magnetic field and which highlights that
small scales are preferred by the system, but not does not give the fastest
growing mode for that given $k$. We also highlight that outside of the
interchange ($\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0$) and undular ($\mathbf{k}$ parallel
to $\mathbf{B}$) modes, all the other modes have a perturbation pair of the
same wavenumber and growth rate that when excited in the linear regime can
result in an interference pattern that gives field aligned filamentary
structure often seen in 3D simulations. The analysis was extended to a sheared
magnetic field, where it was found that it was possible to extend the results
for a non-sheared field to this case. We suggest that without magnetic shear it
is too simplistic to be used to infer magnetic field strengths in astrophysical

black hole jets using a relativistic fluid jet model, including in-situ
acceleration of non-thermal leptons by magnetic reconnection. Our results
demonstrate that including a self-consistent treatment of radiative energy
losses is necessary to perform accurate MHD simulations of powerful jets and
that jet spectra calculated via post-processing are liable to vastly
overestimate the amount of non-thermal emission. If no more than 95% of the
initial total jet power is radiated away by the plasma travels as it travels
along the length of the jet, we can place a lower bound on the magnetisation of
the jet plasma at the base of the jet. For typical powerful jets, we find that
the plasma at the jet base is required to be highly magnetised, with at least
10,000 times more energy contained in magnetic fields than in non-thermal
leptons. Using a simple power-law model of magnetic reconnection, motivated by
simulations of collisionless reconnection, we determine the allowed range of
the large-scale average reconnection rate along the jet, by restricting the
total radiative energy losses incurred and the distance at which the jet first
comes into equipartition. We calculate analytic expressions for the cumulative
radiative energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission along

present a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law
leaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall
within the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and
under what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such
non-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only
interesting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of
agency competence and the role of the courts.
  Two case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium
power supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers
in the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy
particle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider)
that allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a ""killer
strangelet""). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights
from neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and
cognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in
low-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of
judging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges
working in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns
suggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to
legal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency
actions that are non-regulatory in nature.

derived. The MCRM is derived by transforming the stationary nuclear Schrodinger
equation using a collective rotation-intrinsic product wavefunction, imposing
no constraints on the wavefunction and the nucleon coordinates, and using no
relative co-ordinates. The derivatives of the collective-rotation angle are
defined in terms of a combination of rigid and irrotational collective flows of
the nucleons. The collective wavefunction is chosen to be an eigenstate of the
angular momentum, yielding a MCRM Schrodinger equation for the intrinsic
wavefunction that contains a cranking Coriolis energy term that is linear in
the angular momentum and shear operators, a collective centrifugal energy term,
and a rotation-fluctuation energy term. In absence of the irrotational-flow
component and fluctuation energy term, the MCRM equation reduces to that of the
conventional cranking model (CCRM), but with a dynamic rigid-flow angular
velocity and rigid-flow centrifugal-energy term. The expectation of the angular
momentum operator, which is the sum of the collective rotation angular momentum
and the expectation of the angular momentum in the intrinsic state, would
reduce to that in the CCRM if the collective rotation angular momentum were
small. However, it is shown that, even for the simple case of the anisotropic
harmonic oscillator mean-field potential in , the collective rotation angular
momentum is not small in the current version of the MCRM, and that this problem
needs further study. It is also shown that the MCRM Schrodinger equation is
reducible to the equations of the particle-plus-rotor, phenomenological and
microscopic collective rotation-vibration, and two-fluid semi-classical
collective models.

showers of energies around $100\,$PeV and higher with an array of radio

and increases with the shower energy, radio measurements can be used to
determine the air-shower energy on an absolute scale. We show that calibrated
measurements of radio detectors operated in coincidence with host experiments
measuring air showers based on other techniques can be used for comparing the
energy scales of these host experiments. Using two approaches, first via direct
amplitude measurements, and second via comparison of measurements with air
shower simulations, we compare the energy scales of the air-shower experiments
Tunka-133 and KASCADE-Grande, using their radio extensions, Tunka-Rex and
LOPES, respectively. Due to the consistent amplitude calibration for Tunka-Rex
and LOPES achieved by using the same reference source, this comparison reaches
an accuracy of approximately $10\,\%$ - limited by some shortcomings of LOPES,
which was a prototype experiment for the digital radio technique for air
showers. In particular we show that the energy scales of cosmic-ray
measurements by the independently calibrated experiments KASCADE-Grande and
Tunka-133 are consistent with each other on this level.

of initial data, which grant short time uniqueness of the associated weak
Leray-Hopf solutions of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. In
particular, our main theorem that this holds for any solenodial initial data,
with finite $L_2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ norm, that also belongs to to certain subsets
of $VMO^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. As a corollary of this, we obtain the same
conclusion for any solenodial $u_{0}$ belonging to $L_{2}(\mathbb{R}^3)\cap
\mathbb{\dot{B}}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, for any
$3<p<\infty$. Here,
$\mathbb{\dot{B}}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ denotes the
closure of test functions in the critical Besov space
${\dot{B}}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. Our results rely on the
establishment of certain continuity properties near the initial time, for weak
Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, with these classes of
initial data. Such properties seem to be of independent interest. Consequently,
we are also able to show if a weak Leray-Hopf solution $u$ satisfies certain
extensions of the Prodi-Serrin condition on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times ]0,T[$, then
it is unique on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times ]0,T[$ amongst all other weak Leray-Hopf
solutions with the same initial value. In particular, we show this is the case

number of players $k\ge 2$. It has been an open question whether an analogue of
Raz's Parallel Repetition Theorem holds for games with more than two players,
i.e., whether the value of the repeated game decays exponentially with the
number of repetitions. Verbitsky has shown, via a reduction to the density
Hales-Jewett theorem, that the value of the repeated game must approach zero,
as the number of repetitions increases. However, the rate of decay obtained in
this way is extremely slow, and it is an open question whether the true rate is
exponential as is the case for all two-player games.
  Exponential decay bounds are known for several special cases of multi-player
games, e.g., free games and anchored games. In this work, we identify a certain
expansion property of the base game and show all games with this property
satisfy an exponential decay parallel repetition bound. Free games and anchored
games satisfy this expansion property, and thus our parallel repetition theorem
reproduces all earlier exponential-decay bounds for multiplayer games. More
generally, our parallel repetition bound applies to all multiplayer games that
are connected in a certain sense.
  We also describe a very simple game, called the GHZ game, that does not
satisfy this connectivity property, and for which we do not know an exponential
decay bound. We suspect that progress on bounding the value of this the
parallel repetition of the GHZ game will lead to further progress on the
general question.

the same phenomena in solid $^4$He and find quantitative agreement. Our results

redshift-space distortions (RSD) and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. In
Chapter 6, I place constraints of $f \sigma_8(0.76) = 0.44 \pm 0.04$ and $f
\sigma_8(1.05) = 0.28 \pm 0.08$, which remain consistent with GR at 95%

simultaneously constrained. The VIPERS v7 joint-posterior on $(f \sigma_8,
F_{AP})$ shows no compelling deviation from GR.
  Chapter 7 investigates the inclusion of a simple density transform:
`clipping' prior to the RSD analysis. This tackles the root-cause of
non-linearity and may extend the validity of perturbation theory. Moreover,
this marked statistic would amplify signatures of shielded modified gravity
models and includes information not available to the power spectrum. I show
that a linear real-space power spectrum with a Kaiser factor and a Lorentzian
damping yields a significant bias without clipping, but that this may be
removed with a strict threshold; similar behaviour is observed for the data.
Estimates of $f \sigma_8$ for different thresholds are highly correlated, but
this may be obtained using mocks. A maximum likelihood estimate from a
combination of thresholds is shown to achieve a 16% decrease in statistical
error relative to a single-threshold estimate. The results are encouraging to

hydrogen atoms can break interfacial Al-Si bonds, passivating a Si $sp^3$

be adsorbed at the interface on aluminum, forming stable Al-H-Al bridges. We
showed that hydrogenated O-H, Si-H and Al-H bonds at the Al/SiO$_2$ interfaces
are polarized. The resulting bond dipole weakens the O-H and Si-H bonds, but
strengthens the Al-H bond under the application of a positive bias at the metal

and modeling complex circular time series using the state space approach is
non-existent in the literature. In this article we introduce a flexible
Bayesian nonparametric approach to state space modeling of observed circular
time series where even the latent states are circular random variables.
Crucially, we assume that the forms of both observational and evolutionary
functions, both of which are circular in nature, are unknown and time-varying.
We model these unknown circular functions by appropriate wrapped Gaussian
processes having desirable properties.
  We develop an effective Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy for implementing
our Bayesian model, by judiciously combining Gibbs sampling and
Metropolis-Hastings methods. Validation of our ideas with a simulation study
and two real bivariate circular time series data sets, where we assume one of
the variables to be unobserved, revealed very encouraging performance of our
model and methods.
  We finally analyse a data consisting of directions of whale migration,
considering the unobserved ocean current direction as the latent circular

that interact on different topics. Some communities are characterized by what
are usually referred to as deviant behaviors, conducts that are commonly
considered inappropriate with respect to the society's norms or moral
standards. Eating disorders, drug use, and adult content consumption are just a
few examples. We refer to such communities as deviant networks. It is commonly
believed that such deviant networks are niche, isolated social groups, whose
activity is well separated from the mainstream social-media life. According to
this assumption, research studies have mostly considered them in isolation. In
this work we focused on adult content consumption networks, which are present
in many on-line social media and in the Web in general. We found that few small
and densely connected communities are responsible for most of the content
production. Differently from previous work, we studied how such communities
interact with the whole social network. We found that the produced content
flows to the rest of the network mostly directly or through bridge-communities,
reaching at least 450 times more users. We also show that a large fraction of
the users can be inadvertently exposed to such content through indirect content
resharing. We also discuss a demographic analysis of the producers and
consumers networks. Finally, we show that it is easily possible to identify a
few core users to radically uproot the diffusion process. We aim at setting the

fundamental problem in distributed computing. Considering that network
communication is the most expensive resource, efficiency is measured first of
all in terms of the communication needed to implement read and write
operations. It is well known that 2 communication round-trip phases involving
in total 4 message exchanges are sufficient to implemented atomic operations.
It is also known that under certain constraints on the number of readers with
respect to the numbers of replica servers and failures it is possible to
implement single-writer atomic objects such that each operation involves one
round-trip phase. We present algorithms that allow operations to complete in 3
communication exchanges without imposing any constraints on the number of
readers and writers. Specifically, we present an atomic memory implementation
for the SWMR setting, where reads complete in 3 communication exchanges and
writes complete in 2 exchanges. We pose the question of whether it is possible
to implement MWMR memory where operations complete in at most 3 communication
exchanges. We answer this question in the negative by showing that an atomic
memory implementation is impossible if both read and write operations take 3
communication exchanges, even when assuming two writers, two readers, and a
single replica server failure. Motivated by this impossibility result, we
provide a MWMR atomic memory implementation where reads involve 3 and writes 4
communication exchanges. In light of our impossibility result these algorithms
are optimal in terms of the number of communication exchanges. We rigorously
reason about the correctness of the algorithms.

abstracting away the states that are insignificant for the satisfaction of

plan synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized team planning and
full team synchronization after each agents' discrete step, and thus suffers
from extreme computational demands. We aim at reducing the computational
complexity by decomposing the plan synthesis problem into finite horizon
planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents. As
opposed to full synchronization, we introduce an event-based synchronization
that allows our approach to efficiently adapt to different time durations of

most studied young circumbinary disk. Observations of the dust continuum
emission at sub-mm/mm wavelengths detected a dust ring located between 200AU
and 300AU from the center of mass of the system. If the disk and the binary
orbit are coplanar, given the observed projected separation of the stars in the
binary system, the classical theory of tidal interaction between a binary
system and its circumbinary disk predicts a truncation radius which is
significantly smaller than the measured inner radius of the mm-sized dust ring.
We investigate the origin of this dust ring structure in the GG Tau A disk,
test whether the interaction between the binary and the disk can produce a dust
trap at the location of the observed ring, and discuss an alternative scenario
which invokes a misalignment between the disk and the stellar orbital planes.
We run a set of hydrodynamical simulations for an orbit consistent with the
astrometric solutions for the GG Tau A stellar proper motions, and for
different disk temperature and viscosities. We then apply a dust evolution
model in post-processing in order to to retrieve the distribution of mm-sized
grains. Comparing models and observations, we show that, if the binary orbit
and the disk were coplanar,the tidal truncation of the circumbinary disk would
occur at a radius that is too small compared to the inner edge inferred by the
dust observations, and that the pressure bump and the dust ring in the models
would be located at <150AU from the center of mass of the stellar system. This
shows that the GG Tau A disk cannot be coplanar with the binary orbital plane.
We also discuss the viability of the misaligned disk scenario, suggesting that
in order for dust trapping to occur at the observed radius, the disk and
orbital plane must be misaligned by an angle of about 25 degrees.

contain a free-surface. Conventional studies on stratified shear instabilities
make Boussinesq approximation. Free-surface arising due to large density
variations between air and water cannot be taken into consideration under this
approximation. Hence the free-surface is usually replaced by a rigid-lid, and
therefore has little effect on the stability of the fluid below it. In this
paper we have performed non-Boussinesq linear stability analyses of a double
circulation velocity profile prevalent in two-layered density stratified lakes.
One of our analyses is performed by considering the presence of wind, while the
other one considers quiescent air. Both analyses have shown similar growth
rates and stability boundaries. We have compared our non-Boussinesq study with
a corresponding Boussinesq one. The maximum non-Boussinesq growth rate is found
to be an order of magnitude greater than the maximum Boussinesq growth rate.
Furthermore, the stability curves in these two studies are very different. The
non-Boussinesq instability as well as the Boussinseq one can become three
dimensional in some sub-ranges of the bulk Richardson number. An analytical
study has also been conducted on a simple broken-line profile representing
double circulation in order to complement the numerical stability analysis. The
analytical growth rates are in good agreement with the non-Boussinesq numerical
growth rates observed in continuous profiles. The physical mechanism behind
this non-Boussinesq instability is the resonant interaction between a surface
vorticity-gravity wave existing at the free-surface (air-water interface), and
an interfacial vorticity-gravity wave existing at the pycnocline (warm and cold
water interface). We expect similar kind of non-Boussinesq instability to occur

process with open boundaries. This model possesses the property of being
integrable and appears as physically relevant because the boundary conditions
can be interpreted as the interaction with particles reservoirs with fixed
densities of each species. The system is driven out-of-equilibrium by these
reservoirs. The steady state is analytically computed in a matrix product form.
This algebraic structure allows us to obtain exact expressions for the mean
particle currents and for the one and two-point correlation functions. An
additivity principle is also derived from the matrix ansatz and permits the
computation of the large deviation functional of the density profile. We also
propose a description of the model in the context of the macroscopic
fluctuation theory and we check the consistency with the exact computations
from the finite size lattice.

Lam\'e parameters of multiple inclusions in a homogeneous background elastic
material using a few measurements of the displacement field over a finite
collection of boundary points. The algorithm does not require any linearization
or iterative update of Green's function but still allows very accurate
reconstruction. The breakthrough comes from a novel interpretation of
Lippmann-Schwinger type integral representation of the displacement field in
terms of unknown densities having common sparse support on the location of
inclusions. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm consists of a two-step
approach. First, the localization problem is recast as a joint sparse recovery
problem that renders the densities and the inclusion support simultaneously.
Then, a noise robust constrained optimization problem is formulated for the
reconstruction of elastic parameters. An efficient algorithm is designed for
numerical implementation using the Multiple Sparse Bayesian Learning (M-SBL)
for joint sparse recovery problem and the Constrained Split Augmented
Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (C-SALSA) for the constrained optimization
problem. The efficacy of the proposed framework is manifested through extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
algorithm tailored for parameter reconstruction problems in elastic media using
highly under-sampled data in the sense of Nyquist rate.

non-unified EoSs widely used in the literature, i.e. APR and GM1 EoS, which are
commonly matched with the Negele-Vautherin and the Baym-Pethick-Sutherland
crust EoS. All the core EoSs satisfy the recent observational constraints of
the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely measured. We show that the
NS mass-equatorial radius relations are slightly affected by the smoothness at
the core-crust matching interface. Moreover, the uncertainties in the crust EoS
and the matching interface bring insignificant changes, even at maximally
rotating (Keplerian) configurations. We also find that for all four unified
EoSs, rotation can increase the star's gravitational mass up to $18\%-19\%$ and
the equatorial radius by $29\%-36\%$, which are consistent with the previous
calculations using non-unified EoSs. For stars as heavy as 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, the
radius increase is more pronounced, reaching $41\%-43\%$, i.e. $5-6$ km.
Moreover, by confronting the results using unified EoSs, which give the correct
empirical values at saturation density, with two controversial determinations
of the radius for the fast rotator 4U 1608-52, we address that a small radius
may be better justified for this source.

by sites (cities, car-rental agencies, parking lots, etc.) and connected by
two-way arteries (roads, highways), that allow forecasting the vehicular flux
in a sequence of $n$ consecutive steps, or units of time. An essential approach
consists in using, as an ""a priori"" information, previous observations and
measurements. The formal tools used in our analysis consists in: (1)
associating a digraph to the network where the edges correspond to arteries and
the vertices with loops represent the sites. (2) From an initial set of
numbers, that are the distribution of vehicles within the network, we construct
a matrix that we transform into a stochastic matrix (SM) by normalizing the
rows, whose entries are now transition probabilities. This matrix becomes the
generator of the evolution of the traffic flow. And (3), we use the
Perron-Frobenius theory for a formal analysis. We investigate three models: (a)
a closed four-site network having a conserved number of vehicles; (b) to this
network we add an influx and an outflux of vehicles to characterize an open
system; asymptotically, $n \rightarrow \infty$, the SM raised to the power $n$
goes to a unique stationary matrix. And (c), we construct a nonlinear model
because the formal structure permits the existence of several ($L$) stationary
states for the distribution of vehicles at each site, that alternate cyclically
with time. Each state represents the traffic for $L$ different moments. These
models were used to analyze the traffic in a sector of the city of Tigre,
located in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results are presented

due to the difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary
surface and the number of degrees of freedom in a bulk region. Now, a natural
question arises that how these degrees of freedom are emerged from nothing? We
try to address this issue in a new theory which is more complete than M-theory
and reduces to it with some limitations. In M-theory, there isn't any stable
object like stable M3-branes that our universe is formed on it and for this
reason can't help us to explain cosmological events. In this research, we
propose a new theory, named G -theory which could be the mother of M-theory and
superstring theory. In G-theory, at the beginning, two types of G0-branes, one
with positive energy and one with negative energy are produced from nothing in
fourteen dimensions. Then, these branes are compactified on three circles via
two different ways (symmetrically and anti-symmetrically), and two bosonic and
fermionic parts of action for M0-branes are produced. By joining M0-branes,
supersymmetric Mp-branes are created which contain the equal number of degrees
of freedom for fermions and bosons. Our universe is constructed on one of
Mp-branes and other Mp-brane and extra energy play the role of bulk. By
dissolving extra energy which is produced by compacting actions of Gp-branes,
into our universe, the number of degrees of freedom on it and also it's scale
factor increase and universe expands. We test G-theory with observations and
find that the the magnitude of the slow-roll parameters and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio in this model are very smaller than one which are in
agreement with predictions of experimental data. Finally, we consider the
origin of the extended theories of gravity in G-theory and show that these
theories could be anomaly free.
