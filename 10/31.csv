studied in nuclear matter by using the in-medium QCD sum rules. By fixing the

parameters of the $\Delta$ baryon are more affected by the medium against the
$\Omega^{-}$ state, containing three strange quarks, whose mass and residue do

Therefore M-dwarf planetary systems with a known transiting planet are expected
to contain additional small planets ($r_p \le 4$ R$_{\oplus}$, $m_p \lesssim
20$ M$_{\oplus}$) that are not seen in transit. In this study we investigate
the effort required to detect such planets using precision velocimetry around
the sizable subset of M-dwarfs which are slowly rotating ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}
\gtrsim 40$ days) and hence more likely to be inactive. We focus on the test
case of GJ 1132. Specifically, we perform a suite of Monte-Carlo simulations of
the star's radial velocity signal featuring astrophysical contributions from
stellar jitter due to rotationally modulated active regions and keplarian
signals from the known transiting planet and hypothetical additional planets
not seen in transit. We then compute the detection completeness of
non-transiting planets around GJ 1132 and consequently estimate the number of
RV measurements required to detect those planets. We show that with 1 m
s$^{-1}$ RV precision per measurement, only $\sim 50$ measurements are required
to achieve a 50\% detection completeness to all non-transiting planets in the
system and to planets which are potentially habitable. Throughout we advocate
the use of Gaussian process regression as an effective tool for mitigating the
effects of stellar jitter including stars with high activity. Given that GJ
1132 is representative of a large population of slowly rotating M-dwarfs, we
conclude with a discussion of how our results may be extended to other systems
with known transiting planets such as those which will be discovered with TESS.

belt region compared with elsewhere in the solar system. Observational surveys
also indicate a deficit in the number of small ($ \le 50$~km size) asteroids
that is two orders of magnitude lower than what is expected from the single
power-law distribution that results from a collisional coagulation and
fragmentation equilibrium. Here, we consider the possibility that a major
fraction of the original asteroid population may have been cleared out by
Jupiter's secular resonance, as it swept through the main asteroid belt during
the depletion of the solar nebula. This effect leads to the excitation of the
asteroids' orbital eccentricities. Concurrently, hydrodynamic drag and
planet-disk tidal interaction effectively damp the eccentricities of sub-100
km-size and of super-lunar-size planetesimals, respectively. These combined
effects lead to the asteroids' orbital decay and clearing from the present-day
main belt region ($\sim 2.1-3.3$~AU). The intermediate-size (50 to several
hundreds of kilometers) planetesimals therefore preferentially remain as main
belt asteroids near their birthplaces, with modest asymptotic eccentricities.
The smaller asteroids are the fragments of subsequent disruptive collisions at
later times as suggested by the present-day asteroid families. This scenario
provides a natural explanation for both the observed low surface density and
the size distribution of asteroids in the main belt. It also offers an
explanation for the confined spatial extent of the terrestrial planet building
blocks without the requirement of extensive migration of Jupiter.

modifications of contact structures which are higher-dimensional
generalizations of the $3$-dimensional Lutz twists are introduced. One of the
operations makes a contact manifold overtwisted in any dimension. Another one
makes it weakly symplectically non-fillable. And the other one makes it
strongly symplectically non-fillable. In other words, they make the overtwisted
disc, the bordered Legendrian open books, and the Giroux domains, respectively.
The first two modifications can be realized by sequences of contact round

easily. Further, a version of the first operation keeps the homotopy classes of
contact structures as almost contact structures, and the other version
contributes to the Euler classes of contact structures.

two classes, existential and universal. This forms the basic arena for a
plethora of infinite duration two-player games where Player~$\square$
and~$\ocircle$ alternate in a turn-based sliding of a pebble along the arcs
they control. We study alternating strongly-connectedness as a generalization
of strongly-connectedness in directed graphs, aiming at providing a linear time
decomposition and a sound structural graph characterization. For this a refined
notion of alternating reachability is introduced: Player~$\square$ attempts to
reach vertices without leaving a prescribed subset of the vertices, while
Player~$\ocircle$ works against. This is named \emph{safe alternating
reachability}. It is shown that every arena uniquely decomposes into safe
alternating strongly-connected components where Player~$\square$ can visit each
vertex within a given component infinitely often, without having to ever leave
out the component itself. Our main result is a linear time algorithm for
computing this alternating graph decomposition. Both the underlying graph
structures and the algorithm generalize the classical decomposition of a
directed graph into strongly-connected components. The algorithm builds on a
linear time generalization of the depth-first search on alternation, taking
inspiration from Tarjan 1972 machinery. Our theory has direct applications in
solving well-known infinite duration pebble games faster. Dinneen and
Khoussainov showed in 1999 that deciding a given Update Game costs $O(mn)$

properties can be achieved through appropriate dynamic homogenization of
composites. This homogenization is almost always done for infinite domains and
the results are then applied to finite samples. This process ignores the
evanescent waves which appear at the boundaries of such finite samples. In this
paper we first clarify the emergence and purpose of these evanescent waves in a
model problem consisting of an interface between a layered composite and a
homogeneous medium. We show that these evanescent waves form boundary layers on
either side of the interface beyond which the composite can be represented by
appropriate infinite domain homogenized relations. We show that if one ignores
the boundary layers then the displacement and stress fields are discontinuous
across the interface. Therefore, the scattering coefficients at such an
interface cannot be determined through the conventional continuity conditions
involving only propagating modes. Here we propose an approximate variational
approach for sidestepping these boundary layers. The aim is to determine the
scattering coefficients without the knowledge of evanescent modes. Through
various numerical examples we show that our technique gives very good estimates
of the actual scattering coefficients beyond the long wavelength limit.

simulations, we show how photo-$z$ errors modify the amplitude of moments of
the 2D power spectrum, their variances, the amplitude of BAO, and the
cosmological information in them. We find that: a) photo-$z$ errors suppress
the clustering on small scales, increasing the relative importance of shot
noise, and thus reducing the interval of scales available for BAO analyses; b)
photo-$z$ errors decrease the smearing of BAO due to non-linear redshift-space
distortions (RSD) by giving less weight to line-of-sight modes; and c)
photo-$z$ errors (and small-scale RSD) induce a scale dependence on the
information encoded in the BAO scale, and that reduces the constraining power
on the Hubble parameter. Using these findings, we propose a template that
extracts unbiased cosmological information from samples with photo-$z$ errors
with respect to cases without them. Finally, we provide analytic expressions to
forecast the precision in measuring the BAO scale, showing that
spectro-photometric surveys will measure the expansion history of the Universe
with a precision competitive to that of spectroscopic surveys.

L^\infty$ theory of Yudovich, the $L^1$ assumption can be dropped upon having
an appropriate symmetry condition. This contains a class of radially
homogeneous solutions to the 2D Euler equation, which gives rise to a new 1D
fluid model. We discuss several interesting properties of this 1D system. Using
this framework, we construct time quasi-periodic solutions to the 2D Euler
equation exhibiting pendulum-like behavior. We also exhibit solutions with
compact support for which angular derivatives grow linearly in time or
exponential in time (the latter being in the presence of a boundary). A similar
study can be done for the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation. Using the
same symmetry condition, we prove local existence and uniqueness of solutions
which are merely Lipschitz continuous near the origin - though, without the
symmetry, Lipschitz initial data is expected to lose its Lipschitz continuity
immediately. Once more, a special class of radially homogeneous solutions is
considered and we extract a 1D model which bears great resemblance to the
so-called De Gregorio model. We then show that finite-time singularity
formation for the 1D model implies finite-time singularity formation in the
class of Lipschitz solutions to the SQG equation which are compact support.
While the study of special infinite energy solutions to fluid models is
classical, this appears to be the first case where they can be embedded into a
natural existence/uniqueness class for the equation. Moreover, these special
solutions approximate finite-energy solutions for long time and have a direct
bearing on the global regularity problem for finite-energy solutions.

Health Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can

main objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible

been proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does
not rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,
but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health

human-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a

addition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the
state-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the
most sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting
patient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers of
de-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.

the state variables. This full correlation structure possess the limitation to
have fully analytical pricing formula for hybrid models of variance swaps, due
to the non-affinity property embedded in the model itself. We address this
issue by obtaining an efficient semi-closed form pricing formula of variance
swaps for an approximation of the hybrid model via the derivation of

evaluate the accuracy of our pricing formula. Our findings confirmed that the

complex behavioural patterns that can be exhibited by even the simplest

Orthodox study of the evolution of these simple networks has generally been
limited in its ability to explain complexity, since it restricts evolutionary
adaptation to an inertia-free process with few degrees of freedom in which only
gradual, moderately complex behaviours are possible. We propose a model
inspired by particle mediated field phenomena in classical physics in
combination with fundamental concepts in adaptation, that suggests that small
but high-dimensional chaotic dynamics near to the adaptive trait optimum could
help explain complex properties shared by most ecological datasets, such as
aperiodicity and pink, fractal noise spectra. By examining a simple
predator-prey model and appealing to real ecological data, we show that this
type of complexity could be easily confused for or confounded by stochasticity,
especially when spurred on or amplified by stochastic factors that share
variational and spectral properties with the underlying dynamics.

approximation of the log-likelihood coupled with a subsampling approach. A key
feature of the proposed algorithm is its parallelizability, by processing
portions of the data on several cores, while leveraging communication of key
statistics across the cores during each iteration of the algorithm. The
performance of the algorithm is evaluated on synthetic data sets and compared
with competing methods for blockmodel parameter estimation. We also illustrate
the model on data from a Facebook derived social network enhanced with node
covariate information.

observing the outcome of each arm is expensive, but cheap approximations to
this outcome are available. For example, in online advertising the performance
of an ad can be approximated by displaying it for shorter time periods or to
narrower audiences. We formalise this task as a multi-fidelity bandit, where,
at each time step, the forecaster may choose to play an arm at any one of $M$
fidelities. The highest fidelity (desired outcome) expends cost
$\lambda^{(m)}$. The $m^{\text{th}}$ fidelity (an approximation) expends
$\lambda^{(m)} < \lambda^{(M)}$ and returns a biased estimate of the highest
fidelity. We develop MF-UCB, a novel upper confidence bound procedure for this
setting and prove that it naturally adapts to the sequence of available
approximations and costs thus attaining better regret than naive strategies
which ignore the approximations. For instance, in the above online advertising
example, MF-UCB would use the lower fidelities to quickly eliminate suboptimal
ads and reserve the larger expensive experiments on a small set of promising
candidates. We complement this result with a lower bound and show that MF-UCB
is nearly optimal under certain conditions.

function and $\mathbf X = (X_1,\dots,X_d)$ is a random vector with known
marginal distributions and partially known dependence structure. More
specifically, we analyze three types of available information on the dependence
structure: First, we consider the case where extreme value information, such as
the distributions of partial minima and maxima of $\mathbf X$, is available. In
order to include this information in the computation of Value-at-Risk bounds,
we utilize a reduction principle that relates this problem to an optimization
problem over a standard Fr\'echet class, which can then be solved by means of
the rearrangement algorithm or using analytical results. Second, we assume that
the copula of $\mathbf X$ is known on a subset of its domain, and finally we
consider the case where the copula of $\mathbf X$ lies in the vicinity of a
reference copula as measured by a statistical distance. In order to derive
Value-at-Risk bounds in the latter situations, we first improve the
Fr\'echet--Hoeffding bounds on copulas so as to include this additional
information on the dependence structure. Then, we translate the improved
Fr\'echet--Hoeffding bounds to bounds on the Value-at-Risk using the so-called
improved standard bounds. In numerical examples we illustrate that the
additional information typically leads to a significant improvement of the

should be reduced for routine patient scanning. However, in low-dose X-ray CT,
severe artifacts usually occur due to photon starvation, beamhardening, etc,
which decrease the reliability of diagnosis. Thus, high quality reconstruction
from low-dose X-ray CT data has become one of the important research topics in
CT community. Conventional model-based denoising approaches are, however,
computationally very expensive, and image domain denoising approaches hardly
deal with CT specific noise patterns. To address these issues, we propose an
algorithm using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which is applied to
wavelet transform coefficients of low-dose CT images. Specifically, by using a
directional wavelet transform for extracting directional component of artifacts
and exploiting the intra- and inter-band correlations, our deep network can
effectively suppress CT specific noises. Moreover, our CNN is designed to have
various types of residual learning architecture for faster network training and
better denoising. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm
effectively removes complex noise patterns of CT images, originated from the
reduced X-ray dose. In addition, we show that wavelet domain CNN is efficient
in removing the noises from low-dose CT compared to an image domain CNN. Our
results were rigorously evaluated by several radiologists and won the second
place award in 2016 AAPM Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first deep learning architecture for low-dose CT
reconstruction that has been rigorously evaluated and proven for its efficacy.

local scalar interaction is investigated for various values and momentum
dependence of the scalar Landau parameter $f_0$ in the particle-hole channel.
For $f_0 >0$ the conditions are found when the phase velocity on the spectrum
of the zero sound acquires a minimum at a non-zero momentum. For $-1<f_0 <0$
there are only damped excitations, and for $f_0<-1$ the spectrum becomes
unstable against a growth of scalar-mode excitations. An effective Lagrangian
for the scalar excitation modes is derived after performing a bosonization
procedure. We demonstrate that the instability may be tamed by the formation of
a static Bose condensate of the scalar modes. The condensation may occur in a
homogeneous or inhomogeneous state relying on the momentum dependence of the
scalar Landau parameter. We show that in the isospin-symmetric nuclear matter
there may appear a metastable state at a subsaturation nuclear density owing to
the condensate. Then we consider a possibility of the condensation of the
zero-sound-like excitations in a state with a non-zero momentum in Fermi
liquids moving with overcritical velocities, provided an appropriate momentum
dependence of the Landau parameter $f_0 (k)>0$. We also argue that in

In this work
we show that density functional theory, for the first time, uncovers universal
behaviors for phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems. To be
specific, we first prove that the non-degenerate steady state of a
non-Hermitian quantum many-body system is a universal function of the first
derivative of the steady state energy with respect to the control parameter.
This finding has far-reaching consequences for non-Hermitian systems: (i) It
bridges the nonanalytic behavior in physical observable and nonanalytic
behavior of steady state energy, which explains why the quantum phase
transitions in non-Hermitian systems occur for finite systems. (ii) It predicts
universal scaling behaviors of any physical observable at non-Hermitian phase
transition point with scaling exponent being
$(1-1/p),2(1-1/p),\cdots,n(1-1/p),\cdots$ with $p$ being the number of
coalesced states at the exceptional point and $n$ being a positive integer.
(iii). It reveals that quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian phase transition
point presents universal scaling behaviors with critical exponents being
$(1-1/p),2(1-1/p),\cdots,n(1-1/p),\cdots$. These results uncover universal
critical behaviors in non-Hermitian phase transitions and provide profound
connections between entanglement and phase transition in non-Hermitian quantum

and memory systems remain unclear and difficult to evaluate.
  In this paper we design and implement the ARAPrototyper to enable rapid
design space explorations for ARAs in real silicons and reduce the tedious
prototyping efforts far down to manageable efforts. First, ARAPrototyper
provides a reusable baseline prototype with a highly customizable memory
system, including interconnect between accelerators and buffers, interconnect
between buffers and last-level cache (LLC) or DRAM, coherency choice at LLC or
DRAM, and address translation support. Second, ARAPrototyper provides a clean
interface to quickly integrate users' own accelerators written in high-level
synthesis (HLS) code. The whole design flow is highly automated to generate a
prototype of ARA on an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC). Third, to quickly develop
applications that run seamlessly on the ARA prototype, ARAPrototyper provides a
system software stack, abstracts the accelerators as software libraries, and
provides APIs for software developers. Our experimental results demonstrate
that ARAPrototyper enables a wide range of design space explorations for ARAs
at manageable prototyping efforts, which has 4,000X to 10,000X faster
evaluation time than full-system simulations. We believe that ARAPrototyper can

underlying assumption in all existing distance measures is that feature
elements are independent and identically distributed. However, in real-world
settings, data generally originate from heterogeneous sources even if they do
possess a common data-generating mechanism. Since these sources are not
identically distributed by necessity, the assumption of identical distribution
is inappropriate. Here, we use statistical analysis to show that feature
elements of local image descriptors are indeed non-identically distributed. To
test the effect of omitting the unified distribution assumption, we created a
new distance measure called the Poisson-Binomial Radius (PBR). PBR is a
bin-to-bin distance which accounts for the dispersion of bin-to-bin
information. PBR's performance was evaluated on twelve benchmark data sets
covering six different classification and recognition applications: texture,
material, leaf, scene, ear biometrics and category-level image classification.
Results from these experiments demonstrate that PBR outperforms
state-of-the-art distance measures for most of the data sets and achieves
comparable performance on the rest, suggesting that accounting for different
distributions in distance measures can improve performance in classification
and recognition tasks.

recovering multiple erasures. We define the (n,k,r,t)-SLRC (Sequential Locally
Repairable Codes) as an [n,k] linear code where any t'(>= t) erasures can be
sequentially recovered, each one by r (2<=r<k) other code symbols. Sequential
recovering means that the erased symbols are recovered one by one, and an
already recovered symbol can be used to recover the remaining erased symbols.
This important recovering method, in contrast with the vastly studied parallel
recovering, is currently far from understanding, say, lacking codes constructed
for arbitrary t>=3 erasures and bounds to evaluate the performance of such
codes.
  We first derive a tight upper bound on the code rate of (n, k, r, t)-SLRC for
t=3 and r>=2. We then propose two constructions of binary (n, k, r, t)-SLRCs
for general r,t>=2 (Existing constructions are dealing with t<=7 erasures. The
first construction generalizes the method of direct product construction. The
second construction is based on the resolvable configurations and yields SLRCs

are observed on the HK0 reciprocal space plane. Electrical poling along the

with the parallel-to-the-field components enhanced while the
perpendicular-to-the-field components suppressed. Several low energy phonon
branches along the [001] and [111] directions were studied. Most significantly,
the PNR-acoustic phonon coupling is confirmed for the [110] transverse acoustic
(TA) phonons polarized along the [1-10] real space direction and the [100] TA
phonons. This coupling appears to be anisotropic and correlated with the
distribution of PNRs, and also affected by the relative length scales of the
PNRs and phonon wave vectors. The well-known 'waterfall' phenomenon is observed
on the [001] and [110] transverse optical (TO) branches, near the zone center.
The optical phonon measurements also reveal a lowest-energy, zone center soft

avoiding immediate repetitions and alternating subsequences with length $s+2$.
The main problem is to determine the maximum length of such a sequence, as a
function of $n$ and $s$. When $s$ is fixed this problem has been settled but
when $s$ is a function of $n$, very little is known about the extremal function
$\lambda(s,n)$ of such sequences.
  In this paper we give a new recursive construction of Davenport-Schinzel
sequences that is based on dense 0-1 matrices avoiding large all-1 submatrices
(aka Zarankiewicz's Problem.) In particular, we give a simple construction of
$n^{2/t} \times n$ matrices containing $n^{1+1/t}$ 1s that avoid $t\times 2$
all-1 submatrices.
  Our lower bounds on $\lambda(s,n)$ exhibit three qualitatively different
behaviors depending on the size of $s$ relative to $n$. When $s \le \log\log n$
we show that $\lambda(s,n)/n \ge 2^s$ grows exponentially with $s$. When $s =
n^{o(1)}$ we show $\lambda(s,n)/n \ge (\frac{s}{2\log\log_s n})^{\log\log_s n}$
grows faster than any polynomial in $s$. Finally, when
$s=\Omega(n^{1/t}(t-1)!)$, $\lambda(s,n) = \Omega(n^2 s/(t-1)!)$ matches the
trivial upper bound $O(n^2s)$ asymptotically, whenever $t$ is constant.

unique dynamical tests of the Kerr metric of the massive black hole (MBH)
orbited by them. In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the
related relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the
gravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is
quite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a
typical target star, i.e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to
both the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a
single or a cluster of disturbing object(s). We find that, in most cases, the
Newtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the
perturbed orbital period of the target star, rather than the Newtonian orbital
precessions. The Newtonian perturbations have their unique features when they
peak around the pericenter passage in each revolution, which is quite different
from those of the spin-induced effects. Looking at the currently detected star
S2/S0-2, we find that its spin-induced effects on both the image position and
redshift are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the
star S0-102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations
on a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of the currently detected
ones. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the
central MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and
the redshift dominate over the stellar perturbations for target stars with
orbital semimajor axis smaller than $100-400$AU if the MBH is maximally
spinning. Our results suggest that, in principle, the stellar perturbations can
be removed as they have distinctive morphologies comparing to those of the

bit channels ($\mathcal{F}$), and the undetermined bit channels
($\mathcal{U}$), are selected by applying PO relations. The POs are channel
independent and are therefore universal for all binary-input discrete
memoryless channels. For a given specific channel, a new process, called
Dimension Reduction (DR), is proposed in this paper to further reduce the size
of $\mathcal{U}$. Our studies show that for $N=10$ and the code rate $R=0.5$
(being the worst code rate), incorporating PO relations alone can determine 50%
of the bit channels ($|\mathcal{I}| + |\mathcal{F}| \approx N/2$). With our
proposed DR, this number of the determined bit channels goes up to 82%, which
brings a significant reduction of computations in the construction of polar
codes.

add every edge and arc in $M$ a Randi\'c weight, then we can get a new weighted

Motivated by this, we define the Hermitian-Randi\'c matrix
$R_{H}(M)=(r_{h})_{kl}$ of a mixed graph $M$, where
$(r_{h})_{kl}=-(r_{h})_{lk}=\frac{\textbf{i}}{\sqrt{d_{k}d_{l}}}$

$(r_{h})_{kl}=(r_{h})_{lk}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}d_{l}}}$ if $v_{k}v_{l}$ is an
undirected edge of $M$, and $(r_{h})_{kl}=0$ otherwise.
  In this paper, firstly, we compute the characteristic polynomial of the
Hermitian-Randi\'c matrix of a mixed graph. Furthermore, we give bounds to the
Hermitian-Randi\'c energy of a general mixed graph. Finally, we give some

the transmitter uses Reaction Shift Keying (RSK) as the modulation scheme. We
focus on the demodulation of RSK signal at the receiver. The receiver consists
of a front-end molecular circuit and a back-end demodulator. The front-end
molecular circuit is a set of chemical reactions consisting of multiple
chemical species. The optimal demodulator computes the posteriori probability
of the transmitted symbols given the history of the observation. The derivation
of the optimal demodulator requires the solution to a specific Bayesian
filtering problem. The solution to this Bayesian filtering problem had been
derived for a few specific molecular circuits and specific choice(s) of
observed chemical species. The derivation of such solution is also lengthy. The
key contribution of this paper is to present a general solution to this
Bayesian filtering problem which can be applied to any molecular circuit and
any choice of observed species.

the readers to click on an article and subsequently visit the media site, the
outlets often come up with catchy headlines accompanying the article links,
which lure the readers to click on the link. Such headlines are known as
Clickbaits. While these baits may trick the readers into clicking, in the long
run, clickbaits usually don't live up to the expectation of the readers, and
leave them disappointed.
  In this work, we attempt to automatically detect clickbaits and then build a
browser extension which warns the readers of different media sites about the
possibility of being baited by such headlines. The extension also offers each
reader an option to block clickbaits she doesn't want to see. Then, using such

Using an embedding technique to facilitate comparisons, we show that the

elevated stem pressure in response to repeated daily freeze-thaw cycles, gives
rise to an interesting multi-scale problem involving heat and multiphase
liquid/gas transport. The pressure generation mechanism is a cellular-level
process that is governed by differential equations for sap transport through
porous cell membranes, phase change, heat transport, and generation of osmotic
pressure. By assuming a periodic cellular structure based on an appropriate
reference cell, we derive an homogenized heat equation governing the global
temperature on the scale of the tree stem, with all the remaining physics
relegated to equations defined on the reference cell. We derive a corresponding
strong formulation of the limit problem and use it to design an efficient
numerical solution algorithm. Numerical simulations are then performed to
validate the results and draw conclusions regarding the phenomenon of sap
exudation, which is of great importance in trees such as sugar maple and a few
other related species. The particular form of our homogenized temperature
equation is obtained using periodic homogenization techniques with two-scale
convergence, which we investigate theoretically in the context of a simpler
two-phase Stefan-type problem corresponding to a periodic array of melting
cylindrical ice bars with a constant thermal diffusion coefficient. For this
reduced model, we prove results on existence, uniqueness and convergence of the
two-scale limit solution in the weak form, clearly identifying the missing
pieces required to extend the proofs to the fully nonlinear sap exudation
model. Numerical simulations of the reduced equations are then compared with

problem which generalizes many well known problems, has applications in various
fields, and can be solved in polynomial time. Owing to applications in computer
vision and machine learning, fast SFM algorithms are highly desirable. The
current fastest algorithms [Lee, Sidford, Wong, FOCS 2015] run in $O(n^{2}\log
nM\cdot\textrm{EO} +n^{3}\log^{O(1)}nM)$ time and $O(n^{3}\log^{2}n\cdot
\textrm{EO} +n^{4}\log^{O(1)}n$) time respectively, where $M$ is the largest
absolute value of the function (assuming the range is integers) and
$\textrm{EO}$ is the time taken to evaluate the function on any set. Although
the best known lower bound on the query complexity is only $\Omega(n)$, the
current shortest non-deterministic proof certifying the optimum value of a
function requires $\Theta(n^{2})$ function evaluations.
  The main contribution of this paper are subquadratic SFM algorithms. For
integer-valued submodular functions, we give an SFM algorithm which runs in
$O(nM^{3}\log n\cdot\textrm{EO})$ time giving the first nearly linear time
algorithm in any known regime. For real-valued submodular functions with range
in $[-1,1]$, we give an algorithm which in
$\tilde{O}(n^{5/3}\cdot\textrm{EO}/\varepsilon^{2})$ time returns an
$\varepsilon$-additive approximate solution. At the heart of it, our algorithms
are projected stochastic subgradient descent methods on the Lovasz extension of
submodular functions where we crucially exploit submodularity and data
structures to obtain fast, i.e. sublinear time subgradient updates. . The
latter is crucial for beating the $n^{2}$ bound as we show that algorithms
which access only subgradients of the Lovasz extension, and these include the
theoretically best algorithms mentioned above, must make $\Omega(n)$

improvement on estimators found after preliminary data-based model selection.
The key result of Efron (2014) is a very convenient and widely applicable
formula for a delta method approximation to the standard deviation of the
bootstrap smoothed estimator. This approximation provides an easily computed
guide to the accuracy of this estimator. In addition, Efron (2014) proposed a
confidence interval centered on the bootstrap smoothed estimator, with width
proportional to the estimate of this approximation to the standard deviation.
We evaluate this confidence interval in the scenario of two nested linear
regression models, the full model and a simpler model, and a preliminary test
of the null hypothesis that the simpler model is correct. We derive
computationally convenient expressions for the ideal bootstrap smoothed
estimator and the coverage probability and expected length of this confidence
interval. In terms of coverage probability, this confidence interval
outperforms the post-model-selection confidence interval with the same nominal
coverage and based on the same preliminary test. We also compare the
performance of confidence interval centered on the bootstrap smoothed
estimator, in terms of expected length, to the usual confidence interval, with
the same minimum coverage probablility, based on the full model.

explain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the Hoyle state of

revealed that the previously undetermined three-body parameter introduced in

derivative of selective reflection signal with a frequency position coinciding
with atomic transitions was used in measurements, providing $\sim$ 40 MHz
spectral resolution and linearity of signal response in respect to transition
probability. Behavior of 28 individual Zeeman transitions in a wide range of
longitudinal magnetic field (0 - 6 kG) has been tracked under excitation of Cs

hyperfine Paschen-Back regime. The obtained experimental results are consistent
with numerical modeling. Due to small divergence of selective reflection
signal, as well as sub-wavelength thickness and sub-Doppler spectral linewidth
inherent to nanocell, the employed technique can be used for distant remote

($EM=n^2L^3$) and temperature ($T$) at the flare peak. Here, $n$ is the coronal
electron density of the flares. This scaling law enables the estimation of $B$
and $L$ for unresolved stellar flares from the observable physical quantities
$EM$ and $T$, which is helpful for studying stellar surface activities. To
apply this scaling law to stellar flares, we discuss its validity for spatially
resolved solar flares. $EM$ and $T$ were calculated from GOES soft X-ray flux
data, and $B$ and $L$ are theoretically estimated using the scaling law. For
the same flare events, $B$ and $L$ were also observationally estimated with
images taken by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/ Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) Magnetogram and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 94{\AA} pass

and observationally estimated values. We interpret this result as indirect
evidence that flares are caused by magnetic reconnection. Moreover, this
analysis makes us confident in the validity of applying this scaling law to
stellar flares as well as solar flares.

matches the one of Electromagnetism and is free of additional terms even for a

then search for scalar invariant quantities in analogy to Electromagnetism. We
define three novel, 3rd-rank gravitational tensors, and demonstrate that the

shell can give rise to bright emission as it gradually becomes transparent to

expected emission from the optically thick shell, in which photons in the shell
gradually diffuse out to the interstellar space. Then, we investigate the
possibility that radiation powered by the hydrodynamical interaction is the

generalize $(X,\varphi,*\varphi)$ to 'tamed almost $G_2$-manifolds'
$(X,\varphi,\psi)$, where we compare $\varphi$ with $\omega$ and $\psi$ with
$J$. Associative 3-folds in $X$, a special kind of minimal submanifold, are
analogous to $J$-holomorphic curves in $Y$.
  Several areas of Symplectic Geometry -- Gromov-Witten theory, Quantum
Cohomology, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, Fukaya categories -- are built using
'counts' of moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves in $Y$, but give an answer
depending only on the symplectic manifold $(Y,\omega)$, not on the (almost)
complex structure $J$.
  We investigate whether it may be possible to define interesting invariants of
tamed almost $G_2$-manifolds $(X,\varphi,\psi)$ by 'counting' compact
associative 3-folds $N\subset X$, such that the invariants depend only on
$\varphi$, and are independent of the 4-form $\psi$ used to define associative
3-folds.
  We conjecture that one can define a superpotential $\Phi_\psi:{\mathcal
U}\to\Lambda_{>0}$ 'counting' associative $\mathbb Q$-homology 3-spheres
$N\subset X$ which is deformation-invariant in $\psi$ for $\varphi$ fixed, up
to certain reparametrizations $\Upsilon:{\mathcal U}\to{\mathcal U}$ of the
base ${\mathcal U}=$Hom$(H_3(X;{\mathbb Z}),1+\Lambda_{>0})$, where
$\Lambda_{>0}$ is a Novikov ring. Using this we define a notion of '$G_2$
quantum cohomology'. These ideas may be relevant to String Theory or M-Theory

projecting phase-resolved spectra onto the inside-out framework. In addition,
our flux modulation mapping technique extracts any information related to the
modulation of the line flux by utilising consecutive half-phase tomograms. We
apply this to both the standard and the inside-out techniques. Our test cases,
the polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen, and the intermediate polar PQ Gem, were chosen
because of their known accretion characteristics, namely ballistic, magnetic
and curtain dominated accretion, respectively. In all three cases the
inside-out tomogram better exposes low-velocity emission details which are
overly compacted in the standard tomogram. This is especially apparent for the
mid-inclination V834 Cen where the almost blob-like blended lower velocity
emission in the standard tomogram is more exposed in the inside-out tomogram,
making it easier to distinguish between the ballistic and magnetically confined
accretion flows that are evident in the trailed spectra. Similarly, the
inside-out tomogram enhances high velocity emission details which are washed
out in the standard tomogram. This is particularly effective in revealing the
high velocity magnetic accretion flows in the polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen. The
addition of our flux modulation technique gives a significant improvement in
reproducing the trailed input spectra adding more confidence to the
interpretation of the Doppler maps. Furthermore, amplitude and phase maps are

parallel to the c axis (EBD+c & EBD//c) were measured to be 3 and 12 MV/cm,
respectively. When the crystal structure is changed from sp3 of cubic-BN (c-BN)
to sp2 of h-BN, EBD+c for h-BN becomes smaller than that for c-BN, while EBD//c
for h-BN drastically increases. Therefore, h-BN can possess a relatively high
EBD concentrated only in the direction parallel to the c axis by conceding a
weak bonding direction in the highly anisotropic crystal structure. This
explains why the EBD//c for h-BN is higher than that for diamond. Moreover, the
presented EBD value obtained from the high quality bulk h-BN crystal can be
regarded as the standard for qualifying the crystallinity of h-BN layers grown
via chemical vapor deposition for future electronic applications.

post-processing the results of an N-body+hydro simulation of a small
cosmological volume, that uses the Multi-Phase Particle Integrator (MUPPI) for
star formation and stellar feedback, with the GRASIL-3D radiative transfer
code, that includes reprocessing of UV light by dust. Physical properties of
galaxies resemble observed ones, though with some tension at small and large
stellar masses. Comparing predicted SEDs of simulated galaxies with different
samples of local galaxies, we find that these resemble observed ones, when
normalised at 3.6 $\mu$m. A comparison with the Herschel Reference Survey shows
that, when binning galaxies in Star Formation Rate (SFR), average SEDs are
reproduced to within a factor of $\sim2$ even in normalization, while binning
in stellar mass highlights the same tension that is present in the stellar mass
-- SFR plane. We use our sample to investigate the correlation of IR luminosity
in Spitzer and Herschel bands with several galaxy properties. SFR is the
quantity that best correlates with IR light up to $160\ \mu$m, while at longer
wavelengths better correlations are found with molecular mass and, at $500\
\mu$m, with dust mass. However, using the position of the FIR peak as a proxy
for cold dust temperature, we assess that heating of cold dust is mostly
determined by SFR, with stellar mass giving only a minor contribution. We
finally show how our sample of simulated galaxies can be used as a guide to
understand the physical properties and selection biases of observed samples.

obtained from the former by expanding it around a specific background. Because
the matrix model can be a constructive formulation of string theory, this
relation suggests that NC field theory can also include quantum gravity. In
particular, the NC $U(1)$ gauge theory attracts much attention because its
low-energy effective action partially contains gravity where the metric is
determined by the $U(1)$ gauge field. Thus, the NC $U(1)$ gauge theory could be
a quantum theory of gravity. In this paper, we investigate the scenario by
calculating the scattering amplitude of massless test particles, and find that
the NC $U(1)$ gauge theory correctly reproduces the amplitude of the usual
graviton exchange if the noncommutativity that corresponds to the background of
the matrix model is appropriately averaged. Although this result partially
supports the relation between the NC $U(1)$ gauge theory and gravity, it is
desirable to find a mechanism by which such an average is naturally realized.

lead to a topological quantum number different from that which characterises
the ordered phase. The topological transition is also understood via a spectral

their entanglement content are studied, revealing a holographic relation with
the entanglement at criticality. The effects of a non-zero longitudinal field

within the renormalisation group (RG) formalism. The analysis reveals that the
critical point of the 1D TFIM and the 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain are
connected via a line of $SU(2)$-symmetric theories. We extend our analysis to

solar atmosphere for inferring its properties. This powerful approach has
revealed two key long-standing problems in solar physics: the puzzling dilemmas
between theory and observations in several anomalously polarized spectral lines
and the need for inferring the ubiquitous weak chromospheric magnetic fields,
which requires discriminating the Hanle effect in dynamic optically thick
plasmas. However, the ever-present dynamics, i.e., the temporal evolution of
heatings and macroscopic motions, has been widely disregarded when modeling and
interpreting the scattering polarization. This has hindered a consistent
theoretical solution to the puzzle while falsifying the Hanle diagnosis. Here,
we show that the dynamical evolution is a keystone for solving both problems
because its systematic impact allows an explanation of the observations from
'anomalous' instantaneous polarization signals. Evolution accounted for, we
reproduce amplitudes and (spectral and spatial) shapes of the Ca I 4227 A
polarization at solar disk center, identifying a restrictive arrangement of
magnetic fields, kinematics, heatings, and spatio-temporal resolution. We find
that the joint action of dynamics, Hanle effect, and low temporal resolutions
mimics Zeeman linear polarization profiles, the true weak-field Zeeman signals
being negligible. Our results allow reinterpretation of many polarization
signals of the solar spectra and support time-dependent scattering polarization
as a powerful tool for deciphering the spatio-temporal distribution of
chromospheric heatings and fields. This approach may be a key aid in developing

splittings of the ground state, in contrast to standard scattering theory,
which only allows for interferences from level splittings of the intermediate
state. Previous attempts to implement this idea had to rely on heuristic
arguments to allow modeling of the experimental data. In the present paper we
develop a formulation of the theory that can be self-consistently applied to
quantum systems with any combination of electronic and nuclear spins. No
statistical equilibrium or optical pumping is needed. The atom is assumed to be
unpolarized at the beginning of each scattering event. The theory is capable of
explaining both the phase matrix behavior of the laboratory data and the
existence of a symmetric polarization peak in the core of the solar D$_1$ line.
We also use it to predict the polarization structures that we expect to see in
a next-generation laboratory experiment with the rubidium isotopes $^{87}$Rb
and $^{85}$Rb.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/239",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the role of radial migration history of stars in chemical
evolution of a disk galaxy, in particular in understanding the origin of their
bimodal distribution on the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. For this purpose, we
examine the three different models with no, continuous, and discontinuous
radial migration, respectively. We find that for the model with radial
migration, the [alpha/Fe] ratios of stars in outer disk regions decrease more
rapidly with time than the model without radial migration, because the
associated net transfer of intermediate and old disk stars from inner to outer
disk regions increases the rate of Type Ia relative to that of Type II
supernovae in the latter regions. Moreover, in the model assuming rapid and
discontinuous radial migration, its effect on the stellar abundances at larger
radii is significant enough to provide the large difference in the evolution of
stars on the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane between inner and outer disk regions. As a
result we obtain the bimodal distribution of disk stars on the
[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane as observed in the Galactic stellar disk, thereby
implying that the event of discontinuous radial migration may play a key role
in reproducing the observed bimodality of stars on this abundance-ratio
diagram. We discuss possible mechanisms causing such discontinuous radial
migration in the early evolution of the Galactic disk, including the event of
minor merging of a relatively massive satellite onto the stellar disk.

observed water line fluxes from three blends and compute the 10~$\mu$m silicate

exploring disk dust and gas properties, and the effects of different stars. The
models also show that the increasing stellar luminosity enhance simultaneously
the strength of this dust feature and the water lines fluxes. No correlation is
found between the observed mid-IR water lines and the 10~$\mu$m silicate. Our
sample shows the same difference in the peak strength between amorphous and
crystalline silicates that was noted in earlier studies, but our models do not
support this intrinsic difference in silicate peak strength. Individual
properties of our model series are not able to reproduce the most extreme
observations, suggesting that more complex dust properties are required. A
parametrized settling prescription is able to boost the peak strength by a
factor 2 for the standard model. Water line fluxes are unrelated to the
composition of the dust. The pronounced regular trends seen in the model
results are washed out in the data due to the larger diversity in stellar and
disk properties compared to our model series. The disks with with weaker mid-IR
water line fluxes are depleted in gas or enhanced in dust in the inner 10~au.
In the case of gas depleted disks, settling produces very strong 10~$\mu$m
silicate features, with strong peak strength.

entire economies. Catastrophe (CAT) bonds have emerged as a method to offset
this risk and a corresponding literature has developed that attempts to provide
a market-consistent pricing methodology for these and other long-dated,
insurance-type contracts. This paper aims to unify and generalize several of
the widely-used pricing approaches for long-dated contracts with a focus on
stylized CAT bonds and market-consistent valuation. It proposes a loading
pricing concept that combines the theoretically possible minimal price of a
contract with its formally obtained risk neutral price, without creating
economically meaningful arbitrage. A loading degree controls how much influence
the formally obtained risk neutral price has on the market price. A key finding
is that this loading degree has to be constant for a minimally fluctuating
contract, and is an important, measurable characteristic for prices of
long-dated contracts. Loading pricing allows long-dated, insurance-type
contracts to be priced less expensively and with higher return on investment
than under classical pricing approaches. Loading pricing enables insurance
companies to accumulate systematically reserves needed to manage its risk of
ruin in a market consistent manner.

that two bodies separated by a gap cannot exchange heat via phonons. Recently,
a mechanism was proposed by which phonons can transport heat across a vacuum
gap - through Van der Waals interaction between two bodies with gap less than
wavelength of light. Such heat transfer mechanisms are highly relevant for
heating (and cooling) of nanostructures; the heating of the flying heads in
magnetic storage disks is a case in point. Here, the theoretical derivation for
modeling phonon transmission is revisited and extended to the case of two
bodies made of different materials separated by a vacuum gap. Magnitudes of

design which includes an active and a placebo control in addition to an
experimental treatment. We compare several sample size re-estimation procedures

size re-estimation based on unbiased variance estimators such as the Xing-Ganju
variance estimator results in underpowered trials, as it is expected since an
overestimation of the variance and thus the sample size is in general required
for the re-estimation procedure to eventually meet the target power. Moreover,
we propose an inflation factor for the sample size re-estimation with the
Xing-Ganju variance estimator and show that this approach results in adequately
powered trials. Due to favorable features of Xing-Ganju variance estimator such
as unbiasedness and a distribution independent of the group means, the
inflation factor does not depend on the nuisance parameter and, therefore, can
be calculated prior to a trial.

nonlinear diffusion equations of porous medium-type of the form $\partial_t u +
{\mathcal L}u^m=0$, $m>1$, where the operator ${\mathcal L}$ belongs to a
general class of linear operators, and the equation is posed in a bounded
domain $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^N$. As possible operators we include the three
most common definitions of the fractional Laplacian in a bounded domain with
zero Dirichlet conditions, and also a number of other nonlocal versions. In
particular, ${\mathcal L}$ can be a power of a uniformly elliptic operator with
$C^1$ coefficients. Since the nonlinearity is given by $u^m$ with $m>1$, the
equation is degenerate parabolic.
  The basic well-posedness theory for this class of equations has been recently
developed in [14,15]. Here we address the regularity theory: decay and
positivity, boundary behavior, Harnack inequalities, interior and boundary
regularity, and asymptotic behavior. All this is done in a quantitative way,
based on sharp a priori estimates. Although our focus is on the fractional
models, our results cover also the local case when ${\mathcal L}$ is a
uniformly elliptic operator, and provide new estimates even in this setting.
  A surprising aspect discovered in this paper is the possible presence of
non-matching powers for the long-time boundary behavior. More precisely, when
${\mathcal L}=(-\Delta)^s$ is a spectral power of the {Dirichlet} Laplacian
inside a smooth domain, we can prove that:
  - when $2s> 1-1/m$, for large times all solutions behave as ${\rm
dist}^{1/m}$ near the boundary;
  - when $2s\le 1-1/m$, different solutions may exhibit different boundary
behavior.
  This unexpected phenomenon is a completely new feature of the nonlocal
nonlinear structure of this model, and it is not present in the semilinear
elliptic equation ${\mathcal L}u^m=u$.

engineering holistically to clarify the reasoning behind the different
approaches and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We shall then show
how developments from seemingly disjointed views could be integrated to achieve
the same goal of creating cognitive machines. By reviewing the major
contributions in the different fields and showing the potential for a combined
approach, this work intends to assist the research community in devising more
unified methods and techniques for developing cognitive machines.

where $p, q > 1$ and $\mu > 0$. We show the existence of initial data such that
the corresponding solution to this system blows up in finite time $T(u_0, v_0)$
simultaneously in $u$ and $v$ only at one blowup point $a$, according to the
following asymptotic dynamics: $$\left\{\begin{array}{c} u(x,t)\sim
\Gamma\left[(T-t) \left(1 + \dfrac{b|x-a|^2}{(T-t)|\log

(\Gamma(p,q), \gamma(p,q))$. The construction relies on the reduction of the
problem to a finite dimensional one and a topological argument based on the
index theory to conclude. Two major difficulties arise in the proof: the
linearized operator around the profile is not self-adjoint even in the case
$\mu = 1$; and the fact that the case $\mu \ne 1$ breaks any symmetry in the
problem. In the last section, through a geometrical interpretation of
quantities of blowup parameters whose dimension is equal to the dimension of
the finite dimensional problem, we are able to show the stability of these
blowup behaviors with respect to perturbations in initial data.

dynamical system approach to study the evolution of the Universe. The model
reaches a very good agreement with the newest experimental data and yields an
inflationary epoch caused by a singularity of the type III. The present-day
accelerated expansion is also provided by the model. We also show that the Lie
and Noether symmetry approaches are very useful tools in cosmological
considerations. We examine two other models of Extended Theories of Gravity
(ETGs): the novel hybrid metric-Palatini gravity and a minimally coupled to
gravity scalar field. The first one is applied to homogeneous and isotropic
model while in the scalar-tensor theory we study anisotropic universes. We use
the symmetries in order to find unknown forms of potential and to solve
classical field equations in both models. The symmetries also are very helpful
in searching exact and invariant solutions of Wheeler-DeWitt equations. In the
last part we are interested in equilibrium configurations and stability
conditions of relativistic stars in the framework of scalar-tensor theories.
Firstly, we show that TOV-like form of the equilibrium equations can be
obtained for a wide class of ETGs if generalized energy density and pressure
are defined. According to our studies, a neutron star is a stable system for
the minimally coupled scalar field model. There is a supplement including notes
on symmetries as well as dynamical systems approach. The illustrative examples
of applications are also provided.

in many natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and
machine translation. However, when the vocabulary is large, the RNN model will
become very big (e.g., possibly beyond the memory capacity of a GPU device) and
its training will become very inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel
technique to tackle this challenge. The key idea is to use 2-Component (2C)
shared embedding for word representations. We allocate every word in the
vocabulary into a table, each row of which is associated with a vector, and
each column associated with another vector. Depending on its position in the
table, a word is jointly represented by two components: a row vector and a
column vector. Since the words in the same row share the row vector and the
words in the same column share the column vector, we only need $2 \sqrt{|V|}$
vectors to represent a vocabulary of $|V|$ unique words, which are far less
than the $|V|$ vectors required by existing approaches. Based on the
2-Component shared embedding, we design a new RNN algorithm and evaluate it
using the language modeling task on several benchmark datasets. The results
show that our algorithm significantly reduces the model size and speeds up the
training process, without sacrifice of accuracy (it achieves similar, if not
better, perplexity as compared to state-of-the-art language models).
Remarkably, on the One-Billion-Word benchmark Dataset, our algorithm achieves
comparable perplexity to previous language models, whilst reducing the model
size by a factor of 40-100, and speeding up the training process by a factor of
2. We name our proposed algorithm \emph{LightRNN} to reflect its very small
model size and very high training speed.

models for every parameter is a long-standing problem. This paper investigates
the use of deep reinforcement learning for runtime parameters of cloud
databases under latency constraints. Cloud services serve up to thousands of
concurrent requests per second and can adjust critical parameters by leveraging
performance metrics. In this work, we use continuous deep reinforcement
learning to learn optimal cache expirations for HTTP caching in content
delivery networks. To this end, we introduce a technique for asynchronous
experience management called delayed experience injection, which facilitates
delayed reward and next-state computation in concurrent environments where
measurements are not immediately available. Evaluation results show that our
approach based on normalized advantage functions and asynchronous CPU-only
training outperforms a statistical estimator.

solving the one generated by the cost function of optimal trading. We provide a

time-dependent \textit{inequality}, suitable for an experimental test of the
hypothesis of realism. The derivation of these relations is based on the
concept of conditional probability and on Bayes' theorem in the framework of
Kolmogorov's axiomatics of probability theory. The equality obtained is
intrinsically different from the well known GHZ-equality and its variants,
because violation of the new equality might be tested in experiments with only
two microsystems in a maximally entangled Bell state $\big\vert\,
\Psi^-\,\big\rangle$, while a test of the GHZ-equality requires at least three
quantum systems in a special state $\big\vert\,
\Psi^{\textrm{GHZ}}\,\big\rangle$. The obtained inequality differs from Bell's,
Wigner's, and Leggett-Garg inequalities, because it deals with spin $s=1/2$
projections onto only two non-parallel directions at two different moments of
time, while a test of the Bell and Wigner inequalities requires at least three
non-parallel directions, and a test of the Leggett-Garg inequalities -- at
least three distinct moments of time. Hence, the proposed inequality seems to
allow one to avoid the ""contextuality loophole"". Violation of the proposed
equality and inequality is illustrated with the behaviour of a pair of
anti-correlated spins in an external magnetic field and also with the
oscillations of flavour-entangled pairs of neutral pseudoscalar mesons.

emerge as natural extensions to modal derivatives for displacement fields other
than the vibration modes, such as the Krylov subspace vectors. Here the dynamic
problem is projected onto the tangent space of the quadratic manifold, allowing
for a much less number of generalized coordinates compared to linear basis

last century, with highly precise quantization values for the Hall conductance
in multiples of $e^2/h$, has been the first fascinating manifestation of the
topological state of matter driven by magnetic field and disorder, and related
to the formation of non-dissipative current flow. In 2005, several new
phenomena such as the spin Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect were
predicted in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and vanishing external
magnetic field. More recently, the Zeeman spin Hall effect and the formation of
valley Hall topological currents have been introduced for graphene-based
systems, under time-reversal or inversion symmetry-breaking conditions,
respectively. This review presents a comprehensive coverage of all these Hall
effects in disordered graphene from the perspective of numerical simulations of
quantum transport in two-dimensional bulk systems (by means of the Kubo
formalism) and multiterminal nanostructures (by means of the
Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker scattering and nonequilibrium Green function approaches).
In contrast to usual two-dimensional electron gases, the presence of defects in
graphene generates more complex electronic features such as electron-hole
asymmetry, defect resonances or percolation effect between localized impurity
states, which, together with extra degrees of freedom (sublattice pseudospin,
valley isospin), bring a higher degree of complexity and enlarge the transport
phase diagram.

this class the presence of a compact dusty disk has been postulated on the
basis of various spatially unresolved measurements. Our interferometric survey
was performed with the MIDI instrument on the VLTI. In total 19 different
systems were observed using variable baseline configurations. Combining all the
visibilities at a single wavelength at 10.7 micron, we fitted two parametric
models to the data: a uniform disk (UD) and a ring model mimicking a
temperature gradient. We compared our observables of the whole sample, with
synthetic data computed from a grid of radiative transfer models of passively
irradiated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. These models are computed with a
Monte Carlo code that has been widely applied to describe the structure of
protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects (YSO). The spatially resolved
observations show that the majority of our targets cluster closely together in
the distance-independent size-colour diagram, and have extremely compact N-band
emission regions. The typical uniform disk diameter of the N-band emission
region is about 40 mass which corresponds to a typical brightness temperature
of 400-600~K. The resolved objects display very similar characteristics in the
interferometric observables and in the spectral energy distributions.
Therefore, the physical properties of the disks around our targets must be
similar. The grid of protoplanetary disk models covers very well the observed
objects. Much like for young stars, the spatially resolved N-band emission
region is determined by the hot inner rim of the disk. Continued comparisons
between post-AGB and protoplanetary disks will help to understand grain growth
and disk evolution processes,

bulge and disc novae in M31 are scaled to the Milky Way, which we approximate
as a disc with a 20 kpc radius and elliptical bulge with semi major axis 3 kpc

double exponential disc with vertical and radial scale heights of r_d = 5 kpc

easily reproduce the observed fraction of gamma-ray novae, implying that these
apparently rare sources are in fact nearby and not intrinsically rare. We
conclude that classical novae with m_R < 12 and within ~8 kpc are likely to be

device on a SiO2 substrate exhibited a maximum current density of 3.3 x 10E10

MoS2. Our breakdown thermometry analysis revealed that self-heating was impeded
along BP-dielectric interface, resulting in a thermal plateau inside the
channel and eventual Joule breakdown. Using a size-dependent electro-thermal
transport model, we extracted an interfacial thermal conductance of 1-10 MW/m2
K for the BP-dielectric interfaces. By using hBN as a dielectric material for
BP instead of thermally resistive SiO2 (about 1.4 W/m K), we observed a 3 fold
increase in breakdown power density and a relatively higher electric field
endurance together with efficient and homogenous thermal spreading because hBN
had superior structural and thermal compatibility with BP. We further confirmed
our results based on micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, and
observed that BP devices on hBN exhibited centrally localized hotspots with a
breakdown temperature of 600K, while the BP device on SiO2 exhibited a hotspot
in the vicinity of the electrode at 520K.

aggregating of these NL text segments to generate a more fluent and
comprehensive form of the content.Restricting our attention to description of
individuals and concepts, we find that the approach currently followed in the
available tools is that of determining the set of all logical conditions that
are satisfied by the given individual/concept name and translate these
conditions verbatim into corresponding NL descriptions.Human-understandability
of such descriptions is affected by the presence of repetitions and
redundancies, as they have high fidelity to their OWL representation.In the
literature, no efforts had been taken to remove redundancies and repetitions at
the logical-level before generating the NL descriptions of entities and we find
this to be the main reason for lack of readability of the generated
text.Herein, we propose a technique called semantic-refinement(SR) to generate
meaningful and easily-understandable descriptions of individuals and concepts
of a given OWLontology.We identify the combinations of OWL/DL constructs that
lead to repetitive/redundant descriptions and propose a series of refinement
rules to rewrite the conditions that are satisfied by an individual/concept in
a meaning-preserving manner.The reduced set of conditions are then employed for
generating NL descriptions.Our experiments show that, SR leads to significantly
improved descriptions of ontology entities.We also test the effectiveness and
usefulness of the the generated descriptions for the purpose of validating the
ontologies and find that the proposed technique is indeed helpful in the
context.

precisely, for the situation when $(A_{n},B_{n})_{n\ge 1}$ is modulated by an
ergodic Markov chain $(M_{n})_{n\ge 0}$ with countable state space
$\mathcal{S}$ and stationary distribution $\pi$. We provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for the a.s. and the distributional convergence of the
backward iterations $\Psi_{1}\circ\ldots\circ\Psi_{n}(Z_{0})$ and also describe
all possible limit laws as solutions to a certain Markovian stochastic
fixed-point equation. As a consequence of the random environment, these limit
laws are stochastic kernels from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ rather than
distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, thus reflecting their dependence on where the
driving chain is started. We give also necessary and sufficient conditions for
the distributional convergence of the forward iterations
$\Psi_{n}\circ\ldots\circ\Psi_{1}$. The main differences caused by the
Markovian environment as opposed to the extensively studied case of independent
and identically distributed (iid) $\Psi_{1},\Psi_{2},\ldots$ are that: (1)
backward iterations may still converge in distribution, if a.s. convergence
fails, (2) the degenerate case when $A_{1}c_{M_{1}}+B_{1}=c_{M_{0}}$ a.s. for
suitable constants $c_{i}$, $i\in\mathcal{S}$, is by far more complex than the
degenerate case for iid $(A_{n},B_{n})$ when $A_{1}c+B_{1}=c$ a.s. for some

different laws given $M_{0}=i$ for $i\in\mathcal{S}$ so that the former ones
need a separate analysis. Our proofs draw on related results for the iid-case,

expected emission wave packets (with small amplitude), for some selected
initial conditions the production of kink-antikink pairs results in a large
energy reset. Also, the topological number of a kink in the central region
changes in the contrast of saving full topological number. At lower excitation
energies there is a long-living excited vibrational state of the kink; this
phenomenon is the final stage of all considered initial states. Over time this
excited state of the kink changes to a well-known linearized solution - a
discrete kink excitation mode. This method yields a qualitatively new way to
describe the large-amplitude bion, which was detected earlier in the
kink-scattering processes in the nontopological sector.

with the choice of specific kernels supported on a tubular neighborhood around

choice of kernels, specifically its number of vanishing moments, which enables
accurate computations of integrals over a class of closed, continuous,
piecewise smooth, curves or surfaces; e.g. curves in two dimensions that
contain finite number of corners. We prove that for smooth interfaces, if the
kernel has enough vanishing moments (related to the dimension of the embedding

not exact but we provide an analytical result relating the severity of the

first order for light/heavy quark masses and second order for intermediate

core of numerous data mining and machine learning applications, including data
diversification, data summarization, and coverage problems. In this work, we
study this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one
at a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms
that maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window
model, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last
$W$ items.
  In this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a
provable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the
window. In particular we give a $\frac{1}{3} - \epsilon$ approximation
algorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the
elements, $\Phi$, and linear in the solution size $k$ for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$ . At the same time, processing each element only requires a
polylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better
approximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of
using more memory, provides a $\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon$ approximation and allows
a tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm
matches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in
insertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms on a number of real world
datasets, showing that their practical performance far exceeds the theoretical
bounds. The algorithms preserve high quality solutions in streams with millions
of items, while storing a negligible fraction of them.

not scale with cell size, and we recently found evidence for non-centrosomal
microtubule nucleation. Here, we combine autocatalytic nucleation and
polymerization dynamics to develop a biophysical model of aster growth. Our
model predicts that asters expand as traveling waves and recapitulates all
major aspects of aster growth. As the nucleation rate increases, the model
predicts an explosive transition from stationary to growing asters with a
discontinuous jump of the growth velocity to a nonzero value. Experiments in
frog egg extract confirm the main theoretical predictions. Our results suggest
that asters observed in large frog and amphibian eggs are a meshwork of short,
unstable microtubules maintained by autocatalytic nucleation and provide a
paradigm for the assembly of robust and evolvable polymer networks.

the relation module of the presentation. However, when there is a single

population have been increased. This situation makes it important for host
countries to do right predictions for the future population of their native
people as well as immigrant people. The knowledge of the attained number of
accumulated population is necessary for future planning, concerning to
education,health, job, housing, safety requirements, etc. In this work, for
updating historically well known formulas of population dynamics of a community
are revisited in the framework of compound growth and fractional calculus to
get more realistic relations. Within this context, for a time t, the population
evolution of a society which owns two different components is calculated.
Concomitant relations have been developed to provide a comparison between the
native population and the immigrant population that come into existence where
at each time interval a colonial population is joined. Eventually at time t,
the case where the native population becomes equal to immigrant population is
discussed. Moreover, the differential equation of a probability function for
the equilibrium state of accumulative population is obtained. It is seen that
the equilibrium solution can be written as a series in terms of Bernoulli
numbers. In the calculation of population dynamics, Mittag- Leffler(M-L)
function replaces the exponential function.

  Arctic sea ice model",,,,,"physics.ao-ph math.PR nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stochastic Arctic sea ice model described as a single periodic
non-autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation (ODE) is useful in
explaining the seasonal variability of Arctic sea ice. However, to be nearer to
realistic approximations we consider the inclusion of long-term forcing
implying the effect of slowly-varying ocean or atmospheric low-frequencies. In
this research, we rely on the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation instead of the
stochastic ODE owing to the advantages of the Fokker-Planck equation in dealing
with higher moments calculations. We include simple long-term forcing into the
Fokker-Planck equation and then seek approximate stochastic solutions. The
formalism based on the Fokker-Planck equation with a singular perturbation
method is flexible with regard to accommodating further complexity that arises
due to the inclusion of long-term forcing. These solutions are then applied to
the stochastic Arctic sea ice model with long-term forcing. Strong seasonality
in the Arctic sea ice model combined with long-term forcing, changes the
seasonal variability depending on the phase of the long-term forcing. The
change includes the shift of mean and the increase or decrease of variance and
skewness. Stochastic realisations show that the change of the statistical
moments due to long-term forcing is realised by unusual fluctuations
particularly concentrated at a specific time of a year.

changes to off-load parts of the computation to the GPUs. Then, we identify
further possible improvements to achieve even higher performance and

several perspectives on complexity and what constitutes complex behaviour or
complex systems, as opposed to regular, predictable behaviour and simple
systems. In this paper, we explore the following perspectives on complexity:
""effort-to-describe"" (Shannon entropy $H$, Lempel-Ziv complexity $LZ$),
""effort-to-compress"" ($ETC$ complexity) and ""degree-of-order"" (Subsymmetry or
$SubSym$). While Shannon entropy and $LZ$ are very popular and widely used,
$ETC$ is a recently proposed measure for time series. In this paper, we also
propose a novel normalized measure $SubSym$ based on the existing idea of
counting the number of subsymmetries or palindromes within a sequence. We
compare the performance of these complexity measures on the following tasks: a)
characterizing complexity of short binary sequences of lengths 4 to 16, b)
distinguishing periodic and chaotic time series from 1D logistic map and 2D
H\'{e}non map, and c) distinguishing between tonic and irregular spiking
patterns generated from the ""Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire"" neuron
model. Our study reveals that each perspective has its own advantages and
uniqueness while also having an overlap with each other.

monitor patient health status especially for those with chronic disease, but
such records are usually incomplete due to unpunctuality and absence of
patients. In order to resolve the missing data problem over time, tensor-based
model is suggested for missing data imputation in recent papers because this
approach makes use of low rank tensor assumption for highly correlated data.
However, when the time intervals between records are long, the data correlation
is not high along temporal direction and such assumption is not valid. To
address this problem, we propose to decompose a matrix with missing data into
its latent factors. Then, the locally linear constraint is imposed on these
factors for matrix completion in this paper. By using a publicly available
dataset and two medical datasets collected from hospital, experimental results
show that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance by comparing
with the existing methods.

entanglement-driven symmetry breaking, the SO(9,1) symmetry of
$\mathcal{M}_{9+1}$ is broken to $SO(3,1)\times SO(6)$, where SO(3,1) [SO(6)]
is associated with gravity (gauge fields of matter fermions) in
(3+1)-dimensional spacetime ($\mathcal{M}_{3+1}$). The informational
completeness demands that matter fermions must appear in three families, each
having 16 independent matter fermions. Meanwhile, the fermion family space is
equipped with elementary SO(3) gauge fields in $\mathcal{M}_{9+1}$, giving rise
to the Higgs mechanism in $\mathcal{M}_{3+1}$ through the gauge-Higgs
unification. After quantum compactification of six extra dimensions, a
trinity---the quantized gravity, the three-family fermions of total number 48,

theory in $\mathcal{M}_{3+1}$. Possible routes of our theory to the Standard
