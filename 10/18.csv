profiles measured by the Auger electron spectroscopy technique in real physical
systems, i.e., the desorbed carbon/passive layer on NiTi substrate and the
adsorbed oxygen/surface of NiTi alloy. It is shown that abstruse layer profiles
may be converted to real layer structures using the modified Bohm theory, where
the quantum potential is due to an Auger electron effect. It is also pointed
out that the stationary probability density predicts multilayer structures of
abstruse depth profiles caused by carbon desorption and oxygen adsorption
processes. The criterion for a kind of break between the physical and
unphysical multilayer systems was found. We have concluded that the physics is
also characterized by the abstruse measurement and the modified Bohm formalism

studying multiple zeta values and some of their analogues and generalizations.
The second author, together with Kajikawa, Ohno, and Okuda, significantly
extended the definition of quasi-shuffle algebras so it could be applied to
multiple zeta q-values. This article extends some of the algebraic machinery of
the first author's original paper to the more general definition, and uses this
extension to obtain various algebraic formulas in the quasi-shuffle algebra in
a transparent way. Some applications to multiple zeta values, interpolated
multiple zeta values, multiple q-zeta values, and multiple polylogarithms are
given.

which arise in the study of splines. Splines play a key role in approximation
theory, geometric modeling, and numerical analysis, their properties depend on
combinatorics, topology, and geometry of a simplicial or polyhedral subdivision
of a region in R^k, and are often quite subtle. We describe four algebraic
techniques which are useful in the study of splines: homology, graded algebra,
localization, and inverse systems. Our goal is to give a hands-on introduction
to the methods, and illustrate them with concrete examples in the context of
splines. We highlight progress made with these methods, such as a formula for
the third coefficient of the polynomial giving the dimension of the spline
space in high degree, much of which builds on pioneering work of Schumaker,
Alfeld-Schumaker, and Billera. The objects appearing here may be computed using
the Macaulay2 software system.

succeeds at multiple high-level tasks, and enables the effective exploration
required to learn from sparse rewards. We test our proposed architecture on

the period of the week variables to provide more accurate forecasts. Secondly,
we develop a simple but effective quantile regression forecast. The novel
aspects of our methodology are two-fold. First, we introduce symmetry into the
time-decay parameter of the kernel density estimation based forecast. Secondly
we combine three probabilistic forecasts with different weights for different
periods of the month.

harbingers of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). If we use the Sun as a guide,
large stellar flares will dissipate two orders of magnitude less X-ray
radiative energy than the kinetic energy in the associated CME. Since coronal
emission on active stars appears to be dominated by flare activity, CMEs pose a
quandary for understanding the fraction of their energy budget stars can spend
on magnetic activity. One answer is magnetic suppression of CMEs, in which the
strong large-scale fields of active stars entrap and prevent CMEs unless their
free energy exceeds a critical value. The CME-less flaring active region NOAA
2192 presents a possible solar analogue of this. Monster CMEs will still exist,
and have the potential to ravage planetary atmospheres.

D}_n=(D_i)_{i=1}^n$ and average degree $1 \ll \omega_n \ll n$, generated by the
configuration model, and also the spectrum of the analogous random simple
graph. We show that, when the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of
$\omega_n^{-1} {\bf D}_n $ converges weakly to a limit $\nu$, under mild moment
assumptions (e.g., $D_i/\omega_n$ are i.i.d. with a finite second moment), the
ESD of the normalized adjacency matrix converges in probability to
$\nu\boxtimes \sigma_{\rm sc}$, the free multiplicative convolution of $\nu$
with the semicircle law. Relating this limit with a variant of the
Marchenko--Pastur law yields the continuity of its density (away from zero),
and an effective procedure for determining its support.
  Our proof of convergence is based on a coupling between the random simple
graph and multigraph with the same degrees, which might be of independent
interest. We further construct and rely on a coupling of the multigraph to an
inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph with the target ESD, using three
intermediate random graphs, with a negligible fraction of edges modified in
each step.

bioinformatics. For more than a decade we have developed state-of-art
predictors by carefully selecting and optimising inputs to a machine learning
method. The correlation has increased from 0.60 in ProQ to 0.81 in ProQ2 and
0.85 in ProQ3 mainly by adding a large set of carefully tuned descriptions of a
protein. Here, we show that a substantial improvement can be obtained using
exactly the same inputs as in ProQ2 or ProQ3 but replacing the support vector
machine by a deep neural network. This improves the Pearson correlation to 0.90
(0.85 using ProQ2 input features).

corresponding communication capacities. With forward assistance or no
assistance, we find that they are equal. We establish the mutual information of
the channel as an upper bound on the two-way assisted randomness distribution
capacity. This implies that all of the capacities are equal for
classical-quantum channels. On the other hand, we show that the back-assisted
randomness distribution capacity of a quantum-classical channels is equal to

in which the DE decay rate does not depend on external parameters such as the
scale factor or the curvature of the Universe. Instead, the DE decay rate is
assumed to be a constant depending only on intrinsic properties of DE and the
type of a decay channel, similar to case of the radioactive decay of unstable
particles and nuclei. As a consequence, the DE energy density becomes a
function of the proper time elapsed since its formation, presumably in the very
early Universe. Such a natural type of DE decay can profoundly affect the
expansion history of the Universe and its age. Metastable DE can decay in three
distinct ways: (i) exponentially, (ii) into dark matter, (iii) into dark
radiation. Testing metastable DE models with observational data we find that
the decay half-life must be many times larger than the age of the Universe.
Models in which dark energy decays into dark matter lead to lower values of the
Hubble parameter at large redshifts relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently
these models provide a better fit to cosmological BAO data (especially data
from from high redshift quasars) than concordance ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology.

computed herein is shown to depend not only on the temperature and density but
also on all other polynomial velocity-space moments of the distribution
function, such as the pressure tensor and heat flux vector. The exact
expression for the collisional momentum-transfer rate is determined, and is
used to formulate the nonlinear anisotropic resistivity. The new formalism
recovers the Spitzer resistivity, as well as the concept of thermal force if
the heat flux is assumed to be proportional to a temperature gradient.
Furthermore, if the pressure tensor is related to viscous stress, the latter
enters the expression for the resistivity. The relative importance of the
nonlinear term(s) with respect to the well-established electron inertia and
Hall terms is also examined. The subtle implications of the nonlinear
resistivity, and its dependence on the fluid variables, are discussed in the
context of magnetized plasma environments and phenomena such as magnetic
reconnection.

Anonymization is a common technique that is often used to protect the location

define the notion of perfect location privacy. We show how LBS's should use the
anonymization method to ensure that their users can achieve perfect location

her past locations. Using this i.i.d model, we show that if the pseudonym of
the user is changed before $O(n^{\frac{2}{r-1}})$ observations are made by the
adversary for that user, then the user has perfect location privacy. Here, n is
the number of the users in the network and r is the number of all possible
locations that users can go to. Next, we model users' movements using Markov
chains to better model real-world movement patterns. We show that perfect
location privacy is achievable for a user if the user's pseudonym is changed
before $O(n^{\frac{2}{|E|-r}})$ observations are collected by the adversary for
the user, where |E| is the number of edges in the user's Markov chain model.

union of subspaces. State-of-the-art approaches for solving this problem follow
a two-stage approach. In the first step, an affinity matrix is learned from the
data using sparse or low-rank minimization techniques. In the second step, the
segmentation is found by applying spectral clustering to this affinity. While
this approach has led to state-of-the-art results in many applications, it is
sub-optimal because it does not exploit the fact that the affinity and the
segmentation depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a joint
optimization framework --- Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering (S$^3$C) ---
for learning both the affinity and the segmentation. The proposed S$^3$C
framework is based on expressing each data point as a structured sparse linear
combination of all other data points, where the structure is induced by a norm
that depends on the unknown segmentation. Moreover, we extend the proposed
S$^3$C framework into Constrained Structured Sparse Subspace Clustering
(CS$^3$C) in which available partial side-information is incorporated into the
stage of learning the affinity. We show that both the structured sparse
representation and the segmentation can be found via a combination of an
alternating direction method of multipliers with spectral clustering.
Experiments on a synthetic data set, the Extended Yale B data set, the Hopkins
155 motion segmentation database, and three cancer data sets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

problems and simulating quantum many-body systems. This also implies,
unfortunately, that verification of the output of the quantum systems is not so
trivial, since predicting the output is exponentially hard. As another problem,
quantum system is very delicate for noise and thus needs error correction. Here
we propose a framework for verification of the output of fault-tolerant quantum
computation in the measurement-based model. Contrast to existing analyses on
fault-tolerance, we do not assume any noise model on the resource state, but an
arbitrary resource state is tested by using only single-qubit measurements to
verify whether the output of measurement-based quantum computation on it is
correct or not. The overhead for verification including classical processing is
linear in the size of quantum computation. Since full characterization of
quantum noise is exponentially hard for large-scale quantum computing systems,
our framework provides an efficient way of practical verification of
experimental quantum error correction. Moreover, the proposed verification
scheme is also compatible to measurement-only blind quantum computation, where
a client can accept the delegated quantum computation even when a quantum sever
makes deviation, as long as the output is correct.

Likewise, the processes ruling the acceleration of particles in shell-like SNRs
up to 1e15 eV, including the amplification of the magnetic field, are not clear
yet. Imaging polarimetry in this regard is crucial to localise the regions of
shock acceleration and to measure the strength and the orientation of the
magnetic field at these emission sites. X-ray polarimetry with the X-ray
Imaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE) will allow the understanding of the
magnetic field structure and intensity on different regions in SNRs and PWNe,
helping to unveil long-standing questions such as i.e. acceleration of cosmic
rays in SNRs or magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer. SNRs and PWNe also
represent the largest population of Galactic very-high energy gamma-ray
sources, therefore the study of their magnetic distribution with XIPE will
provide fundamental ingredients on the investigation of those sources at very
high energies. We will discuss the physics case related to SNRs and PWNe and
the expectations of the XIPE observations of some of the most prominent SNRs
and PWNe.

However, the time-independent dual Hamiltonian formalism for the

perturbation theories for investigating the dynamics of such systems. Here we
demonstrate that the Lie transform Hamiltonian perturbation theory can be
adapted to find the perturbative solutions and the frequency corrections for
the dissipative oscillatory systems. As a further application, we use the
perturbation theory to analytically calculate the Hannay angle for the van der
Pol oscillator's limit cycle trajectory when its parameters-the strength of the

limit to radiation resulting from electromagnetic particle acceleration in
one-zone ideal plasmas. In magnetic reconnection, however, particle
acceleration and radiation are decoupled because the electric field is larger
than the magnetic field in the diffusion region. We carry out two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations to determine the extent to which magnetic
reconnection can produce synchrotron radiation above the burnoff limit. We use
the test particle comparison (TPC) method to isolate the effects of cooling by
comparing the trajectories and acceleration efficiencies of test particles
incident on such a reconnection region with and without cooling them. We find
that the cooled and uncooled particle trajectories are typically similar during
acceleration in the reconnection region, and derive an effective limit on
particle acceleration that is inversely proportional to the average magnetic
field experienced by the particle during acceleration. Using the calculated
distribution of this average magnetic field as a function of uncooled final
particle energy, we find analytically that cooling does not affect power-law
particle energy spectra except at energies far above the synchrotron burnoff
limit. Finally, we compare fully cooled and uncooled simulations of
reconnection, confirming that the synchrotron burnoff limit does not produce a
cutoff in the particle energy spectrum. Our results indicate that the TPC
method accurately predicts the effects of cooling on particle acceleration in
relativistic reconnection, and that even far above the burnoff limit, the
synchrotron energy of radiation produced in reconnection is not limited by
cooling.

assemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each
network node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits
can be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by
means of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant
network nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a
virtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once.
  Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from
computer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage
entanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each
quantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a
physical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to
create long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features
unique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing
techniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes
for a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these
topologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to

significantly improved the translation quality of automatic machine

cases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely different
meaning. This is especially the case when rare words occur.
  When using statistical machine translation, it has already been shown that
significant gains can be achieved by simplifying the input in a preprocessing
step. A commonly used example is the pre-reordering approach.
  In this work, we used phrase-based machine translation to pre-translate the
input into the target language. Then a neural machine translation system
generates the final hypothesis using the pre-translation. Thereby, we use
either only the output of the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) system or
a combination of the PBMT output and the source sentence.

determine a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, indicative for antiferromagnetic

gapped magnon excitations. From the entropy release, we conclude about strong
correlations between magnetic order and lattice distortions. In addition, the
observed anomalies at the phase transitions also indicate strong coupling
between structural and electronic degrees of freedom. Utilizing dielectric

is that advection is accurately modeled. However, this complicates the
calculation of space derivatives. If a mesh is employed, it must be updated at
each time step. On the other hand, fixed mesh, Eulerian, formulations benefit
from the mesh being defined at the beginning of the simulation, but feature
non-linear advection terms. It therefore seems natural to combine the two
approaches, using a fixed mesh to perform calculations related to space
derivatives, and using the particles to advect the information with time. The
idea of combining Lagrangian particles and a fixed mesh goes back to
Particle-in-Cell methods, and is here considered within the context of the
finite element method (FEM) for the fixed mesh, and the particle FEM (pFEM) for
the particles.
  Our results, in agreement with recent works, show that interpolation
(""projection"") errors, especially from particles to mesh, are the culprits of
slow convergence of the method if standard, linear, FEs, are employed. By
including quadratically consistent shape functions for the particles, the rate
of convergence is restored to values competitive with purely Lagrangian
simulations.
  The procedure is validated on the Zalesak's disk problem, the Taylor-Green
vortex sheet flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

Johnstone shows that simplicial sets classify strict linear orders with
disjoint endpoints and that (classically) the unit interval is such an order.

and respectively, of the harmonic map heat flow between two closed Riemannian
manifolds. Our approach is based on the totally geodesic embedding of the
target manifold into $\mathbb{R}^N$ . Since embeddings of Riemannian manifolds
into Euclidean spaces can easily be made totally geodesic by extending the
Riemannian metric in a certain way into some tubular neighbourhood, the here
presented approach is quite general. Totally geodesic embeddings allow to
reformulate the harmonic map heat flow in a neighbourhood of the embedded
target manifold. This reformulation has the advantage that the problem becomes
unconstrained: Instead of assuming a priori that the solution to the flow maps
into the target manifold this fact becomes a property of the solution to the
extended flow for special initial data. The solution space to the reformulated
problem therefore exists of maps which are also allowed to map into the ambient
space of the target manifold. This simplifies the discretization of the
problem. Based on this observation, we here propose algorithms for the
computation of the harmonic map heat flow and of harmonic maps. In contrast to
previous schemes, our algorithm does not make use of projections onto the
target manifold, discrete tangential deformations, geodesic finite elements or
of Lagrange multipliers. We prove error estimates in the stationary case and
present some numerical tests at the end of the paper.

field theory for a wide variety of formal and phenomenological applications. In
this article we propose and check a definition of the so-called single cut
contributions needed to complete on-shell recursion relations for the integrand
of scattering amplitudes in generic power-counting renormalisable theories at
conjecturally any loop order. Our proposal meshes well with standard
dimensional regularisation and applies in particular directly to much of the
standard model of particle physics. Apart from a diagrammatic construction, at
one loop order we provide a direct cross-check for box coefficients.
Interestingly, at one loop our proposal can be related to a specific subset of
all double unitarity cuts as well as tree-level poles by iterated recursion. We
focus in particular on demonstrating the method in rational-term one-loop
examples in pure Yang-Mills theory. For the finite amplitudes we present
all-order arguments. First steps toward gravity integrands are taken.

prediction are major tasks. While a variety of animal monitoring strategies
exist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is
difficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we
propose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks
(WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is
to detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and
monitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application,
sensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering
animal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the
information from sensors. To achieve the information efficiently, we propose a
path planning approach for the UAV based on a Markov decision process (MDP)
model. The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals
are detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the
UAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before. Meanwhile,
the UAV explores other areas as well to cover the entire network and detects
changes in the animal positions. We first define the mathematical model
underlying the animal monitoring problem in terms of the value of information
(VoI) and rewards. We propose a network model including clusters of sensor
nodes and a single UAV that acts as a mobile sink and visits the clusters.
Then, one MDP-based path planning approach is designed to maximize the VoI
while reducing message delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
evaluated using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard.
Simulation results show that our approach outperforms greedy, random heuristics
and the path planning based on the traveling salesman problem.

model exhibit shift-variant resolution properties that depend greatly on the
acquisition protocol (e.g. short vs. full scans) and the anode angles of the
rays used to reconstruct a particular region. For physical CBCT experiments
focal spot blur was characterized and a spatial resolution phantom was scanned

shift-invariant blur, suggesting a potential means to overcome traditional CBCT

estimated via randomized benchmarking. We then derive a tighter bound that
applies under additional information about the coherence of the error, namely,
the unitarity, which can also be efficiently estimated via a related
experimental protocol. This improved bound smoothly interpolates between the
worst-case quadratic and best-case linear scalings for composite error

2.0 (sys.) km/s, a velocity dispersion of 0.1^+0.7_-0.1 km/s, and a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.42^+0.07_-0.08. The upper limit on the velocity
dispersion is sigma < 1.5 km/s at 95.5% confidence, and the corresponding upper
limit on the mass within the half-light radius of Tuc III is 9.0 x 10^4 Msun.
We cannot rule out mass-to-light ratios as large as 240 Msun/Lsun for Tuc III,
but much lower mass-to-light ratios that would leave the system
baryon-dominated are also allowed. We measure an upper limit on the metallicity
spread of the stars in Tuc III of 0.19 dex at 95.5% confidence. Tuc III has a
smaller metallicity dispersion and likely a smaller velocity dispersion than
any known dwarf galaxy, but a larger size and lower surface brightness than any
known globular cluster. Its metallicity is also much lower than those of the
clusters with similar luminosity. We therefore tentatively suggest that Tuc III
is the tidally-stripped remnant of a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy, but
additional precise velocity and metallicity measurements will be necessary for
a definitive classification. If Tuc III is indeed a dwarf galaxy, it is one of
the closest external galaxies to the Sun. Because of its proximity, the most
luminous stars in Tuc III are quite bright, including one star at V=15.7 that
is the brightest known member star of an ultra-faint satellite.

through the disc and begin to evolve viscously when tidal and shearing torques

flare lightcurves whose shape (width, skewness) is largely insensitive to the
model parameters, and a spectral correction to match the bandpass of the
available observations, that is calibrated using the observed spectra of the
flares. This simple model reproduces, with excellent agreement, the empirical

$^{60}$Fe in chondritic meteorites implies that the Sun formed in the vicinity
of one or more massive stars that exploded as supernovae (SNe). Massive stars
are more likely to form in massive star clusters ($>$1000 M$_{\odot}$) than
lower mass clusters. However, photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs from
massive stars and dynamical interactions with passing stars can inhibit planet
formation in clusters with radii of $\sim$1 pc. We investigate whether low-mass
(50 - 200 M$_{\odot}$) star clusters containing one or two massive stars are a
more likely avenue for early Solar system enrichment as they are more
dynamically quiescent.
  We analyse $N$-body simulations of the evolution of these low-mass clusters
and find that a similar fraction of stars experience supernova enrichment than
in high mass clusters, despite their lower densities. This is due to two-body
relaxation, which causes a significant expansion before the first supernova
even in clusters with relatively low (100 stars pc$^{-3}$) initial densities.
However, because of the high number of low mass clusters containing one or two
massive stars, the absolute number of enriched stars is the same, if not higher
than for more populous clusters. Our results show that direct enrichment of
protoplanetary discs from supernovae occurs as frequently in low mass clusters
containing one or two massive stars (>20 M$_{\odot}$) as in more populous star
clusters (1000 M$_\odot$). This relaxes the constraints on the direct
enrichment scenario and therefore the birth environment of the Solar System.

that clumps form with a characteristic baryonic mass in the range
$10^7-10^8~M_{\odot}$, with a small tail exceeding $10^9~M_{\odot}$ produced by
clump-clump mergers. This is in contrast with the observed kpc-size clumps with
masses up to $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ in high-redshift star-forming galaxies. In
this paper we show that the comparison between simulated and observed
star-forming clumps is hindered by limited observational spatial resolution and
sensitivity. We post-process high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of
clumpy discs using accurate radiative transfer to model the effect of ionizing
radiation from young stars and to compute H$\alpha$ emission maps. By comparing
the intrinsic clump size and mass distributions with those inferred from
convolving the H$\alpha$ maps with different gaussian apertures, we mimick the
typical resolution used in observations. We found that with 100 pc resolution,
mock observations can recover the intrinsic clump radii and stellar masses, in
agreement with those found by lensing observations. Instead, using a 1 kpc
resolution smears out individual clumps, resulting in their apparent merging.
This causes significant overestimations of the clump radii and, therefore,
masses derived using methods that use their observed sizes. We show that
limited sensitivity can also force observations to significantly overestimate
the clump masses. We conclude that a significant fraction of giant clumps
detected in the observations may result from artificially inflated radii and
masses, and that $\approx 100$ pc spatial resolution is required to capture
correctly the physical characteristics of star-forming clumps if they are
coherent structures produced by disc fragmentation.

obliquity affects the production of cosmic rays in high-resolution simulations

Lagrangian tracers to follow the properties of the thermal gas, the cosmic rays

scenarios by varying the obliquity-dependent acceleration efficiencies of
protons and electrons, and by examining the resulting hadronic $\gamma$-ray and
radio emission. We find that the radio emission does not change significantly
if only quasi-perpendicular shocks are able to accelerate cosmic-ray electrons.
Our analysis suggests that radio emitting electrons found in relics have been
typically shocked many times before $z=0$. On the other hand, the hadronic
$\gamma$-ray emission from clusters is found to decrease significantly if only
quasi-parallel shocks are allowed to accelerate cosmic-ray protons. This might
reduce the tension with the low upper limits on $\gamma$-ray emission from

9.42 * 10^-12 yr^-1, which corresponds to a mass doubling time of 105 billion

large molecular gas masses, comparable to or exceeding the galaxy stellar

UHECRs above 50~EeV when compared with the Auger spectrum. We consider the
possibility that both the TA excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in
the Northern sky. We carry out detailed simulations of UHECR propagation in
both the intergalactic medium and the Galaxy, using different values for the
intergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:
transients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent
with the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw
randomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine
the spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while
steady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all
the currently available observational data. While we reproduce fairly well the
Auger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets, most of the
simulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of TA (at most a few
percent depending on density model tested) show a much stronger anisotropy than
the one observed. We find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and
the anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within $\sim 10$ Mpc, to
account for the flux excess, and a strong extragalactic magnetic field $\sim
10$ nG, to reduce the excessive anisotropy.

that an axion winds over $N \gg 1$ fundamental periods. In string theory

backreacts on the compact space, ruining the structure of the relaxion action.
In particular, the barriers generated by strong gauge dynamics have height

Backreaction of monodromy charge can therefore spoil the relaxion mechanism. We

investigate the innermost region ($<100$ AU) around the HH 212-MM1 protostar
through ALMA band\,7 observations of methanol. The 8 GHz bandwidth spectrum
towards the peak of the continuum emission of the HH 212 system reveals at
least 19 transitions of methanol. Several of these lines (among which several
vibrationally excited lines in the v$_{\rm t}=1,2$ states) have upper energies
above 500 K. They originate from a compact ($<135$ AU in diameter), hot ($\sim
295$ K) region elongated along the direction of the SiO jet. We performed a fit
in the $uv$ plane of various velocity channels of the strongest high-excitation
lines. The blue- and red-shifted velocity centroids are shifted roughly
symmetrically on either side of the jet axis, indicating that the line-of-sight
velocity beyond 0.7 km s$^{-1}$ from systemic is dominated by rotational
motions. The velocity increases moving away from the protostar further
indicating that the emission of methanol is not associated with a Keplerian
disk or rotating-infalling cavity, and it is more likely associated with
outflowing gas. We speculate that CH$_3$OH traces a disk wind gas accelerated
at the base. The launching region would be at a radius of a few astronomical
units from the YSO.

recombination, can be used to constrain the explosion energy and progenitor
properties. Currently available for this purpose are purely analytic models,
which are accurate only to within an order of magnitude, and detailed numerical
simulations, which are more accurate but are applied to any event separately.
In this paper we derive an analytic model that is calibrated by numerical
simulations. This model is much more accurate than previous analytic models,
yet it is as simple to use. To derive the model we analyze simulated light
curves from numerical explosion of $124$ red supergiant progenitors, calculated
using the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that although the structure of
the progenitors we consider varies, the resulting light curves can be described
rather well based only on the explosion energy, ejecta mass and progenitor
radius. Our calibrated analytic model, which is based on these three
parameters, reproduces the bolometric luminosity within $25\%-35\%$ accuracy
and the observed temperature within $15\%$ accuracy (compared to previous
analytic models which are indeed found to be accurate only to within an order
of magnitude). We also consider deviations of the early time spectrum from
blackbody, and find that the Rayleigh-Jeans regime is slightly shallower
(roughly $L_\nu \propto \nu^{1.4}$). This modified spectrum affects the
optical/near-UV light curve mostly during the first day when the typical
observed temperature is $\gg 10^4 ~^\circ$K. We use our results to study the

together with statistical errors and a visual analysis of the quality of each

the structural composition of galaxies with stellar mass. At high masses
(log(Mstar/Msun)>11), the galaxy population is dominated by galaxies modelled
with a single Sersic or a bulge+disc with a bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity
ratio B/T>0.2. At intermediate masses (9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11), galaxies
described with bulge+disc but B/T < 0.2 are preponderant, whereas, at the low
mass end (log(Mstar/Msun)<9.5), the prevailing population is constituted by
galaxies modelled with either pure discs or nuclear point sources+discs (i.e.,
no discernible bulge). We obtain that 57% of the volume corrected sample of
disc galaxies in the CALIFA sample host a bar. This bar fraction shows a
significant drop with increasing galaxy mass in the range

resolution of optical telescopes, turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium
fundamentally limits the resolution of radio telescopes. We present a
scattering mitigation framework for radio imaging with very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) that partially overcomes this limitation. Our framework,
""stochastic optics,"" derives from a simplification of strong interstellar
scattering to separate small-scale (""diffractive"") effects from large-scale
(""refractive"") effects, thereby separating deterministic and random
contributions to the scattering. Stochastic optics extends traditional
synthesis imaging by simultaneously reconstructing an unscattered image and its
refractive perturbations. Its advantages over direct imaging come from
utilizing the many deterministic properties of the scattering -- such as the
time-averaged ""blurring,"" polarization independence, and the deterministic
evolution in frequency and time -- while still accounting for the stochastic
image distortions on large scales. These distortions are identified in the
image reconstructions through regularization by their time-averaged power
spectrum. Using synthetic data, we show that this framework effectively removes
the blurring from diffractive scattering while reducing the spurious image
features from refractive scattering. Stochastic optics can provide significant
improvements over existing scattering mitigation strategies and is especially
promising for imaging the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius
A*, with the Global mm-VLBI Array and with the Event Horizon Telescope.

using the Lorenz equations, a system with three state variables $(x,y,z)$ and
three parameters $(\beta,\sigma,r)$. Bounds are reported for infinite-time
averages of all eighteen moments $x^ly^mz^n$ up to quartic degree that are
symmetric under $(x,y)\mapsto(-x,-y)$. These bounds apply to all solutions
regardless of stability, including chaotic trajectories, periodic orbits, and
equilibrium points. The analytical approach yields two novel bounds that are
sharp: the mean of $z^3$ can be no larger than its value of $(r-1)^3$ at the
nonzero equilibria, and the mean of $xy^3$ must be nonnegative. The interval
arithmetic approach is applied at the standard chaotic parameters to bound
eleven average moments that all appear to be maximized on the shortest periodic
orbit. Our best upper bound on each such average exceeds its value on the
maximizing orbit by less than 1%. Many bounds reported here are much tighter
than would be possible without computer assistance.

Networks are often modeled by the stochastic Chemical Master Equation, but
methods for systematic identification of key properties of the global dynamics
are currently lacking. We present a method for analyzing global dynamics of
gene networks using the Markov State Model (MSM) framework, which utilizes a
separation-of-timescales based clustering method to obtain a coarse-grained
state transition graph that approximates global gene network dynamics. The
method identifies the number, phenotypes, and lifetimes of long-lived network
states. Application of transition path theory to the constructed MSM decomposes
global dynamics into a set of dominant transition paths and associated relative
probabilities for stochastic state-switching. In this proof-of-concept study,
we found that the MSM provides a general framework for analyzing and
visualizing stochastic multistability and state-transitions in gene networks.
Our results suggest that the MSM framework, adopted from the field of atomistic
Molecular Dynamics, can be a useful tool for quantitative Systems Biology at

learning reveal an intriguing --and yet poorly understood-- dichotomy. Either
simple local algorithms succeed in estimating the object of interest, or even
sophisticated semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations fail.
  In order to explore this phenomenon, we study a classical SDP relaxation of
the minimum graph bisection problem, when applied to Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random
graphs with bounded average degree $d>1$, and obtain several types of results.
First, we use a dual witness construction (using the so-called non-backtracking
matrix of the graph) to upper bound the SDP value. Second, we prove that a
simple local algorithm approximately solves the SDP to within a factor
$2d^2/(2d^2+d-1)$ of the upper bound. In particular, the local algorithm is at
most $8/9$ suboptimal, and $1+O(1/d)$ suboptimal for large degree.
  We then analyze a more sophisticated local algorithm, which aggregates
information according to the harmonic measure on the limiting Galton-Watson
(GW) tree. The resulting lower bound is expressed in terms of the conductance
of the GW tree and matches surprisingly well the empirically determined SDP
values on large-scale Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graphs.
  We finally consider the planted partition model. In this case, purely local
algorithms are known to fail, but they do succeed if a small amount of side
information is available. Our results imply quantitative bounds on the
threshold for partial recovery using SDP in this model.

creates a cocoon composed of an outer Newtonian shocked stellar material and an
inner (possibly relativistic) shocked jet material. The jet deposits
$10^{51}-10^{52}$ erg into this cocoon. This energy is comparable to the GRB's
energy and to the energy of the accompanying supernova, yet its signature has
been largely neglected so far. A fraction of the cocoon energy is released
during its expansion following the breakout from the star and later as it
interacts with the surrounding matter. We explore here the possible signatures
of the cocoon emission and outline a framework to calculate them from the
conditions of the cocoon at the time of the jet breakout. We show that the
cocoon signature depends strongly on the level of mixing between the shocked
jet and shocked stellar material that fills it, which is currently unknown. We
find that if there is no mixing at all then the $\gamma$-ray emission from the
cocoon is so bright that it should have been already detected, and the lack of
such detections indicates that mixing at some level must take place. We
calculate also the expected signal for partial and full mixing. While the
typical signals are weaker than GRBs' afterglows, the latter are highly beamed
while the former have wide angles. We predict that future optical, UV and X-ray
transient searches, like LSST, ZTF, ULTRASAT, ISS-Lobster and others will most
likely detect such signals, providing a wealth of information on the
progenitors and jets of GRBs. While we focus on long GRBs, we note that
analogous (but weaker) cocoons may arise in short GRBs as well. Their
signatures might be the most promising electromagnetic counterparts for
gravitational waves merger's signals.

packages, yet disastrous resonant vibrations are observed, necessitating
multi-million dollar repairs. Recent examples include pedestrian induced

the increased bouncing of the Squibb Park Bridge in Brooklyn in 2014. The most
prominent example of an unstable lively bridge is the London Millennium Bridge
which started wobbling as a result of pedestrian-bridge interactions.
Pedestrian phase-locking due to footstep phase adjustment, is suspected to be
the main cause of its large lateral vibrations; however, its role in the
initiation of wobbling was debated. In this paper, we develop foot force models
of pedestrians' response to bridge motion and detailed, yet analytically
tractable models of crowd phase-locking. We use bio-mechanically inspired
models of crowd lateral movement to investigate to what degree pedestrian
synchrony must be present for a bridge to wobble significantly and what is a
critical crowd size. Our results can be used as a safety guideline for
designing pedestrian bridges or limiting the maximum occupancy of an existing

numerically probing a specific bridge design. This is particularly important
because the US code for designing pedestrian bridges does not contain explicit
guidelines that account for the collective pedestrian behavior.

11,240 deg$^2$ of the SDSS single-epoch imaging survey (the main survey), 10
quasars with $20\le z_{\rm AB}\le20.5$ selected from 4223 deg$^2$ of the SDSS
overlap regions (regions with two or more imaging scans), and 13 quasars down

wide luminosity range of $-29.0\le M_{1450}\le-24.5$. This well-defined sample
is used to derive the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z\sim6$. After
combining our SDSS sample with two faint ($M_{1450}\ge-23$ mag) quasars from
the literature, we obtain the parameters for a double power-law fit to the QLF.
The bright-end slope $\beta$ of the QLF is well constrained to be
$\beta=-2.8\pm0.2$. Due to the small number of low-luminosity quasars, the
faint-end slope $\alpha$ and the characteristic magnitude $M_{1450}^{\ast}$ are
less well constrained, with $\alpha=-1.90_{-0.44}^{+0.58}$ and
$M^{\ast}=-25.2_{-3.8}^{+1.2}$ mag. The spatial density of luminous quasars,
parametrized as $\rho(M_{1450}<-26,z)=\rho(z=6)\,10^{k(z-6)}$, drops rapidly
from $z\sim5$ to 6, with $k=-0.72\pm0.11$. Based on our fitted QLF and assuming
an IGM clumping factor of $C=3$, we find that the observed quasar population
cannot provide enough photons to ionize the $z\sim6$ IGM at $\sim90$\%
confidence. Quasars may still provide a significant fraction of the required
photons, although much larger samples of faint quasars are needed for more
stringent constraints on the quasar contribution to reionization.

needs to have a metric that captures all the properties of the spacetime around
a neutron star. Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric,
i.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related
to the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the
inverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron
star from astrophysical observations. In this work we present such an
approximate stationary and axisymmetric metric for the exterior of neutron
stars, which is constructed using the Ernst formalism and is parameterised by
the relativistic multipole moments of the central object. This metric is given
in terms of an expansion on the Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates with the multipole
moments as free parameters and is shown to be extremely accurate in capturing
the physical properties of a neutron star spacetime as they are calculated
numerically in general relativity. Because the metric is given in terms of an
expansion, the expressions are much simpler and easier to implement, in
contrast to previous approaches. For the parameterisation of the metric in
general relativity, the recently discovered universal 3-hair relations are used
to produce a 3-parameter metric. Finally, a straightforward extension of this
metric is given for scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field, which
also admit a formulation in terms of an Ernst potential.

warm dust, which in Core Accretion models mainly emerges from the inner regions
of protostellar outflow cavities. Dust in dense core envelopes also imprints
characteristic extinction patterns at these wavelengths, causing intensity
peaks to shift along the outflow axis and profiles to become more symmetric at
longer wavelengths. We present observational results for the first eight
protostars in the survey, i.e., multiwavelength images, including some
ancillary ground-based MIR observations and archival {\it{Spitzer}} and
{\it{Herschel}} data. These images generally show extended MIR/FIR emission
along directions consistent with those of known outflows and with shorter
wavelength peak flux positions displaced from the protostar along the
blueshifted, near-facing sides, thus confirming qualitative predictions of Core
Accretion models. We then compile spectral energy distributions and use these
to derive protostellar properties by fitting theoretical radiative transfer
models. Zhang and Tan models, based on the Turbulent Core Model of McKee and
Tan, imply the sources have protostellar masses $m_*\sim10$--50$\:M_\odot$

disk accretion rates $\sim100\times$ smaller. We discuss reasons for these
differences and overall implications of these first survey results for massive

development of multiple layers of interactions, towards a fragile structure. In
this paper, we introduce a model of percolation where the condition that makes
a node functional is that the node is functioning in at least two of the layers
of the network. The model reduces to the commonly adopted percolation model for
multiplex networks when the number of layers equals two. For larger number of
layers, however, the model describes a scenario where the addition of new
layers boosts the robustness of the system by creating redundant
interdependencies among layers. We prove this fact thanks to the development of
a message-passing theory able to characterize the model in both synthetic and
real-world multiplex graphs.

  Several minor changes. Changed numbering to match the version that will be

Shimura varieties, in particular the Newton stratification of the special fiber
of a suitable integral model at a prime with parahoric level structure. This is
closely related to the structure of Rapoport-Zink spaces and of affine
Deligne-Lusztig varieties.
  We prove a Hodge-Newton decomposition for affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties
and for the special fibres of Rapoport-Zink spaces, relating these spaces to
analogous ones defined in terms of Levi subgroups, under a certain condition
(Hodge-Newton decomposability) which can be phrased in combinatorial terms.
  Second, we study the Shimura varieties in which every non-basic
$\sigma$-isogeny class is Hodge-Newton decomposable. We show that (assuming the
axioms of \cite{HR}) this condition is equivalent to nice conditions on either
the basic locus, or on all the non-basic Newton strata of the Shimura
varieties. We also give a complete classification of Shimura varieties
satisfying these conditions.
  While previous results along these lines often have restrictions to
hyperspecial (or at least maximal parahoric) level structure, and/or
quasi-split underlying group, we handle the cases of arbitrary parahoric level
structure, and of possibly non-quasi-split underlying groups. This results in a
large number of new cases of Shimura varieties where a simple description of
the basic locus can be expected. As a striking consequence of the results, we
obtain that this property is independent of the parahoric subgroup chosen as
level structure.
  We expect that our conditions are closely related to the question whether the
weakly admissible and admissible loci coincide.

polar orbits in spherical dark matter halos, presenting a challenge to the
observed Andromeda plane which is significantly tilted with respect to the

cross at a single point at Fermi level, around which the quasiparticles are a
novel type of 2D pseudospin-1 fermions. Going beyond the transition, the system

torque onto them allowing them to migrate in the disc. Small mass planets do
not affect the gas profile and migrate in the fast type~I migration. Although
type~I migration can be directed outwards for planets smaller than $20-30
M_\oplus$, planets above this mass should be lost into the central star long
before the disc disperses. Massive planets open a gap and subsequently migrate
in the slower, type~II migration, which could save them from migrating all the
way to the star. Hence, growing giant planets can be saved if and only if they
can reach the gap opening mass, because this extends their migration
time-scale, allowing them to eventually survive at large orbits until the disc
itself disperses.
  However, most of the previous studies only measured the torques on planets
with fixed masses and orbits to determine the migration rate. Additionally, the
transition between type~I and type~II migration itself is not well studied.
Here we use isothermal 2D disc simulations with FARGO-2D1D to study the
migration behaviour of gas accreting protoplanets in discs. We find that
migrating giant planets always open gaps in the disc. We further show
analytically and numerically that planets growing in the runaway gas accretion
regime will reach gap opening masses before migrating all the way to the
central star if the disc is not extremely viscous and/or thick. An accretion
rate limited to the radial gas flow in the disc, in contrast, is not fast
enough. When gas accretion by the planet is taken into account, the gap opening
process is accelerated because the planet accretes material originating from
its horseshoe region. This allows an accreting planet to transition to type~II
migration before being lost even if gas fails to be provided for a rapid enough
growth and the gap opening mass is not reached.

model sources at these high redshifts should exhibit luminosities of $\gtrsim

increasing almost proportionally to it. Thus, measurements of the FIR/sub-mm

Region Of Interest (ROI) is selected within which we search for the user's

inordinate measurement readings, called outliers, the sparse recovery methods

phenomenological coupling between strain and polarity: advancing cells pull on
their followers which then become polarized. With reasonable values of
parameters, this model agrees with several of our experimental observations.
Together, our experiments and model disantangle the respective contributions of
active velocity and of proliferation in monolayer migration, explain how cells
maintain their polarity far from the moving front, and highlight the importance
of strain-polarity coupling and density in long-range information propagation.

detection, and radio map interpolation using Wireless Local Area Networks
(WLANs). The localization method consists of a novel multicomponent
optimization technique that minimizes the squared $\ell_{2}$-norm of the
residuals between the radio map and the online Received Signal Strength (RSS)
measurements, the $\ell_{1}$-norm of the user's location vector, and weighted
$\ell_{2}$-norms of layered groups of Reference Points (RPs). RPs are grouped
using a new criterion based on the similarity between the so-called Access
Point (AP) coverage vectors. In addition, since AP readings are prone to
containing inordinate readings, called outliers, an augmented optimization
problem is proposed to detect the outliers and localize the user with cleaned
online measurements. Moreover, a novel scheme to record fingerprints from a
smaller number of RPs and estimate the radio map at RPs without recorded
fingerprints is developed using sparse recovery techniques. All localization
schemes are tested on RSS fingerprints collected from a real environment. The
overall scheme has comparable complexity with competing approaches, while it
performs with high accuracy under a small number of APs and finer granularity
of RPs.

  One benefit of this connection is a new and simple way to accelerate the
standard proximal algorithm by extrapolation towards the TD iteration, which
generically has a faster convergence rate. Another benefit is the potential
integration into the proximal algorithmic context of several new ideas that
have emerged in the DP/RL context. We discuss some of the possibilities, and in

  The linear fixed point methodology can be extended to nonlinear fixed point
problems involving a contraction, thus providing guaranteed and potentially
substantial acceleration of the proximal and forward backward splitting
algorithms at no extra cost. Moreover, the connection of proximal and TD

showcase the power of the proposed framework through an application in
recursive nonlinear system identification of high-order discrete-time

problem is transformed into a linear state estimation problem wherein the state

is also an eccentric binary with a period of 5.54 yr. The nature of both stars
is uncertain, although we know from X-ray studies that there is a wind-wind
collision whose properties change with orbital phase.
  Methods. Observations of Eta Car were carried out with the ESO VLTI and the
AMBER instrument between approximately five and seven months before the August
2014 periastron passage. Velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images were
reconstructed from the spectrally dispersed interferograms. Interferometric
studies can provide information on the binary orbit, the primary wind, and the
wind collision.
  Results. We present velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images reconstructed
in more than 100 different spectral channels distributed across the Br Gamma
2.166 micrometer emission line. The intensity distribution of the images
strongly depends on wavelength. At wavelengths corresponding to radial
velocities of approximately -140 to -376 km/s measured relative to line center,
the intensity distribution has a fan-shaped structure. At the velocity of -277
km/s, the position angle of the symmetry axis of the fan is ~ 126 degree. The
fan-shaped structure extends approximately 8.0 mas (~ 18.8 au) to the southeast
and 5.8 mas (~ 13.6 au) to the northwest, measured along the symmetry axis at
the 16% intensity contour. The shape of the intensity distributions suggests
that the obtained images are the first direct images of the innermost wind-wind
collision zone. Therefore, the observations provide velocity-dependent image
structures that can be used to test three-dimensional hydrodynamical, radiative
transfer models of the massive interacting winds of Eta Car.

systematic dependence upon Teff or vesini. We found, however, in spite of
almost solar Fe abundance ([Fe/H]~0), carbon turned out to be slightly subsolar

conclusion that [C/O] ratio was moderately subsolar (~-0.2) in the primordial
gas from which these Pleiades stars were formed ~120--130 Myr ago.
Interestingly, similarly young B-type stars are reported to show just the same
result ([C/O]~-0.2), while rather aged (~1-10 Gyr) field F-G stars of
near-solar metallicity yield almost the solar value ([C/O]~0) on the average.

the WTDiff gravity via the gauge fixing procedure. Secondly, we show that in
the WTDiff gravity the cosmological constant is a mere integration constant as

the unimodular gravity. A key point in this proof is to construct a covariantly

fundamental band dispersion which enables novel optoelectronic functionality
and devices. Exploration of photonic Dirac cone at the center of momentum space
has inspired an exceptional characteristic of zero-index, which is similar to
zero effective mass in fermionic Dirac systems. Such all-dielectric zero-index
photonic crystals provide an in-plane mechanism such that the energy of the
propagating waves can be well confined along the chip direction. A
straightforward example is to achieve the anomalous focusing effect without
longitudinal spherical aberration, when the size of zero-index lens is large
enough. Here, we designed and fabricated a prototype of zero-refractive-index
lens by comprising large-area silicon nanopillar array with plane-concave
profile. Near-zero refractive index was quantitatively measured near 1.55 um
through anomalous focusing effect, predictable by effective medium theory. The
zero-index lens was also demonstrated to perform ultralow longitudinal
spherical aberration. Such IC compatible device provides a new route to
integrate all-silicon zero-index materials into optical communication, sensing,
and modulation, and to study fundamental physics on the emergent fields of
topological photonics and valley photonics.

  Predictive Analytics of Diseases","Sijia Yang wrote the manuscript into to the current version",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique for feature
extraction and dimension reduction. The performance of classical LDA, however,
significantly degrades on the High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data for
the ill-posed inverse problem. Existing approaches for HDLSS data
classification typically assume the data in question are with Gaussian
distribution and deal the HDLSS classification problem with regularization.
However, these assumptions are too strict to hold in many emerging real-life
applications, such as enabling personalized predictive analysis using
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data collected from an extremely limited
number of patients who have been diagnosed with or without the target disease
for prediction. In this paper, we revised the problem of predictive analysis of
disease using personal EHR data and LDA classifier. To fill the gap, in this
paper, we first studied an analytical model that understands the accuracy of
LDA for classifying data with arbitrary distribution. The model gives a
theoretical upper bound of LDA error rate that is controlled by two factors:
(1) the statistical convergence rate of (inverse) covariance matrix estimators
and (2) the divergence of the training/testing datasets to fitted
distributions. To this end, we could lower the error rate by balancing the two
factors for better classification performance. Hereby, we further proposed a
novel LDA classifier De-Sparse that leverages De-sparsified Graphical Lasso to
improve the estimation of LDA, which outperforms state-of-the-art LDA
approaches developed for HDLSS data. Such advances and effectiveness are
further demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on
EHR datasets.

generalization ability (GA): the ability of a model to predict outcomes in new
samples from the same population. We believe that GA is one way formally to
address concerns about the external validity of a model. The GA of a model
estimated on a sample can be measured by its empirical out-of-sample errors,
called the generalization errors (GE). We derive upper bounds for the GE, which
depend on sample sizes, model complexity and the distribution of the loss
function. The upper bounds can be used to evaluate the GA of a model, ex ante.
We propose using generalization error minimization (GEM) as a framework for
model selection. Using GEM, we are able to unify a big class of penalized
regression estimators, including lasso, ridge and bridge, under the same set of
assumptions. We establish finite-sample and asymptotic properties (including
$\mathcal{L}_2$-consistency) of the GEM estimator for both the $n \geqslant p$
and the $n < p$ cases. We also derive the $\mathcal{L}_2$-distance between the
penalized and corresponding unpenalized regression estimates. In practice, GEM
can be implemented by validation or cross-validation. We show that the GE
bounds can be used for selecting the optimal number of folds in $K$-fold
cross-validation. We propose a variant of $R^2$, the $GR^2$, as a measure of
GA, which considers both both in-sample and out-of-sample goodness of fit.

evaluation indicates that SAT based CPF solving outperforms other makespan
optimal methods significantly in highly constrained situations (environments

excitation diagram shows a best-fit with a two-temperature LTE model with the
temperatures of ~200 and 660 K. We observed [C II] at 158um and high-J

ionic lines can come from a low-velocity C-shock. Comparison of H2 emission

  Acquisition Speed Limit",,,,,"cs.CY cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digital forensic evidence acquisition speed is traditionally limited by two
main factors: the read speed of the storage device being investigated, i.e.,
the read speed of the disk, memory, remote storage, mobile device, etc.), and
the write speed of the system used for storing the acquired data. Digital
forensic investigators can somewhat mitigate the latter issue through the use
of high-speed storage options, such as networked RAID storage, in the
controlled environment of the forensic laboratory. However, traditionally,
little can be done to improve the acquisition speed past its physical read
speed from the target device itself. The protracted time taken for data
acquisition wastes digital forensic experts' time, contributes to digital
forensic investigation backlogs worldwide, and delays pertinent information
from potentially influencing the direction of an investigation. In a remote
acquisition scenario, a third contributing factor can also become a detriment
to the overall acquisition time - typically the Internet upload speed of the
acquisition system. This paper explores an alternative to the traditional
evidence acquisition model through the leveraging of a forensic data
deduplication system. The advantages that a deduplicated approach can provide
over the current digital forensic evidence acquisition process are outlined and
some preliminary results of a prototype implementation are discussed.

build reliable prediction model or extract useful structure from an avalanche
of data. However, ML is also criticized by its difficulty in interpretation and
complicated parameter tuning. In contrast, visualization is able to well
organize and visually encode the entangled information in data and guild
audiences to simpler perceptual inferences and analytic thinking. But large
scale and high dimensional data will usually lead to the failure of many
visualization methods. In this paper, we close a loop between ML and
visualization via interaction between ML algorithm and users, so machine
intelligence and human intelligence can cooperate and improve each other in a
mutually rewarding way. In particular, we propose ""transparent boosting tree
(TBT)"", which visualizes both the model structure and prediction statistics of
each step in the learning process of gradient boosting tree to user, and
involves user's feedback operations to trees into the learning process. In TBT,
ML is in charge of updating weights in learning model and filtering information
shown to user from the big data, while visualization is in charge of providing
a visual understanding of ML model to facilitate user exploration. It combines
the advantages of both ML in big data statistics and human in decision making
based on domain knowledge. We develop a user friendly interface for this novel
learning method, and apply it to two datasets collected from real applications.
Our study shows that making ML transparent by using interactive visualization
can significantly improve the exploration of ML algorithms, give rise to novel
insights of ML models, and integrates both machine and human intelligence.

predicts the rating scores of users on items through making use of the
user-item interaction information. Besides the rating information between users
and items, lots of additional information have been employed to promote
recommendations, such as social relation and geographic location. Expenditure
information on each transaction between users and items is widely available on
e-commerce websites, often appearing next to the rating information, while
there is seldom study on the correlation between expenditures and rating
scores. In this paper, we first study their correlations in real data sets and
propose the expenditure aware rating prediction problem. From the data sets
crawled from a well-known social media platform Dianping in China, we find some
insightful correlations between expenditures and rating scores: 1) transactions
or experiences with higher expenditures usually lead to higher rating scores;
2) when the real expenditures are higher than users' normal spending behavior,
the users usually give higher scores; and 3) there are multiple grades of
expenditure behaviors. Based on these three observations, we propose an
Expenditure ware RatingPrediction method (EARP), based on low-rank matrix
factorization, to effectively incorporate the expenditure information.
Extensive experiments on five real data sets show that EARP not only always
outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines but also discovers the latent
characteristics of users and businesses.

acquiring new techniques. The training process could be optimized by
automatically providing some targeted recommendations or warnings, similar to
the expert surgeon's guidance. In this paper, we propose to reuse videos
recorded and stored during cataract surgeries to perform the analysis. The
proposed system allows to automatically recognize, in real time, what the
surgeon is doing: what surgical phase or, more precisely, what surgical step he
or she is performing. This recognition relies on the inference of a multilevel
statistical model which uses 1) the conditional relations between levels of
description (steps and phases) and 2) the temporal relations among steps and
among phases. The model accepts two types of inputs: 1) the presence of
surgical tools, manually provided by the surgeons, or 2) motion in videos,
automatically analyzed through the Content Based Video retrieval (CBVR)
paradigm. Different data-driven statistical models are evaluated in this paper.
For this project, a dataset of 30 cataract surgery videos was collected at
Brest University hospital. The system was evaluated in terms of area under the
ROC curve. Promising results were obtained using either the presence of
surgical tools ($A_z$ = 0.983) or motion analysis ($A_z$ = 0.759). The
generality of the method allows to adapt it to any kinds of surgeries. The
proposed solution could be used in a computer assisted surgery tool to support
surgeons during the surgery.

problem with one sensor and one estimator. The sensor makes sequential
observations about the state of an underlying memoryless stochastic process and
makes a decision as to whether or not to send this measurement to the
estimator. The sensor and the estimator have the common objective of minimizing
expected distortion in the estimation of the state of the process, over a
finite time horizon. The sensor is either charged a cost for each transmission
or constrained on transmission times. As opposed to the prior work where
communication between the sensor and the estimator was assumed to be perfect
(noiseless), in this work an additive noise channel with fixed power constraint
is considered; hence, the sensor has to encode its message before transmission.
Under some technical assumptions, we obtain the optimal encoding and estimation
policies in conjunction with the optimal transmission schedule. The impact of
the presence of a noisy channel is analyzed numerically based on dynamic
programming. This analysis yields some rather surprising results such as a
phase transition phenomenon in the number of used transmission opportunities,
which was not encountered in the noiseless communication setting.

equilibrium analysis usingmodel atmospheres, and thus, they represent the
largest homogeneous abundance data available for CH stars up to date. For this
reason, we can use the set to constrain the physics and the nucleosynthesis
occurring in low mass AGB stars. CH stars have been polluted in the past from
an already extinct AGB companion and thus show s-process enriched surfaces. We
discuss the effects induced on the surface AGB s-process distributions by
different prescriptions for convection and rotation. Our reference theoretical
FRUITY set fits only part of the observations. Moreover, the s-process
observational spread for a fixed metallicity cannot be reproduced. At Fe/H]>-1,
a good fit is found when rotation and a different treatment of the inner border
of the convective envelope are simultaneously taken into account. In order to
increase the statistics at low metallicities, we include in our analysis a
selected number of CEMP stars and, therefore, we compute additional AGB models
down to [Fe/H]=-2.85. Our theoretical models are unable to attain the large
[hs/ls] ratios characterizing the surfaces of those objects. We speculate on
the reasons for such a discrepancy, discussing the possibility that the

frameworks such as inner approximation algorithm, concave-convex procedure,
majorization-minimization algorithm, and successive convex approximation (SCA).
However, a large portion of existing algorithms arrive at a relatively generic
program at each iteration, which is less computationally efficient compared to
a more standard convex formulation. This paper proposes \emph{numerically
efficient} transformations and approximations for SCA-based methods to deal
with nonconvexity in wireless communications design. More specifically, the
central goal is to show that various nonconvex problems in wireless
communications can be iteratively solved by conic quadratic optimization. We
revisit various examples to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
approximations. Theoretical complexity analysis and numerical results show the
superior efficiency in terms of computational cost of our proposed solutions
compared to the existing ones.

this statistical finding confirms our previous simulation results obtained by
numerically solving five-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation of solar energetic

spin-valley coupling. Incontrast, for example, to gapless graphene the lateral
beam shift in gapped structures occurs not only in the case of total, but also
of partial, reflection, i.e. at the angles smaller than the critical angle of

structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space
parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a

compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and
subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional

many important circumstances, e.g. for a correct estimation of systemic risk.
It has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is
crucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however
unknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the
knowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the
strength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the
total number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational
requirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure
valid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that,
apart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network
is homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling
subsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of
sampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased
towards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our
core technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the
unknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data
sets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect
to the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever
the available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.

consistent with the fact that topological protection of the gapless Andreev

microlensing produced also by refraction of light due to either ionized, or

that the ray of light coming from the distant source traverses a gas cloud with
a King's density profile for various possible environments. We conclude that
the additional deviation due to relativistic refraction is in most cases

vertical gradient in the abundance of the related condensing species. On Earth,
the ensuing gradient of mean molecular weight has relatively few dynamical
consequences because N$_2$ is heavier than water vapor, so that only the
release of latent heat significantly impacts convection. On the contrary, in an
hydrogen dominated atmosphere (e.g. giant planets), all condensing species are
significantly heavier than the background gas. This can stabilize the
atmosphere against convection near a cloud deck if the enrichment in the given
species exceeds a critical threshold. This raises two questions. What is
transporting energy in such a stabilized layer, and how affected can the
thermal profile of giant planets be? To answer these questions, we first carry
out a linear analysis of the convective and double-diffusive instabilities in a
condensable medium showing that an efficient condensation can suppress
double-diffusive convection. This suggests that a stable radiative layer can
form near a cloud condensation level, leading to an increase in the temperature
of the deep adiabat. Then, we investigate the impact of the condensation of the
most abundant species---water---with a steady-state atmosphere model. Compared
to standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees
at the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have
many implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of
the atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for
example), and for their internal evolution.

sophisticated algorithmic methodologies for its storage, analysis, and

challenge. However, several hard to solve parallelization and load balancing
problems arise in this context. Here we discuss the HPC-oriented implementation
of a general purpose learning algorithm, originally conceived for DNA analysis
and recently extended to treat uncertainty on data (U BRAIN). The U-BRAIN
algorithm is a learning algorithm that finds a Boolean formula in disjunctive
normal form (DNF), of approximately minimum complexity, that is consistent with
a set of data (instances) which may have missing bits. The conjunctive terms of
the formula are computed in an iterative way by identifying, from the given
data, a family of sets of conditions that must be satisfied by all the positive
instances and violated by all the negative ones; such conditions allow the
computation of a set of coefficients (relevances) for each attribute (literal),
that form a probability distribution, allowing the selection of the term
literals. The great versatility that characterizes it, makes U-BRAIN applicable
in many of the fields in which there are data to be analyzed. However the
memory and the execution time required by the running are of O(n3) and of O(n5)
order, respectively, and so, the algorithm is unaffordable for huge data sets.

maximizing the similarity of the matched nodes and the edges between them. This
problem is encountered in a wide array of applications-from biological networks
to social networks to ontologies-where multiple networked data sources need to
be integrated. Due to the difficulty of the task, an accurate alignment can
rarely be found without human assistance. Thus, it is of great practical
importance to develop network alignment algorithms that can optimally leverage
experts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small number of
nodes. Yet, only a handful of existing works address this active network
alignment setting.
  The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (""are
nodes $a$ and $b$ the same or not?""), whereas we argue that it is generally
easier for a human expert to answer relative queries (""which node in the set
$\{b_1, \ldots, b_n\}$ is the most similar to node $a$?""). This paper
introduces two novel relative-query strategies, TopMatchings and
GibbsMatchings, which can be applied on top of any network alignment method
that constructs and solves a bipartite matching problem. Our methods identify
the most informative nodes to query by sampling the matchings of the bipartite
graph associated to the network-alignment instance.
  We compare the proposed approaches to several commonly-used query strategies
and perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our
sampling-based strategies yield the highest overall performance, outperforming
all the baseline methods by more than 15 percentage points in some cases. In
terms of accuracy, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings perform comparably. However,
GibbsMatchings is significantly more scalable, but it also requires
hyperparameter tuning for a temperature parameter.

Both lattice computations and heavy ion collision experiments however tell us
that, in the absence of chemical potentials, no plasma survives at $T <\sim
150$ MeV. The cosmological Quark-Hadron transition, however, seems to have been
a crossover; cosmological consequences envisaged when it was believed to be a
phase transition no longer hold. In this paper we discuss whether even a
crossover transition can leave an imprint that cosmological observations can
seek or, viceversa, there are questions cosmology should address to QCD
specialists. In particular, we argue that it is still unclear how baryons (not
hadrons) could form at the cosmological transition. A critical role should be
played by diquark states, whose abundance in the early plasma needs to be
accurately evaluated. We estimate that, if the number of quarks belonging to a
diquark state, at the beginning of the cosmological transition, is $<\sim
1:10^6$, its dynamics could be modified by the process of B-transfer from
plasma to hadrons. In turn, by assuming B-transfer to cause just mild
perturbations and, in particular, no entropy input, we study the deviations
from the tracking regime, in the frame of SCDEW models. We find that, in some
cases, residual deviations could propagate down to primeval nuclesynthesis.

wavelengths and thus an important part of the H.E.S.S. blazar program is
devoted to target of opportunity (ToO) observations. H.E.S.S. triggers blazar
ToOs on the basis of publicly available blazar observations at longer
wavelengths (optical, X-rays, and $\gamma$-rays), from private optical
observations with the ATOM telescope, and from private communications by
$\gamma$-ray partners in the context of MoUs. In 2015, about 70 hours of
H.E.S.S. data were taken in the form of blazar ToOs, which represents ~15$\%$
of all extragalactic observations. In this contribution, we present the
H.E.S.S. blazar ToO status, and we focus on two major results from the 2015
season: the detection of VHE emission from 3C 279 during the June 2015 flare,
and the discovery of PKS 0736+017 as a new VHE quasar.

these protocols were first implemented and used and later documented, other
were first specified and then implemented. Regardless of how protocols came to
be, their definitions can contain traps that lead to insecure implementations
or deployments. A classical example is insufficiently strict authentication
requirements in a protocol specification. The resulting Misconfigurations,
i.e., not enabling strong authentication, are common root causes for Internet
security incidents. Indeed, Internet protocols have been commonly designed
without security in mind which leads to a multitude of misconfiguration traps.
While this is slowly changing, to strict security considerations can have a
similarly bad effect. Due to complex implementations and insufficient
documentation, security features may remain unused, leaving deployments
vulnerable.
  In this paper we provide a systematization of the security traps found in
common Internet protocols. By separating protocols in four classes we identify
major factors that lead to common security traps. These insights together with
observations about end-user centric usability and security by default are then
used to derive recommendations for improving existing and designing new
protocols---without such security sensitive traps for operators, implementors

that of the Pmmn2 sheet. Nanoribbons derived from Pmmn8 are not only more

technological point of view. We find a rich variety of magnetic solutions,
depending on the borophene ""mother structure"", edge orientation, width and, in
the case of Pmmn8-derived BNRs, the sublattice of edge atoms. We show that one
can build BNRs with magnetic moment in both, one or none of the edges, as well
as with parallel or antiparallel magnetic coupling between the edges when
magnetic; moreover, their electronic character can be semiconducting, metallic
or half-metallic, creating a perfect spin valve at low bias. These different
behaviors are reflected in their densities of states, spin density and
electronic transport coefficients, which are analyzed in detail. Our work

offering strong evidence that NIR polarization traces the plane-of-sky B-field

this parameter is essential for a better understanding of the interstellar

appears to be the most reliable tracer to directly measure the gas kinetic
temperature.We aim to determine the kinetic temperature with spectral lines
from formaldehyde and to compare the results with those obtained from ammonia
lines for a large number of massive clumps.Three 218 GHz transitions
(JKAKC=303-202, 322-221, and 321-220) of para-H2CO were observed with the 15m
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) toward 30 massive clumps of the Galactic

model, we derive the gas kinetic temperature modeling the measured para-H2CO
322-221/303-202and 321-220/303-202 ratios. The gas kinetic temperatures derived
from the para-H2CO (321-220/303-202) line ratios range from 30 to 61 K with an
average of 46 K. A comparison of kinetic temperature derived from para-H2CO,
NH3, and the dust emission indicates that in many cases para-H2CO traces a
similar kinetic temperature to the NH3 (2,2)/(1,1) transitions and the dust
associated with the HII regions. Distinctly higher temperatures are probed by
para-H2CO in the clumps associated with outflows/shocks. Kinetic temperatures
obtained from para-H2CO trace turbulence to a higher degree than NH3
(2,2)/(1,1) in the massive clumps. The non-thermal velocity dispersions of
para-H2CO lines are positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperature. The
massive clumps are significantly influenced by supersonic non-thermal motions.

contributed to improving the performance of deep reinforcement learning. Yet,
its application to many practical settings is still limited by the memory

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) instead of recorded past experiences. The
RBM is trained online, and does not require the system to store any of the
observed data points. We compare OCD_GR to ER on 9 real-world datasets,
considering a worst-case scenario (data points arriving in sorted order) as
well as a more realistic one (sequential random-order data points). Our results
show that in 64.28% of the cases OCD_GR outperforms ER and in the remaining
35.72% it has an almost equal performance, while having a considerably reduced

methodology to the development of mathematical models to describe the
stimulus-response relationship of sensory neurons. Although there are a few
related studies in the computational neuroscience literature on this topic,
most of them are either involving non-linear static maps or simple linear
filters cascaded to a static non-linearity. Although the linear filters might
be appropriate to demonstrate some aspects of neural processes, the high level
of non-linearity in the nature of the stimulus-response data may render them
inadequate. In addition, modelling by a static non-linear input - output map
may mask important dynamical (time-dependent) features in the response data.
Due to all those facts a non-linear continuous time dynamic recurrent neural
network that models the excitatory and inhibitory membrane potential dynamics
is preferred. The main goal of this research is to estimate the parametric
details of this model from the available stimulus-response data. In order to
design an efficient estimator an optimal experiment design scheme is proposed
which computes a pre-shaped stimulus to maximize a certain measure of Fisher
Information Matrix. This measure depends on the estimated values of the
parameters in the current step and the optimal stimuli are used in a maximum
likelihood estimation procedure to find an estimate of the network parameters.
This process works as a loop until a reasonable convergence occurs. The
response data is discontinuous as it is composed of the neural spiking instants
which is assumed to obey the Poisson statistical distribution. Thus the
likelihood functions depend on the Poisson statistics. In order to validate the
approach and evaluate its performance, a comparison with another approach on
estimation based on randomly generated stimuli is also presented.

provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized
coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates
provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays.
The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of
pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider
an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements
- in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre
of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally,
the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can
recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory
responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically
plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from
different sources with different temporal delays and the particular
difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to
control its environment with delayed signals.

framework, the enthalpy-porosity model for multiphase flow in melting and
solidification problems can be employed. By considering the differentially
heated cavity and the melting of pure gallium in a rectangular enclosure, it is
shown that both boundary layers and sharp moving interior layers can be handled
naturally by the proposed class of non-conforming methods. Due to the
stabilising effect of the grad-div term and the robustness of discontinuous
Galerkin methods, it is possible to solve the underlying problems accurately on
coarse, non-adapted meshes. The interaction of heavy grad-div stabilisation and
discontinuous Galerkin methods significantly improves the mass conservation

anisotropic thermal expansion. The resistivity anisotropy and its corresponding
elastoresistivity exhibit very similar diverging behavior as those obtained
from piezo-stack experiments. This suggests that the resistivity anisotropy is
more a direct measure of magnetism than of nematicity, since the nematic
transition is no longer well-defined under a large strain. In strong contrast
to the large resistivity anisotropy above $T_{N}$, the anisotropy of the
in-plane magnetic susceptibility develops largely below $T_{N}$. Using an
itinerant model, we show that the observed anisotropy ($\chi_{b}>\chi_{a}$) is
determined by spin-orbit coupling and the orientation of the magnetic moments

flow-induced vibrations that can act as energy harvesting systems by converting
energy associated with the spontaneous cable motion into electricity. This work
investigates the optimal positioning of the harvesting devices along the cable,
using numerical simulations with a wake oscillator model to describe the
unsteady flow forcing. Using classical gradient-based optimization, the optimal
harvesting strategy is determined for the generic configuration of a flexible
cable fixed at both ends, including the effect of flow forces and gravity on
the cable's geometry. The optimal strategy is found to consist systematically
in a concentration of the harvesting devices at one of the cable's ends,
relying on deformation waves along the cable to carry the energy toward this
harvesting site. Furthermore, we show that the performance of systems based on
VIV of flexible cables is significantly more robust to flow velocity
variations, in comparison with a rigid cylinder device. This results from two
passive control mechanisms inherent to the cable geometry : (i) the
adaptability to the flow velocity of the fundamental frequencies of cables
through the flow-induced tension and (ii) the selection of successive vibration
modes by the flow velocity for cables with gravity-induced tension.

Removing that fiction raises the question of how prices are set and adjusted by

through a very basic model where a unique factor of production, labour,
produces a single consumption good, called jelly for brevity. The point of the
model is to study a price dynamics based on the firm's expectations about jelly
demand and labour supply. The system tends towards economic equilibrium,
however, depending on the initial conditions it might not get there. In
different model versions, different kinds of money are introduced. Compared to
the case of no money, the introduction of money as a store of value facilitates
the system reaching economic equilibrium. If money is introduced as a third

before the system relaxes into the vapor via cavitation, i.e., bubble
nucleation. Microscopic information on the cavitation process can be extracted
from experimental data by use of the nucleation theorem, which relates measured
cavitation rates to the size of the critical bubble. To apply the nucleation
theorem to experiments performed along an isochoric path, for instance, in
cavitation experiments in mineral inclusions, knowledge of the bubble entropy
is required. Using computer simulations, we compute the entropy of bubbles in
water as a function of their volume over a wide range of tensions from free
energy calculations. We find that the bubble entropy is an important
contribution to the free energy which significantly lowers the barrier to
bubble nucleation, thereby facilitating cavitation. Furthermore, the bubble
entropy per surface area depends on the curvature of the liquid--vapor
interface, decreasing approximately linearly with its mean curvature over the
studied range of bubble volumes. At room temperature, the entropy of a flat
liquid--vapor interface at ambient pressure is very similar to that of critical
bubbles over a wide range of tensions, which justifies the use of the former as
an approximation when interpreting data from experiments. Based on our
simulation results, we obtain an estimate for the volume of the critical bubble
from experimentally measured cavitation rates.

Transfer (DIAT) of facial attributes. Given the source input image and the
reference attribute, DIAT aims to generate a facial image that owns the
reference attribute as well as keeps the same or similar identity to the input
image. In general, our model consists of a mask network and an attribute
transform network which work in synergy to generate a photo-realistic facial
image with the reference attribute. Considering that the reference attribute
may be only related to some parts of the image, the mask network is introduced
to avoid the incorrect editing on attribute irrelevant region. Then the
estimated mask is adopted to combine the input and transformed image for
producing the transfer result. For joint training of transform network and mask
network, we incorporate the adversarial attribute loss, identity-aware adaptive
perceptual loss, and VGG-FACE based identity loss. Furthermore, a denoising
network is presented to serve for perceptual regularization to suppress the
artifacts in transfer result, while an attribute ratio regularization is
introduced to constrain the size of attribute relevant region. Our DIAT can
provide a unified solution for several representative facial attribute transfer
tasks, e.g., expression transfer, accessory removal, age progression, and
gender transfer, and can be extended for other face enhancement tasks such as
face hallucination. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Even for the identity-related attribute (e.g., gender), our
DIAT can obtain visually impressive results by changing the attribute while
retaining most identity-aware features.

complete mapping of electric field structure of the wakes has proven elusive.
Here we show that a high-energy electron bunch can be used to probe the fields

microscopic wakefield is reconstructed from the density modulated ultra-short
probe bunch after it has traversed the wake. This technique enables
visualization of linear wakefields in low-density plasmas that can accelerate

long relativistic electron bunch to probe the wake produced in a plasma by an
intense laser pulse or an ultra-short relativistic charged particle beam. As
the probe bunch traverses the wake, its momentum is modulated by the electric
field of the wake, leading to a density variation of the probe after free-space
propagation. This variation of probe density produces a snapshot of the wake

each individual (type), a best assortment of products, ads, or other offerings

management in e-commerce and online advertising where both items and types can
number in the millions.
  We formulate the dynamic assortment personalization problem as a
discrete-contextual bandit with $m$ contexts (types) and exponentially many
arms (assortments of the $n$ items). We assume that each type's preferences
follow a simple parametric model with $n$ parameters. In all, there are $mn$
parameters, and existing literature suggests that order optimal regret scales
as $mn$. However, the data required to estimate so many parameters is orders of
magnitude larger than the data available in most revenue management
applications; and the optimal regret under these models is unacceptably high.
  In this paper, we impose a natural structure on the problem -- a small latent
dimension, or low rank. In the static setting, we show that this model can be
efficiently learned from surprisingly few interactions, using a time- and
memory-efficient optimization algorithm that converges globally whenever the
model is learnable. In the dynamic setting, we show that structure-aware
dynamic assortment personalization can have regret that is an order of
magnitude smaller than structure-ignorant approaches. We validate our
theoretical results empirically.

This particular application of quantum techniques to cryptography was
originally proposed by Bennett, Brassard and Breidbart in 1982, even before

more demanding in terms of quantum capabilities: it requires the users to have
a quantum computer. In contrast, and like the original scheme by Bennett et
al., our new scheme merely requires to prepare and measure single BB84 qubits.
As such, we not only show a provably-secure scheme that is within reach of

bounds for the standardized aggregate wireless interference (AWI) in dense
K-tier HCNs are obtained for when base stations (BSs) in each tier are
distributed over the plane according to a spatial and general Poisson point
process. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance is used to measure deviations of
the distribution of the standardized AWI from the standard normal distribution.
An explicit and analytical expression bounding the KS distance between these
two distributions is obtained as a function of a broad range of network
parameters such as per-tier transmission power levels, per-tier BS intensity,
BS locations, general fading statistics, and general bounded path-loss models.
Bounds achieve a good statistical match between the standardized AWI
distribution and its normal approximation even for moderately dense HCNs.
Second, various spatial performance metrics of interest such as outage
capacity, ergodic capacity and area spectral efficiency in the downlink of
K-tier HCNs for general signal propogation models are investigated by making
use of the derived distribution approximation results. Considering two specific
BS association policies, it is shown that the derived performance bounds track
the actual performance metrics reasonably well for a wide range of BS
intensities, with the gap among them becoming negligibly small for denser HCN
deployments.

remarkable feature, independent of the different isotropic energy (E_iso) of

GRBs. This analysis is extended here to a new class of 161 long GRBs, all with
E_iso > 10^52 erg. These GRBs are indicated as binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe)
in view of their progenitors: a tight binary system composed of a carbon-oxygen
core (CO_core) and a neutron star undergoing an induced gravitational collapse
(IGC) to a black hole triggered by the CO_core explosion as a supernova (SN).
We confirm the universal behavior of the LXRE for the ""enlarged sample"" (ES) of
161 BdHNe observed up to the end of 2015, assuming a double-cone emitting
region. We obtain a distribution of half-opening angles peaking at 17.62
degrees, with a mean value of 30.05 degrees, and a standard deviation of 19.65
degrees. This, in turn, leads to the possible establishment of a new
cosmological candle. Within the IGC model, such universal LXRE behavior is only
indirectly related to the GRB and originates from the SN ejecta, of a standard
constant mass, being shocked by the GRB emission. The fulfillment of the
universal relation in the LXRE and its independence of the prompt emission,

cluster method, which will be useful to further discuss the so-called Pleiades
distance controversy and compare it with the very precise parallaxes from the
Gaia space mission.
  Methods: We apply a refurbished implementation of the convergent point search
method to an updated census of Pleiades stars to calculate the convergent point
position of the cluster from stellar proper motions. Then, we derive individual
parallaxes for 64 cluster members using radial velocities compiled from the
literature, and approximate parallaxes for another 1146 stars based on the
spatial velocity of the cluster. This represents the largest sample of Pleiades
stars with individual distances to date.
  Results: The parallaxes derived in this work are in good agreement with
previous results obtained in different studies (excluding Hipparcos) for
individual stars in the cluster. We report a mean parallax of $7.44\pm
0.08$~mas and distance of $134.4^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$pc that is consistent with the
weighted mean of $135.0\pm 0.6$pc obtained from the non-Hipparcos results in
the literature.
  Conclusions: Our result for the distance to the Pleiades open cluster is not
consistent with the Hipparcos catalog, but favors the recent and more precise
distance determination of $136.2\pm 1.2$pc obtained from Very Long Baseline
Interferometry observations. It is also in good agreement with the mean
distance of $133\pm 5$pc obtained from the first trigonometric parallaxes

advection-diffusion model of particle motion with a Poisson-Boltzmann cell
model of inter-particle interactions, to predict the concentration gradients
around a drying colloidal film. We then test these predictions with osmotic
compression experiments on colloidal silica, and small-angle x-ray scattering
experiments on silica dispersions drying in Hele-Shaw cells. Finally, we use
the details of the microscopic physics at play in these dispersions to explore
how two macroscopic mechanical instabilities -- shear-banding and fracture --
can be controlled.

  Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, Pescara, July 20-24",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vacuum instability of the strong electromagnetic field has been discussed
since long time ago. The instability of the strong electric field due to
creation of electron pairs is one of the examples, which is known as Schwinger
process. What matters are the coupling of particles to the electromagnetic
field and the mass of the particle to be produced. The critical electric field
for electrons in the minimal coupling is ~ m^2/e . Spin 1/2 neutral particles
but with magnetic dipole moments can interact with the electromagnetic field
through Pauli coupling. The instability of the particular vacuum under the
strong magnetic field can be formulated as the emergence of imaginary parts of
the effective potential. In this talk, the development of the imaginary part in
the effective potential as a function of the magnetic field strength is
discussed for the configurations of the uniform magnetic field and the
inhomogeneous magnetic field. Neutrinos are the lightest particle(if not photon
or gluon) in the ""standard model"", of which electromagnetic property is poorly
known experimentally. Recently the observation of neutrino oscillation shows
the necessity of neutrino masses. It implies that the standard model is
subjected to be modified such that non-trivial electromagnetic structure of
neutrino should be reconsidered although they are assigned to be neutral. And
the possibility of anomalous electromagnetic form factor is an open question
theoretically and experimentally. In this talk, the implication of
non-vanishing magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos is also discussed: the
instability of the strong magnetic field and the enhancement of neutrino
production in high energy collider experiments.

the 3D positions of acoustic reflectors given room impulse responses (RIRs). In
this article, we categorize these methods as ""image-source reversion"", which
localizes the image source before finding the reflector position, and ""direct
localization"", which localizes the reflector without intermediate steps. We
present five new contributions. First, an onset detector, called the clustered
dynamic programming projected phase-slope algorithm, is proposed to
automatically extract the time of arrival for early reflections within the RIRs
of a compact microphone array. Second, we propose an image-source reversion
method that uses the RIRs from a single loudspeaker. It is constructed by
combining an image source locator (the image source direction and range (ISDAR)
algorithm), and a reflector locator (using the loudspeaker-image bisection
(LIB) algorithm). Third, two variants of it, exploiting multiple loudspeakers,
are proposed. Fourth, we present a direct localization method, the ellipsoid
tangent sample consensus (ETSAC), exploiting ellipsoid properties to localize
the reflector. Finally, systematic experiments on simulated and measured RIRs
are presented, comparing the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art. ETSAC
generates errors lower than the alternative methods compared through our
datasets. Nevertheless, the ISDAR-LIB combination performs well and has a run

source state $|s\rangle$ to an unknown target state $|t\rangle$ using the
selective phase inversions, $I_{s}$ and $I_{t}$, of these two states. In one of
the generalizations of Grover's algorithm, $I_{s}$ is replaced by a general
diffusion operator $D_{s}$ having $|s\rangle$ as an eigenstate and $I_{t}$ is
replaced by a general selective phase rotation $I_{t}^{\phi}$. A fast quantum
search is possible as long as the operator $D_{s}$ and the angle $\phi$
satisfies certain conditions. These conditions are very restrictive in nature.
Specifically, suppose $|\ell\rangle$ denote the eigenstates of $D_{s}$
corresponding to the eigenphases $\theta_{\ell}$. Then the sum of the terms
$|\langle \ell|t\rangle|^{2}\cot(\theta_{\ell}/2)$ over all $\ell \neq s$ has
to be almost equal to $\cot(\phi/2)$ for a fast quantum search. In this paper,
we show that this condition can be significantly relaxed by introducing

performance of the sensor. Here we show that in nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy measurements using single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond, the NV sensor electron spin limits spectral resolution down to a few
hundred Hz, which constraints the characterization and coherent control of
finite spin systems, and furthermore, is insufficient for high resolution NMR
spectroscopy aiming at single molecule recognition and structure analysis of
the latter. To overcome the limitation, we support an NV electron spin sensor
with a nuclear spin qubit acting as quantum and classical memory allowing for
intermediate nonvolatile storage of metrology information, while suppressing
the deleterious back-action of the sensor onto the system under investigation.
We demonstrate quantum and classical memory lifetimes of 8 ms and 4 minutes
respectively under ambient conditions. Furthermore, we design and test
measurement and decoupling protocols, which exploit such memory qubits
efficiently. Using our hybrid quantum-classical sensor device, we achieve high
resolution NMR spectra with linewidths of single spins down to 13 Hz. Our work
is therefore a prerequisite for high resolution NMR spectroscopy on nanoscopic
quantum systems down to the single level.

number density of supermassive black holes in the early Universe by positing
that they grew from seed black holes with masses of $10^{4}$-$10^{5} \: {\rm
M_{\odot}}$ that formed by the quasi-isothermal collapse of gas in metal-free
protogalaxies cooled by atomic hydrogen emission. For this model to work,
H$_{2}$ formation must be suppressed in at least some of these systems by a
strong extragalactic radiation field. The predicted number density of DCBH
seeds is highly sensitive to the minimum value of the ultraviolet (UV) flux
required to suppress H$_{2}$ formation, $J_{\rm crit}$. In this paper, we
examine how the value of $J_{\rm crit}$ varies as we vary the strength of a
hypothetical high-redshift X-ray background. We confirm earlier findings that
when the X-ray flux $J_{\rm X}$ is large, the critical UV flux scales as
$J_{\rm crit} \propto J_{\rm X}^{1/2}$. We also carefully explore possible
sources of uncertainty arising from how the X-rays are modelled. We use a
reaction-based reduction technique to analyze the chemistry of H$_{2}$ in the
X-ray illuminated gas and identify a critical subset of 35 chemical reactions
that must be included in our chemical model in order to predict $J_{\rm crit}$
accurately. We further show that $J_{\rm crit}$ is insensitive to the details
of how secondary ionization or He$^{+}$ recombination are modelled, but does
depend strongly on the assumptions made regarding the column density of the
collapsing gas.

residual groups of the structure $Z_2\times CP$ in the neutrino and charged

parameters $\theta_{\nu}$ and $\theta_{l}$. This type of breaking pattern is
extended to the quark sector. In the second scheme, an abelian subgroup
contained in the flavor group is preserved by the charged lepton mass matrix

transformation, all lepton mixing parameter are determined in terms of three
free parameters $\theta_{1, 2, 3}$. We derive the most general criterion to
determine whether two distinct residual symmetries lead to the same mixing
pattern if the redefinition of the free parameters $\theta_{\nu, l}$ and
$\theta_{1, 2, 3}$ is taken into account. We have studied the lepton mixing
patterns arising from the flavor group $S_4$ and $CP$ symmetry which are
subsequently broken to all of the possible residual symmetries discussed in

model with the aid of the partial Hamiltonian approach and then compare our
results with those derived by the classical approach \cite{chil}. The partial
Hamiltonian approach provides two first integrals \cite{naz2016} in the case
where there are no parameter restrictions and these two first integrals are
utilized to construct three sets of closed form solutions for all the variables
in the model. First two first integrals are used to find two closed form
solutions, one of which is new to the literature. We then use only one of the
first integrals to derive a third solution that is the same as that found in
the previous literature. We also show that all three solutions converge to the
same long run balance growth path.

  laser with saturable absorber and delayed optical feedback","29 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.optics nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semiconductor lasers exhibit a wealth of dynamics, from emission of a
constant beam of light, to periodic oscillations and excitability. Self-pulsing
regimes, where the laser periodically releases a short pulse of light, are
particularly interesting for many applications, from material science to
telecommunications. Self-pulsing regimes need to produce pulses very regularly
and, as such, they are also known to be particularly sensitive to
perturbations, such as noise or light injection.
  We investigate the effect of delayed optical feedback on the dynamics of a
self-pulsing semiconductor laser with saturable absorber (SLSA). More
precisely, we consider the Yamada model with delay -- a system of three
delay-differential equations (DDEs) for two slow and one fast variable -- which
has been shown to reproduce accurately self-pulsing features as observed in
SLSA experimentally. This model is also of broader interest because it is quite
closely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as
excitable spiking neurons.
  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,
where we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the
strength of pumping as bifurcation parameters. We find a rapidly increasing
complexity of the system dynamics when the feedback delay is increased from
zero. In particular, there are new feedback-induced dynamics: stable
quasi-periodic oscillations on tori, as well as a large degree of
multistability, with up to five pulse-like stable periodic solutions with
different amplitudes and repetition rates. An attractor map in the plane of
perturbations on the gain and intensity reveals a Cantor set-like, intermingled
structure of the different basins of attraction. This suggests that, in
practice, the multistable laser is extremely sensitive to small perturbations.

random sequences generated by an m-Markov Chain (m-MC). It captures the
phenomenon that the probability distribution of the next state sometimes
depends on less than m of the preceding states. This allows compressing the
information needed to describe an m-MC. The SCOT construction has been earlier
used under various names: VLMC, VOMC, PST, CTW. In this paper we study the
possibility of reducing the m-MC to a 1-MC on the leaves of the SCOT. Such
context trees are called perfect-memory. We give various combinatorial
characterizations of perfect-memory context trees and an efficient algorithm to
find the minimal perfect-memory extension of a SCOT.

complex process and is dependent on range of geological and operating

non-harming or violent and catastrophic among different groups involved,

and research for a while now. This paper addresses issues associated with
stress redistribution during and after working cycle of EGS and gives a new
insight in understanding the behavior of stresses redistribution in and around
basement rock. As the basement rock is thermo-elastically connected to the
country rock, newly generated stresses interact with the existing in-situ
stresses under prevailing conditions of geological, design and operating
variables. Variables dictating the continuous, safe and efficient working of
EGS are also outlined in detailed sections. Guidelines for future of the
research related to stress redistribution in EGS are also part of this paper.

  Laser Observation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many standard robotic platforms are equipped with at least a fixed 2D laser
range finder and a monocular camera. Although those platforms do not have
sensors for 3D depth sensing capability, knowledge of depth is an essential
part in many robotics activities. Therefore, recently, there is an increasing
interest in depth estimation using monocular images. As this task is inherently
ambiguous, the data-driven estimated depth might be unreliable in robotics
applications. In this paper, we have attempted to improve the precision of
monocular depth estimation by introducing 2D planar observation from the
remaining laser range finder without extra cost. Specifically, we construct a
dense reference map from the sparse laser range data, redefining the depth
estimation task as estimating the distance between the real and the reference
depth. To solve the problem, we construct a novel residual of residual neural
network, and tightly combine the classification and regression losses for
continuous depth estimation. Experimental results suggest that our method
achieves considerable promotion compared to the state-of-the-art methods on
both NYUD2 and KITTI, validating the effectiveness of our method on leveraging
the additional sensory information. We further demonstrate the potential usage
of our method in obstacle avoidance where our methodology provides
comprehensive depth information compared to the solution using monocular camera
or 2D laser range finder alone.
