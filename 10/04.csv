tensors, provides a promising numerical tool for the study of strongly
correlated topological phases in two dimension. However, tensor network
representations may be vulnerable to instabilities caused by small
perturbations of the local tensor, especially when the local tensor is not
injective. For example, the topological order in tensor network representations
of the toric code ground state has been shown to be unstable under certain
small variations of the local tensor, if these small variations do not obey a
local $Z_2$ symmetry of the tensor. In this paper, we ask the questions of
whether other types of topological orders suffer from similar kinds of
instability and if so, what is the underlying physical mechanism and whether we
can protect the order by enforcing certain symmetries on the tensor. We answer
these questions by showing that the tensor network representation of all
string-net models are indeed unstable, but the matrix product operator (MPO)
symmetries of the local tensor can help to protect the order. We find that,
`stand-alone' variations that break the MPO symmetries lead to instability
because they induce the condensation of bosonic quasi-particles and destroy the
topological order in the system. Therefore, such variations must be forbidden
for the encoded topological order to be reliably extracted from the local
tensor. On the other hand, if a tensor network based variational algorithm is
used to simulate the phase transition due to boson condensation, then such
variation directions must be allowed in order to access the continuous phase
transition process correctly.

between remote locations with distinct Quality of Service (QoS) requirements

DPM is a lossless, network-aware protocol which tunes the telehaptic
packetization rate based on the level of congestion in the network. To monitor
the network congestion, we devise a novel network feedback module, which
communicates the end-to-end delays encountered by the telehaptic packets to the
respective transmitters with negligible overhead. Via extensive simulations, we
show that DPM meets the QoS requirements of telehaptic applications over a wide

of a real-time telepottery experiment with several human subjects, which reveal
that DPM preserves the quality of telehaptic activity even under heavily
congested network scenarios. Finally, we compare the performance of DPM with
several previously proposed telehaptic communication protocols and demonstrate

on galaxy stellar mass or observed wavelength. We study radial surface
brightness profiles of 753 galaxies, obtained from the $3.6 \mu m$ images of
the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G), and the
$K_s$-band data from the Near InfraRed S0-Sa galaxy Survey (NIRS0S), covering a
wide range of galaxy morphologies and stellar masses. Optical SDSS or Liverpool
telescope data was used for 480 of these galaxies. We find that in low-mass
galaxies the single exponential discs (Type I) are most common, and that their
fraction decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass. The fraction of
down-bending (Type II) discs increases with stellar mass, possibly due to more
common occurrence of bar resonance structures. The up-bending (Type III) discs
are also more common in massive galaxies. The observed wavelength affects the
scalelength of the disc of every profile type. Especially the scalelength of
the inner disc of Type II profiles increases from infrared to u-band on average
by a factor of $\sim 2.2$. Consistent with the previous studies, we find that
Type II outer disc scalelengths ($h_o$) in late-type and low-mass galaxies are
shorter in bluer wavelengths, possibly due to stellar radial migration
populating the outer discs with old stars. In Type III discs $h_o$ are larger
in the u-band, hinting to the presence of young stellar population in the outer
disc. While the observed wavelength affects the disc parameters, it does not
significantly affect the profile type in our sample. (Abridged)

emission has a minor contribution to the total reaction cross section, but it
may overcome evaporation and fission channels in the formation of light
nuclides. The role of mean-field dynamics and phase-space fluctuations in these
reactions is investigated through the Boltzmann-Langevin transport equation. We
found that a process of frustrated fragmentation and re-aggregation is a
prominent mechanism of production of IMFs which can not be assimilated to the
statistical decay of a compound nucleus. Very interestingly, this process may
yield a small number of IMF in the exit channel, which may even reduce to two,
and be wrongly confused with ordinary asymmetric fission. This interpretation,
inspired by nuclear-spallation experiments, can be generalised to heavy-ion
collisions approaching the fragmentation threshold.

using full detector simulations for several centre-of-mass energies. The
presented results provide crucial input to the energy staging strategy for the

Higgs boson couplings is presented in this contribution. The ultimate
measurement precision is reached when all measurements available at a given
centre-of-mass energy are included in combined fits. Operation at a few hundred
GeV allows the couplings and width of the Higgs boson to be determined in a
model-independent manner through the study of the Higgsstrahlung and WW-fusion
processes. At a lepton collider, the measurement of the Higgsstrahlung cross
section using the recoil mass technique sets the absolute scale for all Higgs
coupling measurements. Recently, it has been shown that including both the
leptonic and the hadronic decays of the Z boson in this approach improves the
statistical precision significantly. Operation at higher centre-of-mass
energies provides large statistics for the study of Higgs boson decays and the
potential to directly measure the top Yukawa coupling. At the highest

self-coupling can be determined with 10% precision.

learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention.
However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the
autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are
practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing
hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep
reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose
neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning
algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively
simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on
off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation
tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on
real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further
reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their
policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our
method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a
complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or

sourced by density perturbations via the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe
effect. Large voids and superclusters are excellent environments to make a
localized measurement of this tiny imprint. In some cases excess signals have
been reported. We probed these claims with an independent data set, using the
first year data of the Dark Energy Survey in a different footprint, and using a
different super-structure finding strategy. We identified 52 large voids and
102 superclusters at redshifts $0.2 < z < 0.65$. We used the Jubilee simulation
to a priori evaluate the optimal ISW measurement configuration for our
compensated top-hat filtering technique, and then performed a stacking
measurement of the CMB temperature field based on the DES data. For optimal
configurations, we detected a cumulative cold imprint of voids with $\Delta
T_{f} \approx -5.0\pm3.7~\mu K$ and a hot imprint of superclusters $\Delta
T_{f} \approx 5.1\pm3.2~\mu K$ ; this is $\sim1.2\sigma$ higher than the
expected $|\Delta T_{f}| \approx 0.6~\mu K$ imprint of such super-structures in
$\Lambda$CDM. If we instead use an a posteriori selected filter size
($R/R_{v}=0.6$), we can find a temperature decrement as large as $\Delta T_{f}

virus cap- sids makes the simplifying assumption that the configuration of the
intermediate states can be extracted directly from the final configuration of
the entire capsid. This assump- tion does not take into account the
conformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to
the binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until
stabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which
provides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and
the relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties
in their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger
capsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible
sub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this
assembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank
measure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the
sampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical
equilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both
associations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the
binding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed
significant departure from those one would obtain if only the static
configurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the
importance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a
statistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway
prediction with high statistical confidence.

scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes include, at the linearized level,
infinitesimal superrotations. These act like Virasoro generators on the
celestial sphere at null infinity. However, due to the singularities in these
generators, the physical status of finite superrotations has remained unclear.
Here we address this issue in the context of the breaking of a cosmic string
via quantum black hole pair nucleation. This process is described by a
gravitational instanton known as the $C$-metric. After pair production, the
black holes are pulled by the string to null infinity with a constant
acceleration. At late times the string decays and the spacetime settles into a
vacuum state. We show that the early and late spacetimes before and after
string decay differ by a finite superrotation. This provides a physical
interpretation of superrotations. They act on spacetimes which are
asymptotically flat everywhere except at isolated singularities with cosmic

limited number of RF chains, which improves the wireless security performance.
With imperfect channel state information (CSI), we analytically derive an
achievable lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate of any mobile terminal (MT),
for both analog and hybrid precoding schemes. The closed-form lower bound is
used to determine optimal power splitting between data and AN that maximizes
the secrecy rate through simple one-dimensional search. Analytical and
numerical results together reveal that the proposed hybrid precoder, although
suffers from reduced secrecy rate compared with theoretical full-dimensional
precoder, is free of the high computational complexity of large-scale matrix
inversion and null-space calculations, and largely reduces the hardware cost.

The most novel result is that magneto-optical effects produce, in the wings of

The outcome of this investigation suggests that the substitution of 10% Gd and

in a distributed or networked setting. Three aspects are notable: the variables
are usually associated with the nodes of a graph with limited communication
resources, hindering centralized control; the communication is subjected to
noise; and the number of variables can be very large. These three aspects make
tools and techniques from statistical physics particularly suitable for the
performance analysis of such networked systems in the limit of many variables
(analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical physics). Perhaps not
surprisingly, phase-transition like phenomena appear in these systems, where a
sharp change in performance can be observed with a smooth parameter variation,
with the change becoming discontinuous or singular in the limit of infinite
system size. In this paper we analyze the so called network consensus problem,
prototypical of the above considerations, that has been previously analyzed
mostly in the context of additive noise. We show that qualitatively new
phase-transition like phenomena appear for this problem in the presence of
multiplicative noise. Depending on dimensions and on the presence or absence of
a conservation law, the system performance shows a discontinuous change at a
threshold value of the multiplicative noise strength. In the absence of the
conservation law, and for graph spectral dimension less than two, the
multiplicative noise threshold (the stability margin of the control problem) is
zero. This is reminiscent of the absence of robust controllers for certain
classes of centralized control problems. Although our study involves a toy
model we believe that the qualitative features are generic, with implication
for the robust stability of distributed control systems, as well as the effect
of roundoff errors and communication noise on distributed algorithms.

extended structure (radio lobes) is detected for the first time in these
observations as a consequence of high dynamic range in the 327.5 and 1365 MHz

\times 10^{43} \rm{~ergs~s^{-1}} < \overline{Q} < 3.7 \times 10^{44}
\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$. Brightness temperature arguments indicate consistent values
of the time variability Doppler factor and the compactness Doppler factor for
the inner jet, $\delta \gtrsim 10$. Thus, the large apparent broadband
bolometric luminosity of the jet, $\sim 3 \times 10^{46}\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$,
corresponds to a modest intrinsic luminosity $\gtrsim
10^{42}\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$, or $\sim 1\%$ of $\overline{Q}$. In summary, we find
that 3C~273 is actually a ""typical"" radio loud quasar contrary to suggestions
in the literature. The modest $\overline{Q}$ is near the peak of the luminosity
distribution for radio loud quasars and it is consistent with the current rate
of dissipation emitted from millimeter wavelengths to gamma rays. The extreme
core-jet morphology is an illusion from a near pole-on line of sight to a
highly relativistic jet that produces a Doppler enhanced glow that previously
swamped the lobe emission. 3C~273 apparently has the intrinsic kpc scale
morphology of a classical double radio source, but it is distorted by an

blood vessels. Endothelial cells in the vessel network are viewed as linearly
elastic spheres and are of two types: vessel elements are contained within the
network; tip cells are located at endpoints. Tip cells move in response to
forces due to interactions with neighbouring vessel elements, the local tissue
environment, chemotaxis and a persistence force modeling their tendency to
continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements experience similar
forces but not chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing local
tissue interactions stabilises buckling instabilities due to proliferation.
Vessel elements proliferate, at rates that depend on their degree of stretch:
elongated elements proliferate more rapidly than compressed elements. Following
division, new cells are more likely to form new sprouts if the parent vessel is
highly compressed and to be incorporated into the parent vessel if it is
stretched.
  Model simulations reproduce key features of vasculogenesis. Parameter
sensitivity analyses reveal significant changes in network size and morphology
on varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of
the proliferation rate and sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying
chemotactic sensitivity also affects network directionality. Branching and
network density are influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs depicting
multiple network properties show how network quantities change over time and as
model parameters vary. We also show how glyphs constructed from in vivo data
could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and,
ultimately, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid
model generates vascular networks similar to those generated from in vitro and
in vivo experiments.

constraints between two agents that observe correlated data. The agents
alternately share data with one another for a total of K rounds such that each
agent initiates sharing over K/2 rounds. The interactions are modeled as a
collection of K random mechanisms (mappings), one for each round. The goal is
to jointly design the K private mechanisms to determine the set of all
achievable distortion-leakage pairs at each agent. Arguing that a mutual
information-based leakage metric can be appropriate for streaming data
settings, this paper: (i) determines the set of all achievable distortion-
leakage tuples ; (ii) shows that the K mechanisms allow for precisely composing
the total privacy budget over K rounds without loss; and (ii) develops
conditions under which interaction reduces the net leakage at both agents and
illustrates it for a specific class of sources. The paper then focuses on
log-loss distortion to better understand the effect on leakage of using a
commonly used utility metric in learning theory. The resulting interaction
problem leads to a non-convex sum-leakage-distortion optimization problem that
can be viewed as an interactive version of the information bottleneck problem.
A new merge-and-search algorithm that extends the classical agglomerative
information bottleneck algorithm to the interactive setting is introduced to
determine a provable locally optimal solution. Finally, the benefit of
interaction under log-loss is illustrated for specific source classes and the
optimality of one-shot is proved for Gaussian sources under both mean-square

Graph generators must also be able to produce such graphs at the scale of
real-world industry graphs, that is, hundreds of billions or trillions of

  In this paper, we propose Darwini, a graph generator that captures a number
of core characteristics of real graphs. Importantly, given a source graph, it
can reproduce the degree distribution and, unlike existing approaches, the
local clustering coefficient and joint-degree distributions. Furthermore,
Darwini maintains metrics such node PageRank, eigenvalues and the K-core

eight different orbital phases. Our Doppler maps show evolution from a one-arm

affect a disease. The genes, which we call predictor objects, can be measured
in different experiments on the same individual. We address the question of
finding which genes are predictors of disease by any of the experiments. Our
formulation is more general. In a given data set, there are a fixed number of
responses for each individual, which may include a mix of discrete, binary and
continuous variables. There is also a class of predictor objects, which may
differ within a subject depending on how the predictor object is measured,
i.e., depend on the experiment. The goal is to select which predictor objects
affect any of the responses, where the number of such informative predictor
objects or features tends to infinity as sample size increases. There are
marginal likelihoods for each way the predictor object is measured, i.e., for
each experiment. We specify a pseudolikelihood combining the marginal
likelihoods, and propose a pseudolikelihood information criterion. Under
regularity conditions, we establish selection consistency for the
pseudolikelihood information criterion with unbounded true model size, which
includes a Bayesian information criterion with appropriate penalty term as a
special case. Simulations indicate that data integration improves upon,
sometimes dramatically, using only one of the data sources.

resembles thermalization with the effective temperature set by the initial

typically involve a positive integer called ""Hermite rank"". There is a
different limit for each Hermite rank. From a statistical point of view,
however, we argue that a rank other than one is unstable, whereas, a rank equal
to one is stable. We provide empirical evidence supporting this argument. This
has important consequences. Assuming a higher-order rank when it is not really
there usually results in underestimating the order of the fluctuations of the

the sample variance, the empirical processes and the Whittle estimator.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements consider only the
overall optical depth to electron scattering ($\tau$), and further assume a
step-like reionization history. However, the polarization data contain
information beyond the overall optical depth, and the assumption of a step-like
function may miss high redshift contributions to the optical depth and lead to
biased $\tau$ constraints. Accounting for its full reionization information
content, we reconsider the interpretation of Planck 2015 Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI) polarization data using simple, yet physically-motivated
reionization models. We show that these measurements still, in fact, allow a
non-negligible contribution from metal-free (Pop-III) stars forming in
mini-halos of mass $M \sim 10^5-10^6 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 15$, provided this
mode of star formation is fairly inefficient. Our best fit model includes an
early, self-regulated phase of Pop-III star formation in which the reionization
history has a gradual, plateau feature. In this model, $\sim$20\% of the volume
of the universe is ionized by $z \sim 20$, yet it nevertheless provides a good
match to the Planck LFI measurements. Although preferred when the full
information content of the data is incorporated, this model would spuriously be
disfavored in the standard analysis. This preference is driven mostly by excess
power from E-mode polarization at multipoles of $10 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 20$,
which may reflect remaining systematic errors in the data, a statistical
fluctuation, or signatures of the first stars. Measurements from the Planck
High Frequency Instrument (HFI) should be able to confirm or refute this hint
and future cosmic-variance limited E-mode polarization surveys can provide
substantially more information on these signatures

angular resolution increases, the problem of surface finishing must be taken
seriously even in optical telescopes. From the optical design of the
instrument, reliable ray-tracing routines allow computing and display of the
PSF based on geometrical optics. However, such an approach does not directly
account for the scattering caused by surface microroughness, which is
interferential in nature. Although the scattering effect can be separately
modeled, its inclusion in the ray-tracing routine requires assumptions that are
difficult to verify. In that context, a purely physical optics approach is more
appropriate as it remains valid regardless of the shape and size of the defects
appearing on the optical surface. Such a computation, when performed in
two-dimensional consideration, is memory and time consuming because it requires
one to process a surface map with a few micron resolution, and the situation
becomes even more complicated in case of optical systems characterized by more
than one reflection. Fortunately, the computation is significantly simplified
in far-field configuration, since the computation involves only a sequence of
Fourier Transforms. In this paper, we provide validation of the PSF simulation
with Physical Optics approach through comparison with real PSF measurement data
in the case of ASTRI-SST M1 hexagonal segments. These results represent a first
foundation stone for future development in a more advanced computation taking
into account microroughness and multiple reflection in optical systems.

the TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in
great detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy
thresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.
protons with kinetic energies down to $\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different
nuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low
momentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a
powerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas
mixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since
the beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,
neutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding
scintillator-based detectors. We expect about 600 such events in the recorded

events from the background and thus demonstrate the viability of using gaseous
argon as a target for a neutrino beam. This enables us to do a cross- section

field galaxies in the Local Group. Such satellites would be subject to weaker
environmental influences than Milky Way satellites, and could lead to new
insights on low mass galaxy formation. In this paper, we predict the number of
luminous satellites expected around field dwarf galaxies by applying several
abundance matching models and a reionization model to the dark-matter only
\textit{Caterpillar} simulation suite. For three of the four abundance matching
models used, we find a $>99\%$ chance that at least one satellite with stellar
mass $M_*> 10^5\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ exists around the combined five Local
Group field dwarf galaxies with the largest stellar mass. When considering
satellites with $M_*> 10^4\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, we predict a combined $5-25$
satellites for the five largest field dwarfs, and $10-50$ for the whole Local
Group field dwarf population. Because of the relatively small number of
predicted dwarfs, and their extended spatial distribution, a large fraction
each Local Group dwarf's virial volume will need to be surveyed to guarantee
discoveries. We compute the predicted number of satellites in a given field of
view of specific Local Group galaxies, as a function of minimum satellite
luminosity, and explicitly obtain such values for the Solitary Local dwarfs
survey. Uncertainties in abundance matching and reionization models are large,

contains galaxies within the GALEX footprint, regardless of a UV detection,
covering 90% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical SED
fitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al. (2007), with
improvements such as blending corrections for low-resolution UV photometry,
flexible dust attenuation laws, and emission line corrections. GSWLC includes
mid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based upon 22 micron WISE observations.
These estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate
possible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs
(SSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of
SFRs. SSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the
mid-IR SSFRs, and to SSFRs from three published catalogs. For ""main sequence""
galaxies with no AGN contribution all SSFRs are in very good agreement (within
0.1 dex on average). In particular, the widely-used aperture-corrected SFRs
from MPA/JHU catalog show no systematic offsets, in contrast to some
integral-field spectroscopy results. For galaxies below the main sequence (log
SSFR<-11), mid-IR (S)SFRs based on fixed luminosity-SFR conversion are severely
biased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars.
Furthermore, mid-IR (S)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies
with AGN, presumably due to non-stellar dust heating. UV/optical (S)SFRs are
thus preferred to IR-based (S)SFRs for quenched galaxies and those which host
AGN.

planet's mass versus semimajor axis parameter space according to the dominant
outcome for scattered objects: ejected, accreted, remaining, escaping, Oort
Cloud, depleted Oort Cloud. We use these outcomes to consider which planetary
system architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given
that signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal
architectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most
readily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection
method and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at
4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au
contrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could
indicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles
maximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated
planets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet
masses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on
comets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass
planets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejector and architectures
that maximise the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris disks are usually
considered classical Kuiper belt analogues. Here we consider the possibility of
detecting scattered disk analogues, which could be betrayed by a broad radial
profile and lack of small grains, as well as spherical 100-1000au mini-Oort
Clouds. Some implications for escaping planets around young stars, detached
planets akin to Sedna, and the formation of super-Earths, are also discussed.

detected out to a radius of 970 AU, while the millimeter continuum emission is
truncated at just 313 AU. Based upon this data, we have built a comprehensive
physical and chemical model for the disk structure, which takes into account
the complex, coupled nature of the gas and dust and the interplay between the
local and external environment. We constrain the distributions of gas and dust,
the gas temperatures, the CO abundances, the CO optical depths, and the
incident external radiation field. We find that the reduction/removal of dust
from the outer disk exposes this region to higher stellar and external
radiation and decreases the rate of freeze-out, allowing CO to remain in the
gas out to large radial distances. We estimate a gas-phase CO abundance of
$5\%$ of the ISM value and a low external radiation field ($G_0\lesssim4$). The
latter is consistent with that expected from the local stellar population. We
additionally find tentative evidence for ring-like continuum substructure,
suggestions of isotope-selective photodissociation, and a diffuse gas halo.

it is composed of two distinct, blueshifted clumps south of the nucleus and a
series of low-significance redshifted clumps extending toward a nearby
companion galaxy. The velocity of the redshifted clouds increases with radius
to a value consistent with the companion galaxy, suggesting that an interaction
between these galaxies <20 Myr ago disrupted a pre-existing molecular gas
reservoir within the BCG. Most of the molecular gas, (7.8+/-0.9) x 10^8 M_sun,

Myr. The filament trails an X-ray cavity, suggesting that the gas has cooled
from low entropy gas that has been lifted out of the cluster core and become
thermally unstable. We are unable to distinguish between inflow and outflow
along the filament with the present data. Cloud velocities along the filament
are consistent with gravitational free-fall near the plane of the sky, although
their increasing blueshifts with radius are consistent with outflow.

surrounded by a slower sheath or layer. This structured jet model explains some
properties of their emission and morphology. Because of their relative motion,
the radiation produced by one component is seen amplified by the other, thus
enhancing the inverse Compton emission of both. Radiation is emitted
anisotropically in the comoving frames, and causes the emitting plasma to
recoil. As seen in the observer frame, this corresponds to a deceleration of
the fastest component (the spine) and an acceleration of the slower one (the
layer). While the deceleration of the spine has already been investigated, here
we study for the first time the acceleration of the sheath and find
self-consistent velocity profile solutions for both the spine and the sheath
while accounting for radiative cooling. We find that the sheath can be
accelerated to the velocities required by the observations if its leptons
remain energetic in the acceleration region, assumed to be of the order of 100
Schwarzschild radii, demanding continuous injection of energetic particles in
that region.

used the unpolarized stars to test the time stability of the PMOS mode, and
found a small ($\leq$0.1%), but statistically significant, on-axis instrumental
polarization wavelength dependency, possibly caused by the tilted surfaces of
the dispersive element. The polarization degree and angle are found to be
stable at the level of $\leq$0.1% and $\leq$0.2 degrees, respectively. We

to few tens of GeV and beyond 100 TeV. To achieve this goal, an array of about

thousands of square meters. Thence, the optimal technology used for CTA mirrors
manufacture should be both low-cost (~1000 euros/m2) and allow high optical

higher than 85% and a PSF (Point Spread Function) diameter smaller than 1 mrad.
Surface roughness can significantly contribute to PSF broadening and limit
telescope performances. Fortunately, manufacturing techniques for mirrors are
now available to keep the optical scattering well below the
geometrically-predictable effect of figure errors. This paper determines first
order surface finish tolerances based on a surface microroughness
characterization campaign, using Phase Shift Interferometry. That allows us to
compute the roughness contribution to Cherenkov telescope PSF. This study is
performed for diverse mirror candidates (MAGIC-I and II, ASTRI, MST) varying in

  Segmentation?","To appear at ECCV 2016 Workshop on Video Segmentation",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For state-of-the-art semantic segmentation task, training convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) requires dense pixelwise ground truth (GT) labeling,
which is expensive and involves extensive human effort. In this work, we study
the possibility of using auxiliary ground truth, so-called \textit{pseudo
ground truth} (PGT) to improve the performance. The PGT is obtained by
propagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video
using a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is
to demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of
a CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that
needs to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we
explore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT
labeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different
compared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT.
We conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of
labeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is
multiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in
improving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the
performance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by
$2.7\%$ on IoU accuracy. We believe such an approach can be used to train CNNs
for semantic video segmentation where sequentially labeled image frames are
needed. To this end, we provide recommendations for using PGT strategically for
semantic segmentation and hence bypass the need for extensive human efforts in
labeling.

linear sketches of the original high-dimensional observations. The premise is
that when the sketching matrix is a random Gaussian matrix, and the dimension
of the sketching vector is sufficiently large, the rank of sample covariance
matrix for these sketches equals the rank of the original sample covariance
matrix with high probability. Hence, we may be able to detect the low-rank

recover the original covariance matrix. We character the performance of the
largest eigenvalue statistic in terms of the false-alarm-rate and the expected

in simple plane wave solutions, starting from smooth initial conditions, is
stable under perturbations that break the plane symmetry. Moreover, we provide
a sharp asymptotic description of the singularity formation. The new feature of
our work is that the perturbed solutions are allowed to have small but non-zero
vorticity, even at the location of the shock. Thus, our results provide the
first constructive description of the vorticity near a singularity formed from
compression: relative to a system of geometric coordinates adapted to the
acoustic characteristics, the vorticity remains many times differentiable, all
the way up to the shock. In addition, relative to the Cartesian coordinates,
the vorticity remains bounded up to the shock.
  To control the vorticity, we rely on a coalition of new geometric and
analytic insights that complement the ones used by Christodoulou in his
groundbreaking, sharp proof of shock formation in vorticity-free regions. In
particular, we rely on a new formulation of the compressible Euler equations
exhibiting remarkable structures. To derive estimates, we construct an eikonal
function adapted to the acoustic characteristics (which correspond to sound
wave propagation) and a related set of geometric coordinates and differential
operators. Thanks to the remarkable structure of the equations, the same set of
coordinates and differential operators can be used to analyze the vorticity,
whose characteristics are transversal to the acoustic characteristics. In
particular, our work provides the first constructive description of shock

remarkable structures, including surprisingly good null structures. The new
formulation comprises covariant wave equations for the Cartesian components of
the velocity and the logarithmic density coupled to a transport equation for
the specific vorticity, defined to be vorticity divided by density. The
equations allow one to use the full power of the geometric vectorfield method
in treating the ""wave part"" of the system.
  A crucial feature of the new formulation is that all derivative-quadratic
inhomogeneous terms verify the strong null condition. The latter is a nonlinear
condition signifying the complete absence of nonlinear interactions involving
more than one differentiation in a direction transversal to the acoustic
characteristics. Moreover, the same good structures are found in the equations
verified by the Euclidean divergence and curl of the specific vorticity. This
is important because one needs to combine estimates for the divergence and curl
with elliptic estimates to obtain sufficient regularity for the specific
vorticity, whose derivatives appears as inhomogeneous terms in the wave
equations.
  The above structures collectively open the door for our forthcoming results:
exhibiting a stable regime in which initially smooth solutions develop a shock
singularity (in particular the first Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives
of the velocity and density blow up) while, relative to a system of geometric
coordinates adapted to the acoustic characteristics, the solution (including
the vorticity) remains many times differentiable, all the way up to the shock.
The good null structures, which are often associated with global solutions, are
in fact key to proving that the shock singularity forms. Our secondary goal in
this article is to overview the central role that the structures play in the
proof.

gravitational-wave (GW) signal of the inspiral. Previous studies of this type
treated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected
superfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is
fundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy
is due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid
core it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields
a stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum
of g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo
resonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW
detectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is
transferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather
than a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in
the inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in
the gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS
(about 0.001-0.01 rad). A phase error of this magnitude is too small to be
measured from a single event with the current generation of GW detectors.

because of their remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). To
further improve the device performance, however, it is imperative to obtain
fundamental understandings on the photo-response and long-term stability down
to the microscopic level. Here, we report the first quantitative nanoscale
photoconductivity imaging on two methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) thin
films with different PCEs by light-stimulated microwave impedance microscopy.
The intrinsic photo-response is largely uniform across grains and grain
boundaries, which is direct evidence on the inherently benign nature of
microstructures in the perovskite thin films. In contrast, the carrier mobility
and lifetime are strongly affected by bulk properties such as the sample
crystallinity. As visualized by the spatial evolution of local
photoconductivity, the degradation due to water diffusion through the capping
layer begins with the disintegration of large grains rather than the nucleation
and propagation from grain boundaries. Our findings provide new insights to
improve the electro-optical properties of MAPbI3 thin films towards large-scale
commercialization.

the maximum cardinality of a $k$-uniform $t$-intersecting family on $n$ points,
and describes all optimal families. We extend this theorem to several other
settings: the weighted case, the case of infinitely many points, and the
Hamming scheme.
  The weighted Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem gives the maximal $\mu_p$ measure
of a $t$-intersecting family on $n$ points, where $\mu_p(A) = p^{|A|}
(1-p)^{n-|A|}$. As has been observed by Ahlswede and Khachatrian and by Dinur
and Safra, this theorem can be derived from the classical one by a simple
reduction. However, this reduction fails to identify the optimal families, and
only works for $p < 1/2$. We translate the two original proofs of Ahlswede and
Khachatrian to the weighted case, thus identifying the optimal families in all
cases. We also extend the theorem to the case $p > 1/2$, using a different
technique of Ahlswede and Khachatrian (the case $p = 1/2$ is Katona's
intersection theorem). We then extend the weighted Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem
to the case of infinitely many points.
  The Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem on the Hamming scheme gives the maximum
cardinality of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ in which any two elements $x,y$
have $t$ positions $i_1,\ldots,i_t$ such that $x_{i_j} - y_{i_j} \in
\{-(s-1),\ldots,s-1\}$. We show that this case corresponds to $\mu_p$ with $p =
s/m$, extending work of Ahlswede and Khachatrian, who considered the case $s =
1$. We also determine the maximum cardinality families. We obtain similar
results for subsets of $[0,1]^n$, though in this case we are not able to
identify all maximum cardinality families.

any time-dependent process in the total system $S+M$ is divisible into parts

executing movements to attain specific goals. This range of movement is limited
by a number of mechanical, biomechanical, or cognitive constraints. Shifts in
these limits result in changes available possible movements from which a
subject can select and can affect which movements a subject selects. Therefore
by understanding the limits on the range of movement we can come to a better
understanding of declines in movement performance due to disease or aging. In
this project, we look at how models for the limits on the range of movement can
be derived in a principled manner from a model of the movement. Using the
example of normal walking gaits, we develop a lower limit on the avg. walking
speed by examining the process by which the body restores mechanical energy
lost during walking, and we develop an upper limit on the avg. step length by
examining the forces the body can exert doing external mechanical work, in this
case, pulling a cart. Making slight changes to the model for normal walking
gaits, we develop a model of very slow walking gaits with avg. walking speeds
below the lower limit on normal walking gaits but that also has a lower limit
on the avg. walking speed. We note that the lowest avg. walking speeds observed
clinically fall into the range of very slow walking gaits so defined, and argue
that forms of bipedal locomotion with still lower speeds should be considered
distinct from walking gaits.

an appropriate all-or-none signal for organelle degradation. We explore this
proposal using a computational model restricted to peroxisomes and the
relatively well characterized pexophagy receptor proteins NBR1 and p62. We find
that larger peroxisomes nucleate NBR1 clusters first and lose them last through
competitive coarsening. This results in significant size-selectivity that
favors large peroxisomes, and can explain the increased catalase signal that
results from siRNA inhibition of p62. Excess ubiquitin, resulting from damaged
organelles, suppresses size-selectivity but not cluster formation. Our proposed
selectivity mechanism thus allows all damaged organelles to be degraded, while
otherwise selecting only a portion of organelles for degradation.

but there are few analytic or even semi-analytic theories for the correlation
function and multiplicity of stars. In this paper we present such a theory,
based on our recently-developed semi-analytic framework called MISFIT, which
models gravito-turbulent fragmentation, including the suppression of
fragmentation by protostellar radiation feedback. We compare the results
including feedback to a control model in which it is omitted. We show that both
classes of models robustly reproduce the stellar correlation function at >0.01
pc scales, which is well approximated by a power-law that follows generally
from scale-free physics (turbulence plus gravity) on large scales. On smaller
scales protostellar disk fragmentation becomes dominant over common core
fragmentation, leading to a steepening of the correlation function.
Multiplicity is more sensitive to feedback: we found that a model with the
protostellar heating reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions and mass
ratio distributions for both Solar and sub-Solar mass stars (in particular the
brown dwarf desert), while a model without feedback fails to do so. The model
with feedback also produces an at-formation period distribution consistent with
the one inferred from observations. However, it is unable to produce
short-range binaries below the length scale of protostellar disks. We suggest
that such close binaries are produced primarily by disk fragmentation and
further decrease their separation through orbital decay.

competition between magnetic exchange interactions differing by their range and
sign, such as nearest-neighbor and next-nearest- neighbor interactions. Since
the latter are usually weak the onset temperatures for multiferroism via this
mechanism are typically low. By considering a realistic model for YBaCuFeO$_5$
we propose an alternative mechanism for magnetic-spiral order, and hence for
multiferroism, that occurs at much higher temperatures. We show using
Monte-Carlo simulations and electronic structure calculations based on density
functional theory that the Heisenberg model on a geometrically non-frustrated
lattice with only nearest-neighbor interactions can have a spiral phase up to
high temperature when frustrating bonds are introduced randomly along a single
crystallographic direction as caused, e.g., by a particular type of chemical
disorder. This long-range correlated pattern of frustration avoids
ferroelectrically inactive spin glass order. Finally, we provide an intuitive
explanation for this mechanism and discuss its generalization to other
materials.

three-dimensional classical XY ferromagnets upon substitution of a small subset
of equally oriented bonds by impurity bonds, on which the ferromagnetic
exchange J_perp > 0 is replaced by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling J_imp <
0. In the presence of a single impurity bond, once the absolute value of the
frustrating coupling J_imp < 0 exceeds a threshold J_c > 0, the ground state
becomes two-fold degenerate, corresponding to either clockwise or anticlockwise
canting of the spins in the vicinity of the impurity bond. In the presence of a
small concentration of impurity bonds, the effective low-energy Hamiltonian is
that of Ising variables encoding the sense of rotation of the local canting
around the impurities. Those degrees of freedom interact through a dipolar
interaction mediated by spin waves. A ferromagnetic Ising ground state
indicates the instability of the XY ferromagnet towards a spiral state with a
wave vector proportional to the concentration of impurity bonds. To analyze
under which circumstances such a ground state arises, we study first impurities
forming superlattices. For a subclass of those, we can rigorously establish the
existence of spiral order. For another class of superlattices, the Ising
variables order ferromagnetically in planes perpendicular to the orientation of
impurity bonds, but antiferromagnetically parallel to it, which results in a
fan-like XY ground state. Second, we consider the case when the impurity bonds
are randomly distributed on the three-dimensional host lattice according to a
Poisson process. We show the phenomenon of spiral order by disorder with an
ordering wave vector proportional to the impurity concentration. The analytical
predictions are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations and are relevant for
magnetic materials such as YBaCuFeO_5.

flow. As was already suggested by Marumori and Watanabe, the internal
rotational motion, i.e., the vortex motion, however, may exist also in nuclei.
So, we have a necessity of taking the vortex motion into consideration. In a
classical fluid dynamics, there are various ways to treat the internal
rotational velocity. The Clebsch representation, v(x) = -\nabla \phi(x) +
\lambda(x) \nabla \psi(x) (\phi ; velocity potential, \lambda and \psi: Clebsch
parameters) is very powerful and has an advantage deriving equations of fluid
motion from a Lagransian. Making the best use of the advantage,
Kronig-Thellung, Ziman and Ito obtained a Hamiltonian including the internal
rotational motion, the vortex motion, through the term \lambda(x) \nabla
\psi(x). Going to quantum fluid dynamics, Ziman and Thellung finally derived a
roton spectrum of liquid Helium II postulated by Landau. Is it possible to
apply such the manner to a description of the collective vortex motion in
nuclei? The description of such a collective motion has never been treated in
the Bohr-Mottelson model (BMM) for a long time. In this paper, we will
investigate a possibility of describing the vortex motion in nuclei basing on
the theories of Ziman and Ito together with Marumori's work.

obtained through a multi-period Monte Carlo simulation that considers the
probability of default (PD) of the banks and their tendency of defaulting in
the same time interval. A contagion process increases the PD of banks exposed
toward distressed counterparties. The systemic risk is measured by statistics
of the loss distribution, while the contribution of each node is quantified by
the new measures PDRank and PDImpact. We illustrate how the model works on the
network of the European Global Systemically Important Banks. For a certain
range of the banks' capital and of their assets volatility, our results reveal
the emergence of a strong contagion regime where lower default correlation
between banks corresponds to higher losses. This is the opposite of the
diversification benefits postulated by standard credit risk models used by
banks and regulators who could therefore underestimate the capital needed to
overcome a period of crisis, thereby contributing to the financial system
instability.

galaxies (M$_{B}\lesssim-$20.5 mag), and typically smaller than 1 kpc. In one
popular scenario, supermassive black hole binaries --- established during dry
(i.e. gas-poor) galaxy mergers --- kick out the stars from a galaxy's central
region via three-body interactions. Here, this ""binary black hole scouring
scenario"" is probed at its extremes by investigating the two galaxies reported
to have the largest partially-depleted cores found to date:
2MASX~J09194427+5622012 and 2MASX~J17222717+3207571 (the brightest galaxy in
Abell~2261). We have fit these galaxy's two-dimensional light distribution
using the core-S\'{e}rsic model, and found that the former galaxy has a
core-S\'{e}rsic break radius $R_{b,cS}=0.55$~kpc, three times smaller than the
published value. We use this galaxy to caution that other reportedly large
break radii may too have been over-estimated if they were derived using the
""sharp-transition"" (inner core)-to-(outer S\'{e}rsic) model. In the case of
2MASX~J17222717+3207571, we obtain $R_{b,cS}=3.6$~kpc. While we confirm that
this is the biggest known partially-depleted core of any galaxy, we stress that
it is larger than expected from the evolution of supermassive black hole
binaries --- unless one invokes substantial gravitational-wave-induced (black
hole)-recoil events. Given the presence of multiple nuclei located (in
projection) within the core radius of this galaxy, we explored and found
support for the alternative ""stalled infalling perturber"" core-formation
scenario, in which this galaxy's core could have been excavated by the action
of an infalling massive perturber.

transmission by applying magnetic field to 7 T, an effect which we believe is
due to the suppression of topological surface states. This suppression is
essentially independent of the thicknesses of the samples, showing the
two-dimensional nature of the transport. The suppression of surface states in
field allows us to use the crystal slab itself as a reference sample to extract
the surface conductance, mobility, charge density and scattering rate. Our
measurements set the stage for the investigation of phenomena out of the

for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data.
Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be
classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and
sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity
and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on
what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts
for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric
representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these
permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical
implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the
sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions.
This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic
simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We
take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the
necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical
properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the
resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the
electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part

continuous map on the interval according as if $n$ is a successor of the
minimal period of the map in Sharkovski ordering. We pursue classification of
second minimal $7$-orbits in terms of cyclic permutations and digraphs. It is
proved that there are 9 types of second minimal orbits with accuracy up to
inverses. The result is applied to the problem on the distribution of periodic
windows within the chaotic regime of the bifurcation diagram of the
one-parameter family of unimodal maps. It is revealed that by fixing the
maximum number of appearances of the periodic windows there is a universal
pattern of distribution. In particular, the first appearance of all the orbits
is always a minimal orbit, while the second appearance is a second minimal
orbit. It is observed that the second appearance of 7-orbit is a second minimal
7-orbit with Type 1 digraph. The reason for the relevance of the Type 1 second
minimal orbit is the fact that the topological structure of the unimodal map
with single maximum is equivalent to the structure of the Type 1 piecewise
monotonic endomorphism associated with the second minimal 7-orbit. Yet another
important report of this paper is the revelation of the universal pattern
dynamics with respect to increased number of appearances.

described using the metaphor of a noise filter. Cellular systems need accurate,

reaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy
representations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only
filter the noise, but also predict the current state of the environment based
on information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea
of a biochemical noise filter is actually more than just a metaphor: we
describe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between
signaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal
noise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and
Bode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to
derive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the
environmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It
helps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response
times of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate. The theory
also provides insights into how evolution may have tuned enzyme kinetic

degeneracy formation that has not previously been studied for quasilinear wave
equations. Specifically, using only energy methods and ODE-type techniques, we
exhibit an open (in an appropriate Sobolev topology) set of data such that
$\Psi$ is initially near $0$ while $1 + \Psi$ vanishes in finite time. In fact,
generic data profiles, when appropriately rescaled, lead to the vanishing of $1

the following sense: there is a high-order energy, featuring degenerate weights
only at the top order, that remains bounded up to the time of first vanishing.
When $P=1$, we show that any $C^1$ extension of $\Psi$ to the future of a point
where $1 + \Psi = 0$ must exit the regime of hyperbolicity. Moreover, the
Kretschmann scalar (which is a curvature invariant) of the Lorentzian metric
corresponding to the wave equation blows up at those points. In particular, our
results show that curvature blowup for the metric of a quasilinear wave
equation does not always coincide with singularity formation in the solution

revealed the elliptical shape of the clump. Position-velocity (PV) diagram
taken along its major axis exhibits two well-defined peaks symmetrically
located with respect to the clump center, which is similar to that found for a

by N. Ohashi and his collaborators, indicating that the cluster-forming clump
is also collapsing by the self-gravity toward the clump center. With analogue
to Ohashi's model, we made a simple model of an infalling, rotating clump to
fit the observed data. Based on the inferred model parameters as well as
results of earlier observations and simulations in the literature, we discuss
structures of the clump such as the relation among the global mass infall rate
(~10^-3 Mo/yr), formation of a compact core (with a mass and size of ~4 Mo and

is to find necessary and sufficient condition for a system to synchronize on a

understand exactly how the nonlienar interaction between local entities evolves
over the underlying graph. Another open question is to obtain bounds on the
time complexity of synchronization, which has important practical implications
in clock synchronization algorithms. We address these questions for
one-parameter family of discrete pulse-coupled inhibitory oscillatorscalled the
$\kappa$-color firefly cellular automata (FCA). Namely, we show that for
$\kappa\le 6$, recurrence of each oscillator is a necessary and sufficient
condition for synchronization on finite trees, while for $\kappa \ge 7$ this
condition is only necessary. As a corollary, we show that any non-synchronizing
dynamics for $\kappa\le 6$ on trees decompose into synchronized subtrees
partitioned by `dead' oscillators. Furthermore, on trees with diameter $d$ and
maximum degree at most $\kappa$, we show that the worst-case number of
iterations until synchronization is of order $O(\kappa d)$ for $\kappa\in
\{3,4,5\}$, $O(\kappa d^{2})$ for $\kappa=6$, and infinity for $\kappa \ge 7$.
Lastly, we report simulation results of FCA on lattices and conjecture that on

quantum phenomena in magnonics. A key ingredient for future quantum magnonics
systems is the ability to probe magnon states. Here we observe individual
magnons in a millimeter-sized ferromagnet coherently coupled to a

weak-lensing peak counts, can be used as a cosmological probe. However, its
relevant cosmological information is still unclear. We study the relationship
between the peak counts and other statistics in weak lensing field by using
1000 ray-tracing simulations. We construct a local transformation of lensing
field $\cal K$ to a new Gaussian field $y$, named local-Gaussianized
transformation. We calibrate the transformation with numerical simulations so
that the one-point distribution and the power spectrum of $\cal K$ can be
reproduced from a single Gaussian field $y$ and monotonic relation between $y$
and $\cal K$. Therefore, the correct information of two-point clustering and
any order of moments in weak lensing field should be preserved under
local-Gaussianized transformation. We then examine if local-Gaussianized
transformation can predict weak-lensing peak counts in simulations. The
local-Gaussianized transformation is insufficient to explain weak-lensing peak
counts in the absence of shape noise. The prediction by local-Gaussianized
transformation underestimates the simulated peak counts with a level of
$\sim20-30\%$ over a wide range of peak heights. Local-Gaussianized
transformation can predict the weak-lensing peak counts with a $\sim10\%$
accuracy in the presence of shape noise. Our analyses suggest that the
cosmological information beyond power spectrum and its moments would be
necessary to predict the weak-lensing peak counts with a percent-level
accuracy, which is an expected statistical uncertainty in upcoming wide-field
galaxy surveys.

the question of the role of the dust particle porosity on light polarization

answer this question, we developed an algorithm to generate solid particles of
arbitrary values of porosity. In brief, the model considers a given homogeneous
structure made of touching dipoles. The dipoles are randomly removed one by
one, such that the remaining structure remains connected. We stop the removal
process when the desired poros- ity is obtained. Then we study the optical
properties of the porous particle. That way, we show how the proper value of
the porosity affects the polarization and color of the light scattered by these

considers two learning algorithms in terms of how they acquire demonstrations.
""Human-Centric"" (HC) sampling is the standard supervised learning algorithm,
where a human supervisor demonstrates the task by teleoperating the robot to
provide trajectories consisting of state-control pairs. ""Robot-Centric"" (RC)
sampling is an increasingly popular alternative used in algorithms such as
DAgger, where a human supervisor observes the robot executing a learned policy
and provides corrective control labels for each state visited. RC sampling can
be challenging for human supervisors and prone to mislabeling. RC sampling can
also induce error in policy performance because it repeatedly visits areas of
the state space that are harder to learn. Although policies learned with RC
sampling can be superior to HC sampling for standard learning models such as
linear SVMs, policies learned with HC sampling may be comparable with
highly-expressive learning models such as deep learning and hyper-parametric
decision trees, which have little model error. We compare HC and RC using a
grid world and a physical robot singulation task, where in the latter the input
is a binary image of a connected set of objects on a planar worksurface and the
policy generates a motion of the gripper to separate one object from the rest.
We observe in simulation that for linear SVMs, policies learned with RC
outperformed those learned with HC but that with deep models this advantage
disappears. We also find that with RC, the corrective control labels provided
by humans can be highly inconsistent. We prove there exists a class of examples
where in the limit, HC is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy while RC
may fail to converge.

detectable up to very high redshifts, therefore can be used to study the
expansion rate of the Universe and to investigate the observational properties
of dark energy, provided that empirical correlations between spectral and
intensity properties are appropriately calibrated. We used the type Ia
supernova luminosity distances to calibrate the correlation between the peak
photon energy, $E_{p, i}$, and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy, $
E_{iso}$ in GRBs. With this correlation, we tested the reliability of applying
GRBs to measure cosmological parameters and to obtain indications on the basic
properties and evolution of dark energy. Using 162 GRBs with measured redshifts
and spectra, we applied a local regression technique to calibrate the $E_{p,
i}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation against the type Ia SN data to build a calibrated GRB
Hubble diagram. We tested the possible redshift dependence of the correlation
and its effect on the Hubble diagram. Finally, we used the GRB Hubble diagram
to investigate the dark energy EOS. For this, we focused on the so-called
Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy EOS and
implemented the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to efficiently sample
the space of cosmological parameters. Our analysis shows once more that the
$E_{p, i}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation has no significant redshift dependence.
Therefore the high-redshift GRBs can be used as a cosmological tool to
determine the basic cosmological parameters and to test different models of
dark energy in the redshift region ($z\geqslant 3$), which is unexplored by the
SNIa and baryonic acoustic oscillations data. Our updated calibrated Hubble
diagram of GRBs provides some marginal indication (at $1\sigma$ level) of an
evolving dark energy EOS.

with multiple users adopting different signal modulations, referred to as
rate-diverse NCMA. A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of
physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost
throughput of multipacket reception systems. In previous NCMA systems, users
adopt the same modulation regardless of their individual channel conditions.
This leads to suboptimal throughput for many practical scenarios, especially
when different users have widely varying channel conditions. A rate-diverse
NCMA system allows different users to use modulations that are commensurate
with their channel conditions. A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping
and decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different
modulations. While there have been past work on non-channel-coded rate-diverse
PNC, this paper is the first attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC
to ensure the reliability of the overall NCMA system. Specifically, we put
forth a symbol-splitting channel coding and modulation design so that PNC/NCMA
can work over different modulations. We implemented our rate-diverse NCMA
system on software-defined radios. Experimental results show that the
throughput of rate-diverse NCMA can outperform the state-of-the-art
rate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall, the introduction of rate diversity
significantly boosts the NCMA system throughput in practical scenarios.

submarine hydrothermal deposits on Earth. It has been frequently suggested to
have played an important role in the prebiotic chemistry due to its prominent
photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, the need for {\lambda} < 344 nm UV
radiation, which accounts for a very minor part of the energy range of the
incoming solar spectrum, limits the application of this semiconductor. In this
paper we employed a simple co-precipitation method for the fabrication of Fe,
Ni, and Cu-doped ZnS colloids and investigated their activities in the
photocatalyzed reduction of fumaric acid. The results show that the
photocatalytic activity of pristine ZnS is almost identical with that of 0.1
atom% Fe-doped ZnS, but decreases by doping 0.1 atom% Ni. However, it can be
significantly enhanced by doping Cu because this dopant makes the optical
absorption edges of ZnS shift from UV band to longer wavelengths. The optimal
doping concentration was found to be 0.3 atom%. Even under {\lambda} > 450 nm
light irradiation, the photocatalyst Zn1-xCuxS can drive the reduction of
fumaric acid to produce succinic acid. Given the existence of this doped
semiconductor in the hydrothermal vents on early Earth and its capability to
utilize both UV and visible light, ZnS might have participated more efficiently
than ever estimated in the prebiotic chemical evolution.

  surface sensitivity",,,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intense, single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses offer a promising approach for
understanding and controlling the properties of a material on an ultrafast time
scale. In particular, resonantly exciting phonons leads to a better
understanding of how they couple to other degrees of freedom in the material
(e.g., ferroelectricity, conductivity and magnetism) while enabling coherent
control of lattice vibrations and the symmetry changes associated with them.
However, an ultrafast method for observing the resulting structural changes at
the atomic scale is essential for studying phonon dynamics. A simple approach
for doing this is optical second harmonic generation (SHG), a technique with
remarkable sensitivity to crystalline symmetry in the bulk of a material as
well as at surfaces and interfaces. This makes SHG an ideal method for probing
phonon dynamics in topological insulators (TI), materials with unique surface
transport properties. Here, we resonantly excite a polar phonon mode in the
canonical TI Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with intense THz pulses and probe the subsequent
response with SHG. This enables us to separate the photoinduced lattice
dynamics at the surface from transient inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk.
Furthermore, we coherently control the phonon oscillations by varying the time
delay between a pair of driving THz pulses. Our work thus demonstrates a
versatile, table-top tool for probing and controlling ultrafast phonon dynamics
in materials, particularly at surfaces and interfaces, such as that between a
TI and a magnetic material, where exotic new states of matter are predicted to
exist.

evaporation, and characteristic variability formation time are proposed. It has
been found that the variability suppression frequency does not change when the
system passes from the quiescent state to the outburst one, suggesting that the

  Method for Semidefinite Programming with Multiple Solutions",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving large scale convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problems has long
been a challenging task numerically. Fortunately, several powerful solvers
including SDPNAL, SDPNAL+ and QSDPNAL have recently been developed to solve
linear and convex quadratic SDP problems to high accuracy successfully. These
solvers are based on the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) applied to the dual
problems with the subproblems being solved by semismooth Newton-CG methods.
Noticeably, thanks to Rockafellar's general theory on the proximal point
algorithms, the primal iteration sequence generated by the ALM enjoys an
asymptotic Q-superlinear convergence rate under a second order sufficient
condition {for the primal problem}. This second order sufficient condition
implies that the primal problem has a unique solution, which can be restrictive
in many applications. For gaining more insightful interpretations on the high
efficiency of these solvers, in this paper we conduct an asymptotic superlinear
convergence analysis of the ALM for convex SDP when the primal problem has
multiple solutions (can be unbounded). Under a fairly mild second order growth
condition, we prove that the primal iteration sequence generated by the ALM
converges asymptotically Q-superlinearly, while the dual feasibility and the
dual objective function value converge asymptotically R-superlinearly.
Moreover, by studying the metric subregularity of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
solution mapping, we also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the
asymptotic R-superlinear convergence of the dual iterate.

supported by a much larger fraction of an active surface area than known cases
of short-period comets; it may be relevant to the ongoing fragmentation. We
failed to detect any serendipitous pre-discovery observations of the comet in
archival data from major sky surveys, whereby we infer that 332P used to be
largely inactive, and is perhaps among the few short-period comets which have
been reactivated from weakly active or dormant states. We therefore constrain
an upper limit to the nucleus size as $2.0 \pm 0.2$ km in radius. A search for
small bodies in similar orbits to that of 332P reveals comet P/2010 B2 (WISE)
as the best candidate. From an empirical generalised Jupiter-family (Encke-type

alignment of the 332P--P/2010 B2 pair to be 1 in 33, a small number indicative

group on either side. They are detected almost everywhere in the ISM, as well
as in comets. In the past, they have been used to constrain the age of some
molecular clouds, since their abundance is predicted to be a strong function of
time. We present an extensive study of the cyanopolyynes distribution in the
solar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422 based on TIMASSS IRAM-30m observations. The
goals are (i) to obtain a census of the cyanopolyynes in this source and of
their isotopologues; (ii) to derive how their abundance varies across the
protostar envelope; and (iii) to obtain constraints on the history of
IRAS16293-2422. We detect several lines from HC3N and HC5N, and report the
first detection of DC3N, in a solar-type protostar. We found that the HC3N
abundance is roughly constant (~1.3x10^(-11)) in the outer cold envelope of
IRAS16293-2422, and it increases by about a factor 100 in the inner region
where Tdust>80K. The HC5N has an abundance similar to HC3N in the outer
envelope and about a factor of ten lower in the inner region. The HC3N
abundance derived in the inner region, and where the increase occurs, also
provide strong constraints on the time taken for the dust to warm up to 80K,
which has to be shorter than ~10^3-10^4yr. Finally, the cyanoacetylene
deuteration is about 50\% in the outer envelope and <5$\% in the warm inner
region. The relatively low deuteration in the warm region suggests that we are
witnessing a fossil of the HC3N abundantly formed in the tenuous phase of the
pre-collapse and then frozen into the grain mantles at a later phase. The
accurate analysis of the cyanopolyynes in IRAS16293-2422 unveils an important
part of its past story. It tells us that IRAS16293-2422 underwent a relatively
fast (<10^5yr) collapse and a very fast (<10^3-10^4yr) warming up of the cold

that enforces privacy protection according to people's privacy preferences. The
framework provides people with fine-grained visual privacy protection using: i)
personal privacy profiles, with which people can define their context-dependent
privacy preferences; and ii) visual indicators: face features, for devices to
automatically locate individuals who request privacy protection; and iii) hand
gestures, for people to flexibly interact with cameras to temporarily change
their privacy preferences. We design and implement the framework consisting of
the client app on Android devices and the cloud server. Our evaluation results
confirm this framework is practical and effective with 86% overall accuracy,
showing promising future for context-aware visual privacy protection from
pervasive cameras.

continuous-time Markov process describing the evolution of a collection of
blocks. Any two blocks of sizes $x$ and $y$ merge at rate $xy$, and any block
of size $x$ is deleted with rate $\lambda x$ (where $\lambda\geq 0$ is a fixed
parameter). This process arises for example in connection with a variety of
random-graph models which exhibit self-organised criticality. We focus on
results describing states of the process in terms of collections of excursion
lengths of random functions. For the case $\lambda=0$ (the coalescent without
deletion) we revisit and generalise previous works by authors including Aldous,
Limic, Armendariz, Uribe Bravo, and Broutin and Marckert, in which the
coalescence is related to a ""tilt"" of a random function, which increases with
time; for $\lambda>0$ we find a novel representation in which this tilt is
complemented by a ""shift"" mechanism which produces the deletion of blocks. We
describe and illustrate other representations which, like the tilt-and-shift
representation, are ""rigid"", in the sense that the coalescent process is
constructed as a projection of some process which has all of its randomness in
its initial state. We explain some applications of these constructions to
models including mean-field forest-fire and frozen-percolation processes.

used with Total Variation (TV) regularization for tomographic reconstructions.
Local TV methods fail to preserve texture details and often create additional
artefacts due to over-smoothing. Non-Local TV (NLTV) methods have been proposed
as a solution to this but they either lack continuous updates due to
computational constraints or limit the locality to a small region. In this
paper, we propose Adaptive Graph-based TV (AGTV). The proposed method goes
beyond spatial similarity between different regions of an image being
reconstructed by establishing a connection between similar regions in the
entire image regardless of spatial distance. As compared to NLTV the proposed
method is computationally efficient and involves updating the graph prior
during every iteration making the connection between similar regions stronger.
Moreover, it promotes sparsity in the wavelet and graph gradient domains. Since
TV is a special case of graph TV the proposed method can also be seen as a
generalization of SER and TV methods.

dichalcogenide (TMD) ReS$_2$ are direct band gap semiconductors, which would
make this material an ideal candidate, among all TMDs, for the realization of
efficient opto-electronic devices. The situation is however unclear, because
even more recently an indirect transition in the photoluminescence spectra of
this material has been detected, whose energy is smaller than the supposed
direct gap. To address this issue we exploit the properties of ionic liquid
gated field-effect transistors (FETs) to investigate the gap structure of bulk
ReS$_2$. Using these devices, whose high quality is demonstrated by a record
high electron FET mobility of 1,100 cm$^2$/Vs at 4K, we can induce hole
transport at the surface of the material and determine quantitatively the
smallest band gap present in the material, irrespective of its direct or
indirect nature. The value of the band gap is found to be 1.41 eV, smaller than
the 1.5 eV direct optical transition but in good agreement with the energy of
the indirect optical transition, providing an independent confirmation that
bulk ReS$_2$ is an indirect band gap semiconductor. Nevertheless, contrary to
the case of more commonly studied semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,
etc.) in their bulk form, we also find that ReS$_2$ FETs fabricated on bulk
crystals do exhibit electroluminescence when driven in the ambipolar injection
regime, likely because the difference between the direct and indirect gap is
only 100 meV. We conclude that ReS$_2$ does deserve more in-depth
investigations in relation to possible opto-electronic applications.

planned to collect a multi-meter boulder from a near-Earth asteroid (NEA), and
to bring it to the cis-lunar space in the mid-2020's for future study and
exploitation by a crewed mission. The MarcoPolo-M5 project is being proposed in
2016 for the M5 mission opportunity by ESA, to bring back to Earth a sample
from a very primitive D-type NEA.
  We aim to further characterize the physical properties of two optimal targets
for sample return space missions, the low-DeltaV NEAs (341843) 2008 EV5 and
(52381) 1993 HA. 2008 EV5 is the baseline target of ARM, but only one spectrum
of this object exists in the literature. 1993 HA is a very favourable target
for a space mission based on its dynamical properties: here we intend to assess
if it is a suitable target for MarcoPolo-M5.
  We obtained visible spectroscopy of 2008 EV5 with the FORS2 instrument at
ESO-VLT, at different rotational phases. We also obtained visible and
near-infrared spectroscopy of 1993 HA, using the EFOSC2 and SOfI instruments at
ESO-NTT. Visible photometry of 1993 HA was carried out within the IMPACTON
project at the Observatorio Astronomico do Sertao de Itaparica (Brazil).
  Our new observations are in agreement with the C-type classification of 2008
EV5. We obtained five visible spectra which do not show any variability within
the limits of noise, suggesting a homogeneous surface. We obtained the first
ever spectroscopic dataset for 1993 HA, finding a featureless, red-sloped
behaviour typical of D-types. We found that the synodic rotation period of 1993
HA is 4.107+-0.002 h. The derived lightcurve also suggests an elongated shape
(axis ratio a/b>=1.71). At this stage 1993 HA does indeed seem to be the most
favourable target for MarcoPolo-M5, though future observations are necessary to
study it further.

non-unitary but can be stable. It is hence of considerable interest to examine
the adiabatic following dynamics in periodically driven non-Hermitian systems.
We show in this work the possibility of piecewise adiabatic following
interrupted by hopping between instantaneous system eigenstates. This
phenomenon is first observed in a computational model and then theoretically
explained, using an exactly solvable model, in terms of the Stokes phenomenon.
In the latter case, the piecewise adiabatic following is shown to be a genuine
critical behavior and the precise phase boundary in the parameter space is
located. Interestingly, the critical boundary for piecewise adiabatic following
is found to be unrelated to the domain for exceptional points. To characterize
the adiabatic following dynamics, we also advocate a simple definition of the
Aharonov-Anandan (AA) phase for non-unitary cyclic dynamics, which always
yields real AA phases. In the slow driving limit, the AA phase reduces to the
Berry phase if adiabatic following persists throughout the driving without
hopping, but oscillates violently and does not approach any limit in cases of
piecewise adiabatic following. This work exposes the rich features of
non-unitary dynamics in cases of slow cycling and should stimulate future
applications of non-unitary dynamics.

budgeted version of several well known optimization problems, and when the

ensure the payments of the mechanism do not exceed the budget. Budget
feasibility introduces more challenges in mechanism design, and we study
instantiations of this problem for certain classes of submodular and XOS
valuation functions. We first obtain mechanisms with an improved approximation
ratio for weighted coverage valuations, a special class of submodular functions

transitional disk RX J1615.3-3255, located in the ~1 Myr old Lupus association.
From a polarized intensity image, taken with the HiCIAO instrument of the
Subaru Telescope, we deduce the position angle and the inclination angle of the
disk. The disk is found to extend out to 68 $\pm$ 12 AU in scattered light and
no clear structure is observed. Our inner working angle of 24 AU does not allow
us to detect a central decrease in intensity similar to that seen at 30 AU in
the 880 {\mu}m continuum observations. We compare the observations with
multiple disk models based on the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and submm
interferometry and find that an inner rim of the outer disk at 30 AU containing
small silicate grains produces a polarized intensity signal which is an order
of magnitude larger than observed. We show that a model in which the small dust
grains extend smoothly into the cavity found for large grains is closer to the
actual H-band observations. A comparison of models with different dust size
distributions suggests that the dust in the disk might have undergone
significant processing compared to the interstellar medium.

are limited since the persistence length ($l_{\text{p}} \propto \kappa$) cannot
be tuned. Here, we experimentally characterize this parameter for the first

tunable DNA nanotubes. This material enabled the validation of characteristics
inherent to semiflexible polymers and networks thereof, i.e., persistence
length, inextensibility, reptation and mesh size scaling. While the scaling of
the elastic plateau modulus with concentration $G_0 \propto c^{7/5}$ is
consistent with previous measurements and established theories, the emerging
persistence length scaling $G_0 \propto l_{\text{p}}$ opposes predominant

is obtained by expressing the mean density as a simple functional form, and
deriving the local density by differentiation. The function involves four shape
parameters, with only two or three free: a concentration parameter $c$, inner
and outer asymptotic slopes $\alpha$ and $\bar{\gamma}$, and a middle shape
parameter $\beta$. Analytic expressions for the potential and velocity
dispersion exist for $\bar{\gamma}=3$ and for $\beta$ a natural number. We
match the models to the DM haloes in cosmological simulations, with and without

with three free parameters ($c$, $\alpha$, $\bar{\gamma}$) and $\beta=2$. For
an analytic potential, similar fits are obtained for $\bar{\gamma}=3$ and
$\beta=2$ with only two free parameters ($c$, $\alpha$); this is our favorite
model. A linear combination of two such profiles, with an additional free
concentration parameter, provides excellent fits also for $\beta=1$, where the
expressions are simpler. The fit quality is comparable to non-analytic popular
models. An analytic potential is useful for modeling the inner-halo evolution
due to gas inflows and outflows, studying environmental effects on the outer
halo, and generating halo potentials or initial conditions for simulations. The
analytic velocity can quantify simulated and observed rotation curves without

local galaxies but their formation and evolution remain elusive. They may hold
crucial information for our understanding of many key issues (i.e., census of
baryonic and dark matter, star formation in the low density regime, mass
function). The most massive examples - the so called giant LSBGs - can be as
massive as the Milky Way, but with this mass being distributed in a much larger
disk. Malin 1 is an iconic giant LSBG, perhaps the largest disk galaxy known.
We attempt to bring new insights on its structure and evolution on the basis of
new images covering a wide range in wavelength. We have computed surface
brightness profiles (and average surface brightnesses in 16 regions of
interest), in six photometric bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, i, z). We compared these
data to various models, testing a variety of assumptions concerning the
formation and evolution of Malin 1. We find that the surface brightness and
color profiles can be reproduced by a long and quiet star-formation history due
to the low surface density; no significant event, such as a collision, is
necessary. Such quiet star formation across the giant disk is obtained in a
disk model calibrated for the Milky Way, but with an angular momentum
approximately 20 times larger. Signs of small variations of the star-formation
history are indicated by the diversity of ages found when different regions
within the galaxy are intercompared.For the first time, panchromatic images of
Malin 1 are used to constrain the stellar populations and the history of this
iconic example among giant LSBGs. Based on our model, the extreme disk of Malin
1 is found to have a long history of relatively low star formation (about 2
Msun/yr). Our model allows us to make predictions on its stellar mass and
metallicity.

state is obtained from a new parametrization of the FSU2 relativistic
mean-field functional that satisfies these latest astrophysical constraints
and, at the same time, reproduces the properties of nuclear matter and finite
nuclei while fulfilling the restrictions on high-density matter deduced from
heavy-ion collisions. On the one hand, the equation of state of neutron star
matter is softened around saturation density, which increases the compactness
of canonical neutron stars leading to stellar radii below 13 km. On the other
hand, the equation of state is stiff enough at higher densities to fulfill the
2$M_{\odot}$ limit. By a slight modification of the parametrization, we also
find that the constraints of 2$M_{\odot}$ neutron stars with radii around 13 km
are satisfied when hyperons are considered. The inclusion of the high magnetic
fields present in magnetars further stiffens the equation of state. Hyperonic
magnetars with magnetic fields in the surface of $ \sim 10^{15}$ G and with

Scalable registers of spin qubits are essential to the progress of QIP. Ion
implantation is the only known technique able to produce defect pairs close
enough to allow spin coupling via dipolar interaction. Although several
competing methods have been proposed to increase the resulting resolution of
ion implantation, the reliable creation of working registers is still to be
demonstrated. The current limitation are residual radiation-induced defects,
resulting in degraded qubit performance as trade-off for positioning accuracy.
Here we present an optimized estimation of nanomask implantation parameters

$\gamma$-decay branching ratios have been precisely measured. Three additional,
tentative resonances at 71, 105 and 215 keV proton beam energy, respectively,
were not observed here. For the strengths of these resonances, experimental
upper limits have been derived that are significantly more stringent than the
upper limits reported in the literature. Conclusions: Based on the present
experimental data and also previous literature data, an updated thermonuclear
reaction rate is provided in tabular and parametric form. The new reaction rate
is significantly higher than previous evaluations at temperatures of 0.08-0.3

which is not a forest of stars and paths of length $3$, and fixed number of
colours $r\ge 2$ there exist positive constants $c, C$ such that for $p \leq
cn^{-1/m_2(F)}$ the probability that every colouring of the edges of the random
graph $G(n,p)$ contains a monochromatic copy of $F$ is $o(1)$ (the
""0-statement""), while for $p \geq Cn^{-1/m_2(F)}$ it is $1-o(1)$ (the
""1-statement""). Here $m_2(F)$ denotes the $2$-density of $F$. On the other
hand, the case where $F$ is a forest of stars has a coarse threshold which is
determined by the appearance of a certain small subgraph in $G(n, p)$.
  Recently, the natural extension of the 1-statement of this theorem to
$k$-uniform hypergraphs was proved by Conlon and Gowers and, independently, by
Friedgut, R\""odl and Schacht. In particular, they showed an upper bound of
order $n^{-1/m_k(F)}$ for the $1$-statement, where $m_k(F)$ denotes the
$k$-density of $F$. Similarly as in the graph case, it is known that the
threshold for star-like hypergraphs is given by the appearance of small
subgraphs. In this paper we show that another type of thresholds exists if $k
\ge 4:$ there are $k$-uniform hypergraphs for which the threshold is determined
by the asymmetric Ramsey problem in which a different hypergraph has to be
avoided in each colour-class.
  Along the way we obtain a general bound on the $1$-statement for asymmetric
Ramsey properties in random hypergraphs. This extends the work of Kohayakawa
and Kreuter, and of Kohayakawa, Schacht and Sp\""ohel who showed a similar
result in the graph case. We prove the corresponding 0-statement for
hypergraphs satisfying certain balancedness conditions.

diagram of the BHM in a magnetic field. Then, we introduce an effective
Hamiltonian describing excess particles on a MI and calculate the vortex
density, momentum distribution and the energy gap. These calculations indicate
that the vortex solid forms for small NN repulsions, but a homogeneous
featureless `Bose-metal' takes the place of it as the NN repulsion increases.
We consider particular filling factors at which the bosonic FQH state is
expected to form. Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory to the excess particle is
introduced, and a modified Gutzwiller wave function, which describes bosons
with attached flux quanta, is introduced. The energy of the excess particles in
the bosonic FQH state is calculated using that wave function, and it is
compared with the energy of the vortex solid and Bose-metal. We found that the
energy of the bosonic FQH state is lower than that of the Bose-metal and
comparable with the vortex solid. Finally, we clarify the condition that the
composite fermion appears by using CS theory on the lattice that we previously
proposed for studying the electron FQH effect.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). These are often interpreted as
Lense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, a relativistic effect
whereby the spin of the BH distorts the surrounding space-time, inducing nodal
precession. The best evidence for the precession model is the recent discovery,
using a long joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation of H 1743-322, that the
centroid energy of the iron fluorescence line changes systematically with QPO
phase. This was interpreted as the inner flow illuminating different azimuths
of the accretion disc as it precesses, giving rise to a blue/red shifted iron
line when the approaching/receding disc material is illuminated. Here, we
develop a physical model for this interpretation, including a self-consistent
reflection continuum, and fit this to the same H 1743-322 data. We use an
analytic function to parameterise the asymmetric illumination pattern on the
disc surface that would result from inner flow precession, and find that the
data are well described if two bright patches rotate about the disc surface.
This model is preferred to alternatives considering an oscillating disc
ionisation parameter, disc inner radius and radial emissivity profile. We find
that the reflection fraction varies with QPO phase (3.5 sigma), adding to the
now formidable body of evidence that Type-C QPOs are a geometric effect. This
is the first example of tomographic QPO modelling, initiating a powerful new
technique that utilizes QPOs in order to map the dynamics of accreting material
close to the BH.

regression with a scalar response and a functional covariate. This central
problem of functional data analysis is well known to be ill-posed, thus
requiring a regularised estimation procedure. The two most commonly used
approaches are based on spectral truncation or Tikhonov regularisation of the
empirical covariance operator. In principle, Tikhonov regularisation is the
more canonical choice. Compared to spectral truncation, it is robust to
eigenvalue ties, while it attains the optimal minimax rate of convergence in
the mean squared sense, and not just in a concentration probability sense. In
this paper, we show that, surprisingly, one can strictly improve upon the
performance of the Tikhonov estimator in finite samples by means of a linear
estimator, while retaining its stability and asymptotic properties by combining
it with a form of spectral truncation. Specifically, we construct an estimator
that additively decomposes the functional covariate by projecting it onto two
orthogonal subspaces defined via functional PCA; it then applies Tikhonov
regularisation to the one component, while leaving the other component
unregularised. We prove that when the covariate is Gaussian, this hybrid
estimator uniformly improves upon the MSE of the Tikhonov estimator in a
non-asymptotic sense, effectively rendering it inadmissible. This domination is
shown to also persist under discrete observation of the covariate function. The
hybrid estimator is linear, straightforward to construct in practice, and with
no computational overhead relative to the standard regularisation methods. By
means of simulation, it is shown to furnish sizeable gains even for modest
sample sizes.

  The control is based on stochastic switching of refrigerators depending on

modify the control design to account for refrigerator door openings.
  Extensive simulations with actual frequency signal data and with different

that the proposed controller outperforms a relevant state-of-the-art

they correct the beam-induced leakage from temperature to polarization. The
methods are applicable to a case where part of the sky has been masked out to
remove foreground contamination, leaving a pure CMB signal, but incomplete sky
coverage. The first method (DQML) is derived as the optimal quadratic

interesting for studies of electron-hole hybridization and interaction effects

used eight-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ theory together with the envelope function
approximation to calculate the band structure of such nanowires. For a fixed
core radius, as a function of shell thickness the band structure changes from
metallic (for a thick shell) to semiconducting (for a thin shell) with a gap
induced by quantum confinement. For intermediate shell thickness, a different
gapped band structure can appear, where the gap is induced by hybridization
between the valence band in GaSb and the conduction band in InAs. To establish
a relationship between the nanowire band structures and signatures in
thermoelectrical measurements, we use the calculated energy dispersions as
input to the Boltzmann equation and to ballistic transport equations to study
the diffusive limit and the ballistic limit, respectively. Our theoretical
results provide a guide for experiments, showing how thermoelectric
measurements in a gated setup can be used to distinguish between different

Their final evolutionary stages are characterized by a poorly populated

to assess the real physical nature of the OCR candidate NGC 7193. GMOS/Gemini
spectroscopy of 53 stars in the inner target region were obtained to derive
radial velocities and atmospheric parameters. We also employed photometric and
proper motion data. The analysis method consists of the following steps: (i)
analysis of the statistical resemblance between the cluster and a set of field
samples with respect to the sequences defined in colour-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs); (ii) a 5-dimensional iteractive exclusion routine was employed to
identify outliers from kinematical and positional data; (iii) isochrone fitting
to the $K_{s}\times(J-K_{s})$ CMD of the remaining stars and the dispersion of
spectral types along empirical sequences in the $(J-H)\times(H-K_{s})$ diagram
was checked. A group of stars was identified for which the mean heliocentric
distance is compatible with that obtained via isochrone fitting and whose
metallicities are compatible with each other. Fifteen member stars observed
spectroscopically were identified together with other 19 probable members. Our
results indicate that NGC 7193 is a genuine OCR, of an once very populous OC,

Competition influences individual demographics, affecting population size,
which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We consider a stochastic
individual-based pure jump process taking values in the space of point
measures, and whose jump events describe the individual reproduction, transfer
and death mechanisms. In a large population scale, the stochastic process is
proved to converge to the solution of a nonlinear integro-differential
equation. When there are only two different traits and no mutation, this
equation reduces to a non-standard two-dimensional dynamical system. We show
how crucial the forms of the transfer rates are for the long-term behavior of
its solutions. We describe the dynamics of invasion and fixation when one of
the two traits is initially rare, and compute the invasion probabilities. Then,
we study the process under the assumption of rare mutations. We prove that the
stochastic process at the mutation time scale converges to a jump process which
describes the successive invasions of successful mutants. We show that the
horizontal transfer can have a major impact on the distribution of the
successive mutational fixations, leading to dramatically different behaviors,
from expected evolution scenarios to evolutionary suicide. Simulations are

leading to an effective period doubling of the system and a new optical band

effects but a redshift determination typically needs optical and infrared
follow-up to then infer X-ray temperatures and luminosities. Aims. We want to
confirm serendipitously discovered X-ray emitting cluster candidates and
measure their cosmological redshift through the analysis and exploration of
multi-wavelength photometric catalogues. Methods. We developed a tool, the
Integrated Cluster Finder (ICF), to search for clusters by determining
overdensities of potential member galaxies in optical and infrared catalogues.
Based on a spectroscopic meta-catalogue we calibrated colour-redshift relations
that combine optical (SDSS) and IR data (UKIDSS, WISE). The tool is used to
quantify the overdensity of galaxies against the background via a modified
redMaPPer technique and to quantify the confidence of a cluster detection.
Results. Cluster finding results are compared to reference catalogues found in
the literature. The results agree to within 95-98%. The tool is used to confirm
488 out of 830 cluster candidates drawn from 3XMMe in the footprint of the SDSS
and CFHT catalogues. Conclusions. The ICF is a flexible and highly efficient
tool to search for galaxy clusters in multiple catalogues and is freely
available to the community. It may be used to identify the cluster content in
future X-ray catalogues from XMM-Newton and eventually from eROSITA.

activity of the Sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs,
within the maximum-to-minimum temporal variations of the 11-year solar activity
cycle. Furthermore, we report on the discovery of temporal variability in the
acoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC10644253 with a

short-period modulation, or quasi-biennal oscillation, of its magnetic activity
as observed in the Sun and in the 1-Gyr-old solar analog HD30495. In addition,
the lithium abundance and the chromospheric activity estimated from HERMES

diatomic molecules is of key importance to interpret the experiments in the
search for violation of time-reversal (T) and spatial-parity (P) symmetries of
fundamental interactions it terms of the electron electric dipole moment, eEDM,
and dimensionless constant, $k_{T,P}$, characterizing the strength of the
T,P-odd pseudoscalar$-$scalar electron$-$nucleus neutral current interaction.
ACME collaboration has recently obtained and improved limits on these
quantities using a beam of ThO molecules in the $H^3\Delta_1$ state [Science
343, 269 (2014)]. We apply the combined direct 4-component and two-step
relativistic pseudopotential/restoration approaches to a benchmark calculation
of the effective electric field, Eeff, parameter of the T,P-odd
pseudoscalar$-$scalar interaction, $W_{T,P}$, and HFS constant in $^3\Delta_1$
state of the ThO molecule. The first two parameters are required to interpret
the experimental data in terms of the eEDM and $k_{T,P}$ constant. We have
investigated the electron correlation for all of the 98 electrons of ThO
simultaneously up to the level of the coupled cluster with single, double and
noniterative triple amplitudes theory. Contributions from iterative triple and
noniterative quadruple cluster amplitudes for the valence electrons have been
also treated. The obtained values are Eeff=79.9 GV/cm, $W_{T,P}$=113.1 kHz. The
theoretical uncertainty of these values we estimate as about two times smaller
than that of our previous study [JCP, 142, 024301 (2015)]. It was found that
the correlation of the inner- and outer- core electrons contributes 9% to the
effective electric field. The values of the molecule frame dipole moment of the
$^3\Delta_1$ state and the $H^3\Delta_1\to X^1\Sigma^+$ transition energy of
ThO calculated within the same methods are in a very good agreement with the
experiment.

communication, sensing and low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. However, such
micro-lasers exhibit negligible absorption of free-space broadband pump light.
Recently, this limitation was lifted by cascade energy transfer, in which the
absorption and quality factor are modulated with wavelength, enabling
non-resonant pumping of high-quality micro-lasers and solar-pumped laser to
operate at record low solar concentration. Here, we present a generic
theoretical framework for modeling the absorption, emission and energy transfer
of incoherent radiation between cascade sensitizer and laser gain media. Our
model is based on linear equations of the modified net radiation method and is
therefore robust, fast converging and has low complexity. We apply this
formalism to compute the optimal parameters of low-threshold solar-pumped
lasers. It is revealed that the interplay between the absorption and
self-absorption of such lasers defines the optimal pump absorption below the
maximal value, which is in contrast to conventional lasers for which full pump
absorption is desired. Numerical results are compared to experimental data on a
sensitized Nd:YAG cavity, and quantitative agreement with theoretical models is
found. Our work modularizes the gain and sensitizing components and paves the
way for the optimal design of broadband-pumped high-quality micro-lasers and
efficient solar-pumped lasers.

  Proving opacity is complicated because it allows concurrent transactions to
observe distinct memory states, while TM implementations are typically based on
one single shared store. This paper presents a sound and complete method, based
on coarse-grained abstraction, for reducing proofs of opacity to the relatively
simpler correctness condition: linearizability. We use our methods to verify
TML and NORec from the literature and show our techniques extend to relaxed
memory models by showing that both are opaque under TSO without requiring
additional fences. Our methods also elucidate TM designs at higher level of

The barrier for the hydrogenation reaction is almost independent of the binding
energy, though. We calculated tunneling rate constants of H + HNCO
$\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CO at temperatures down to 103 K combining QM/MM with
instanton theory. Tunneling dominates the reaction at such low temperatures.
The tunneling reaction is hardly accelerated by the amorphous solid water
surface compared to the gas phase for this system, even though the activation
energy of the surface reaction is lower than the one of the gas-phase reaction.
Both the height and width of the barrier affect the tunneling rate in practice.
Strong kinetic isotope effects were observed by comparing to rate constants of
D + HNCO $\rightarrow$ NHDCO. At 103 K we found a KIE of 231 on the surface and
146 in the gas phase. Furthermore, we investigated the gas-phase reaction

breast dose distributions with adaptive filtration. Adaptive filtration reduces
detector dynamic range and improves image quality. The adaptive filter with
predetermined shape is placed at the x-ray beam such that the x-ray intensity
at the detector surface is flat. However, adaptive filter alters the mean dose
to the breast, as well as volume distribution of the dose. Methods: The dose
was measured using a 14 cm diameter cylindrical acrylic breast phantom. An
acrylic adaptive filter was fabricated to match the 14 cm diameter of the
phantom. The dose was measured using ion chamber inserted into holes
distributed along the radius of the phantom from the center to the edge. The
radial distribution of dose was measured and fitted by an analytical function
and the volume distribution and mean value of dose was calculated. The
measurements were performed at 40, 60, 90, and 120 kVp tube voltages and 6.6
mGy air kerma. Results: The adaptive filter decreased mean breast dose by a
factor of 1.6-2.2 depending on the tube voltage. To maintain image quality, the
tube output was increased by these factors when adaptive filter was used. The
adaptive filter provided uniform volume distribution of dose at 40 kVp and 60
kVp tube voltages, but the distribution was non-uniform at 90 kVp and 120 kVp
tube voltages. Conclusion: While adaptive filtration helps with detector
dynamic range, CT number uniformity, and CT noise uniformity, the volume
non-uniformity of the dose with adaptive filter depends on tube voltage. On the
other hand, at the same average breast dose, volume non-uniformity of the dose
with adaptive filter was not higher that that without adaptive filter. The
results allowed also to determine necessary dose increase factor to compensate
for x-ray absorption in the adaptive filter.

anharmonic effects at the interface itself contribute a surprisingly small part
of the total thermal conductance. The larger fraction of the thermal
conductance at high temperatures arises from anharmonic effects away from the

energy density, which suggest that bulk anharmonic processes increase
interfacial conductance by thermalizing energy from modes with low transmission

has been studied in recent years. In addition to the use of higher-order
reconstruction techniques, many terms are used in the Taylor expansion of the
gas distribution functions. Therefore, a large number of coefficients need to
be determined in the calculation of the time evolution of the gas distribution
function at cell interfaces. As a consequence, the higher-order flux function
takes much more computational time than that of a second-order gas-kinetic
scheme. This paper aims to simplify the evolution model by two steps. Firstly,
the coefficients related to the higher-order spatial and temporal derivatives
of a distribution function are redefined to reduce the computational cost.
Secondly, based on the physical analysis, some terms can be removed without
loss of accuracy. Through the simplifications, the computational efficiency of
the higher-order scheme is increased significantly. In addition, a
self-adaptive numerical viscosity is designed to minimize the necessary
numerical dissipation. Several numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the
accuracy and robustness of the current scheme.

Satisfaction Problems (VCSPs) with a fixed finite constraint language {\Gamma}

is given by a finite set of variables and a sum of functions belonging to

in [0, 1] specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables, and the
goal is to find an assignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the

condition that {\Gamma} contains the equality relation, the basic LP relaxation
is optimal for constant-factor approximation for VCSP({\Gamma}) unless the
Unique Games Conjecture fails. Using the algebraic approach to the CSP, we give
new natural algebraic conditions for the finiteness of the integrality gap for
the basic LP relaxation of VCSP({\Gamma}). We also show how these algebraic
conditions can in principle be used to round solutions of the basic LP
relaxation, and how, for several examples that cover all previously known

Finally, we show that the absence of another algebraic condition leads to
NP-hardness of constant-factor approximation.

harmonic-oscillator and Coulomb potentials. In spite of the singularities of
the Coulomb and centrifugal potentials, accurate bound-state energies are
obtained for all partial waves. The analysis of these results and a comparison
with other Lagrange-mesh calculations lead to a simple rule to predict in which

Lagrange-mesh calculations. In addition, the Lagrange-Laguerre-mesh approach is
applied to the evaluation of phase shifts via integral relations. Small numbers

holes are regions of low-density plasma on the Sun with open magnetic field
lines. As the source of the fast solar wind, the detection and characterization
of these regions is important for both testing theories of their formation and
evolution and from a space weather perspective. Coronal holes are detected in
full disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the corona obtained with the
Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The proposed
method detects coronal boundaries without determining any fixed intensity value
in the data. Instead, the active contour segmentation employs an
energy-minimization in which coronal holes are assumed to have more homogeneous
intensities than surrounding active regions and quiet Sun. The segmented
coronal holes tend to correspond to unipolar magnetic regions, are consistent
with concurrent solar wind observations, and qualitatively match the coronal
holes segmented by other methods. The means to identify a coronal hole without
specification of a final intensity threshold may allow this algorithm to be
more robust across multiple datasets, regardless of data type, resolution, and

local spatial inversion symmetry by a trap potential within the framework of
the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory at $T=0$, we point out that an
odd-parity $p$-wave Cooper-pair amplitude is expected to have already been
realized in previous experiments on an (even-parity) $s$-wave superfluid Fermi
gas with spin imbalance. This indicates that, when one suddenly changes the
$s$-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate $p$-wave one by using a Feshbach
technique in this case, a non-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter is
immediately obtained, which is given by the product of the $p$-wave interaction
and the $p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the
spin-imbalanced $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas. Thus, by definition, the system
is in the $p$-wave superfluid state, at least just after this manipulation.
Since the achievement of a $p$-wave superfluid state is one of the most
exciting challenges in cold Fermi gas physics, our results may provide an
alternative approach to this unconventional pairing state. In addition, since
the parity-mixing effect cannot be explained as far as one deals with a trap
potential in the local density approximation (LDA), it is considered as a
crucial example which requires us to go beyond LDA.

timescale. We link this trend to the changing efficiency of conversion of HI to
H2 as galaxies increase in stellar mass surface density as they evolve.
Finally, we show that galaxies start out barely obscured and increase in
obscuration as they evolve, yet there is no clear and simple link between
obscuration and global galaxy properties.

combined ideas originating in interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model
reduction with complex Chebyshev approximation. Retaining this framework, our
approach to the MIMO problem has its principal computational cost dominated by
(sparse) linear solves, and so it can remain an effective strategy in many
large-scale settings. We are able to avoid computationally demanding
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm calculations that are normally required to monitor
progress within each optimization cycle through the use of ""data-driven""
rational approximations that are built upon previously computed function
samples. Numerical examples are included that illustrate our approach. We
produce high fidelity reduced models having consistently better
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance than models produced via balanced truncation;
these models often are as good as (and occasionally better than) models
produced using optimal Hankel norm approximation as well. In all cases

exact left-hand-cut discontinuity for an uncoupled $S$-wave partial-wave
amplitude in potential scattering for a given finite-range potential. The
results obtained from the $N/D$ method for the partial-wave amplitude are
rigorous, since now the discontinuities along the left-hand cut and right-hand
cut are exactly known. This solves the open question with respect to the $N/D$
method and the effect on the final result of the non-perturbative iterative
diagrams in the evaluation of $\Delta(A)$. A big advantage of the method is
that short-range physics (corresponding to integrated out degrees of freedom
within low-energy Effective Field Theory) does not contribute to $\Delta(A)$
and it manifests through the extra subtractions that are implemented within the
method. We show the equivalence of the $N/D$ method and the Lippmann-Schwinger
(LS) equation for a nonsingular $^1S_0$ $NN$ potential (Yukawa potential). The
equivalence between the $N/D$ method with one extra subtraction and the LS
equation renormalized with one counter term or with subtractive renormalization
also holds for the singular attractive higher-order ChPT potentials. The $N/D$
method also allows to evaluate partial-wave amplitudes with a higher number of
extra subtractions, that we fix in terms of shape parameters within the
effective range expansion. The result at NNLO shows that the $^1S_0$ phase
shifts might be accurately described once the electromagnetic and charge
symmetry breaking terms are included. Our present results can be extended to
higher partial waves as well as to coupled channel scattering.

can thus alter geophysical and geochemical characteristics of the deep Earth.
While the spin transition in ferropericlase has been vigorously established at
P ~ 60 GPa and 300 K, experimental evidence for spin transitions in other
rock-forming minerals, such as bridgmanite and post-perovskite, remains
controversial. Multiple valence, spin, and coordination states of iron in
bridgmanite and post-perovskite are difficult to resolve with conventional
spin-probing techniques. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, is sensitive
to high/low spin ferrous/ferric iron at different sites; thus, it can be a
powerful probe for spin transitions. Here we establish the optical signature of
low spin Fe3+O6, a plausible low spin unit in bridgmanite and post-perovskite,
by optical absorption experiments in diamond anvil cells. We show that the
optical absorption of Fe3+O6 in NAL (new aluminous phase) is very sensitive to
the iron spin state and represents a model behavior of bridgmanite and
post-perovskite in the deep lower mantle across a spin transition.
Specifically, an absorption band centered at ~ 19000 cm-1 is characteristic of
the 2T2g to 2T1g (2A2g) transition in low spin Fe3+ in NAL at 40 GPa. This new
spectroscopic information constrains the crystal field splitting energy of low
spin Fe3+ to ~ 22200 cm-1 which we also independently confirm by our
first-principles calculations. Together with available information on the
electronic structure of Fe3+O6-compounds, we constrain the spin-pairing energy
of Fe3+ in an octahedral field to ~ 20000-23000 cm-1. This implies that
octahedrally-coordinated Fe3+ in bridgmanite is low spin at P > ~ 40 GPa.

perturbations of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, are
locally exactly equivalent to a different FLRW solution, as long as their
wavelength is much larger than the sound horizon of all fluid components. This
fact is known as the ""separate universe"" paradigm. However, no such relation is
known for anisotropic adiabatic perturbations, which correspond to an FLRW
spacetime with large-scale tidal fields. Here, we provide a closed, fully
relativistic set of evolutionary equations for the nonlinear evolution of such
modes, based on the conformal Fermi (CFC) frame. We show explicitly that the
tidal effects are encoded by the Weyl tensor, and are hence entirely different
from an anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime, where the anisotropy is sourced by the
Ricci tensor. In order to close the system, certain higher derivative terms
have to be dropped. We show that this approximation is equivalent to the local
tidal approximation of Hui and Bertschinger (1995). We also show that this very
simple set of equations matches the exact evolution of the density field at
second order, but fails at third and higher order. This provides a useful,
easy-to-use framework for computing the fully relativistic growth of structure
at second order.

Therefore it is compatible with automation. It is based on the analysis of the
scattering pattern (scatterogram) generated by a bacterial microcolony growing
on agar, when placed in the path of a laser beam. Measurements are directly
performed on closed Petri dishes. The characteristic features of a given
scatterogram are first computed by projecting the pattern onto the Zernike
orthogonal basis. Then the obtained data are compared to a database so that
machine learning can yield identification result. A 10-fold cross-validation
was performed on a database over 8 species (15 strains, 1906 scatterograms), at

agar. That is why we propose a novel scheme capable of collecting
back-scattered light which provides comparable results.

  Affected with Motion Artifacts","14 Pages, 11 Figures, 2 Tables, 27 Equations, Journal of Ambient
  Intelligence and Humanized Computing, Oct. 2016",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wearable photoplethysmography (WPPG) has recently become a common technology
in heart rate (HR) monitoring. General observation is that the motion artifacts
change the statistics of the acquired PPG signal. Consequently, estimation of
HR from such a corrupted PPG signal is challenging. However, if an
accelerometer is also used to acquire the acceleration signal simultaneously,
it can provide helpful information that can be used to reduce the motion
artifacts in the PPG signal. By dint of repetitive movements of the subjects
hands while running, the accelerometer signal is found to be quasi-periodic.
Over short-time intervals, it can be modeled by a finite harmonic sum (HSUM).
Using the harmonic sum (HSUM) model, we obtain an estimate of the instantaneous
fundamental frequency of the accelerometer signal. Since the PPG signal is a
composite of the heart rate information (that is also quasi-periodic) and the
motion artifact, we fit a joint harmonic sum (HSUM) model to the PPG signal.
One of the harmonic sums corresponds to the heart-beat component in PPG and the
other models the motion artifact. However, the fundamental frequency of the
motion artifact has already been determined from the accelerometer signal.
Subsequently, the HR is estimated from the joint HSUM model. The mean absolute
error in HR estimates was 0.7359 beats per minute (BPM) with a standard
deviation of 0.8328 BPM for 2015 IEEE Signal Processing (SP) cup data. The
ground-truth HR was obtained from the simultaneously acquired ECG for
validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method is compared
with four methods that were recently developed and evaluated on the same
dataset.

separating the bradyonic and tachyonic realms is investigated. Making use of
the Majorana equation for particles with arbitrary spin and the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, it is proved that, under certain conditions of spatial
confinement, quantum fluctuations allow particles with very small mass and
velocity close to the speed of light to pass in the tachyonic realm, avoiding
the problem of the infinite barrier. This theoretical approach allows an
avoidance of the difficulties encountered in quantum field theory when it is
extended to particles with imaginary rest mass.

magnetic charges and currents, to discuss how different models for electric and
magnetic dipoles do or do not carry hidden momentum under the influence of
external electromagnetic fields. Based on that, we discuss how the models
adopted for the electric and magnetic dipoles from the particles that compose a
material medium influence the expression for the electromagnetic part of the
light momentum in the medium. We show that Abraham expression is compatible
with electric dipoles formed by electric charges and magnetic dipoles formed by
magnetic charges, while Minkowski expression is compatible with electric
dipoles formed by magnetic currents and magnetic dipoles formed by electric
currents. The expression $\varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$, on the
other hand, is shown to be compatible with electric dipoles formed by electric
charges and magnetic dipoles formed by electric currents, which are much more
natural models. So this expression has an interesting interpretation in the
Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium: It is the
expression compatible with the nonexistence of magnetic charges. We also
provide a simple justification of why Abraham and Minkowski momenta can be
associated with the kinetic and canonical momentum of light, respectively.

systematically, is based on a Fabry-Perot optical cavity working in a
non-degenerate four wave-mixing configuration. This particular PRO has the
property that the generated beam exhibits laser-like phase invariance and, as
an application, we show how a suitably modulated injected beam converts the
output field from phase-invariant into phase-bistable. While the emphasis is
made on the making of the experimental device and on the way measurements are
implemented, some introduction to the photorefractive effect as well as to the
necessary concepts of nonlinear dynamics are also given, so that the article is

important rare events on long timescales. When there is no delay, classical
large deviations theory quantifies rare events such as escapes from metastable
fixed points. Near such fixed points, one can approximate nonlinear delay SDEs
by linear delay SDEs. Here, we develop a fully explicit large deviations
framework for (necessarily Gaussian) processes $X_t$ driven by linear delay
SDEs with small diffusion coefficients. Our approach enables fast numerical
computation of the action functional controlling rare events for $X_t$ and of
the most likely paths transiting from $X_0 = p$ to $X_T=q$. Via linear noise
local approximations, we can then compute most likely routes of escape from
metastable states for nonlinear delay SDEs. We apply our methodology to the
detailed dynamics of a genetic regulatory circuit, namely the co-repressive
toggle switch, which may be described by a nonlinear chemical Langevin SDE with
delay.

consists of a processing device, small amount of memory, battery and radio
transceiver for communication. The sensor nodes are autonomous and spatially
distributed in an area of investigation. Certain applications and protocols of
wireless sensor networks require that the sensor nodes should be aware of their
position relative to the sensor network. For it to be significant and to be of
value, the data such as temperature, humidity and pressure, gathered by sensor
nodes must be ascribed to the relative position from where it was collected.
For this to happen, the sensor nodes must be aware of their relative positions.
Traditional location finding solutions, such as Global Positioning System, are
not feasible for wireless sensor nodes due to multiple reasons. Therefore, new
methods, techniques and algorithms need to be developed to solve the problem of
location and position estimation of wireless sensor nodes. A number of
algorithms and techniques based upon different characteristics and properties
of sensor nodes have already been proposed for this purpose. This chapter
discusses the basic principles and techniques used in the localization
algorithms, categories of these algorithms and also takes a more closer look at
a few of the representative localization schemes.
