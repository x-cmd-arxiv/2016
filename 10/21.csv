are studied. The hadron-quark model used to determine the stellar matter
equation of state favors the appearance of quark matter: the coincidence of the
deconfinement and chiral transitions and a low vacuum constituent quark mass.
These two properties are essential to build equations of state that predict
pure quark matter in the center of neutron stars. The effect of
vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector terms is discussed, and it is shown that
the vector-isoscalar terms are necessary to describe 2$M_\odot$ hybrid stars,
and the vector-isovector terms result in larger quark cores and a smaller
deconfinement density.

of astrophysical calibration targets, ensuring that all GES results on radial
velocities, atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundance ratios will be both
internally consistent and easily comparable with other literature results,
especially from other large spectroscopic surveys and from Gaia. The
calibration of GES is particularly delicate because of: (i) the large space of
parameters covered by its targets, ranging from dwarfs to giants, from O to M
stars, and with a large range of metallicities, as well as including fast
rotators, emission line objects, stars affected by veiling and so on; (ii) the
variety of observing setups, with different wavelength ranges and resolution;
and (iii) the choice of analyzing the data with many different state-of-the art
methods, each stronger in a different region of the parameter space, which
ensures a better understanding of systematic uncertainties. An overview of the
GES calibration and homogenization strategy is also given, along with some
examples of the usage and results of calibrators in GES iDR4 - the fourth

about the interior structure and composition of planets, moons, asteroids and
comets. Gravitational field modeling typically approximates the target body
with a sphere, leading to a representation in spherical harmonics. However,
small celestial bodies are often irregular in shape, and hence poorly
approximated by a sphere. A much better suited geometrical fit is achieved by a
tri-axial ellipsoid. This is also mirrored in the fact that the associated
harmonic expansion (ellipsoidal harmonics) shows a significantly better
convergence behavior as opposed to spherical harmonics. Unfortunately, complex
mathematics and numerical problems (arithmetic overflow) so far severely
limited the applicability of ellipsoidal harmonics. In this paper, we present a
method that allows expanding ellipsoidal harmonics to a considerably higher
degree compared to existing techniques. We apply this novel approach to model
the gravitational field of comet 67P, the final target of the Rosetta mission.
The comparison of results based on the ellipsoidal parameterization with those
based on the spheroidal and spherical approximations reveals that the latter is
clearly inferior; the spheroidal solution, on the other hand, is virtually just
as accurate as the ellipsoidal one. Finally, in order to generalize our
findings, we assess the gravitational field modeling performance for some 400
small bodies in the solar system. From this investigation we generally conclude
that the spheroidal representation is an attractive alternative to the complex
ellipsoidal parameterization on the one hand, and the inadequate spherical
representation on the other hand.

measurements. Such models are useful to identify informative topological

relying only on topological measurements. Remarkably, we have found a

This implies that a number of existing finite key security proofs could be
flawed and cannot guarantee security. Here, we solve this serious problem by
showing that the use of Azuma's inequality for parameter estimation makes QKD

observed in RMn$_2$O$_5$ only at low temperatures ($T\leq T_C = 30$ -- 35 K).
We believe that the polarization we observed was caused by the frozen

sufficiently high temperatures $T\gg T_C$ the frozen superparaelectric state
was destroyed, and the conventional superparaelectric state occurred. This
happened when the potential barriers of the restricted polar domain
reorientations become equal to the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons
(leakage). The hysteresis loops were measured by the so-called PUND method
which allowed us to correctly subtract the contribution of conductivity from
the measured polarization. The correlations between properties of the phase
separation domains and polarization were revealed and studied. The
high-temperature polarization also had a magnetic nature and was controlled by
the magnetic field because the double exchange between pairs of Mn ions with

and model construction within ASTRO-DF is adaptive in the sense that the extent

within ASTRO-DF. Such balancing of errors is designed to ensure that Monte
Carlo effort within ASTRO-DF is sensitive to algorithm trajectory, sampling
more whenever an iterate is inferred to be close to a critical point and less
when far away. We demonstrate the almost-sure convergence of ASTRO-DF's
iterates to a first-order critical point when using linear or quadratic
stochastic interpolation models. The question of using more complicated models,
e.g., regression or stochastic kriging, in combination with adaptive sampling

of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) we derive the TMDFJF from both a
factorized SCET cross section and the TMD fragmentation function defined in the
literature. The TMDFJFs are factorized into distinct collinear and
soft-collinear modes by matching onto SCET$_+$. As TMD calculations contain
rapidity divergences, both the renormalization group (RG) and rapidity
renormalization group (RRG) must be used to provide resummed calculations with
next-to-leading-logarithm prime (NLL') accuracy. We apply our formalism to the
production of $J/\psi$ within jets initiated by gluons. In this case the TMDFJF
can be calculated in terms of NRQCD (Non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics)
fragmentation functions. We find that when the $J/\psi$ carries a significant
fraction of the jet energy, the $p_T$ and $z$ distributions differ for
different NRQCD production mechanisms. Another observable with discriminating
power is the average angle that the $J/\psi$ makes with the jet axis.

weighted relationships among a fixed group of objects. While community
detection has proven to be a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of
single-layer networks, the development of community detection methods for
multilayer networks is still in its infancy. We propose and investigate a
procedure, called Multilayer Extraction, that identifies densely connected
vertex-layer sets in multilayer networks. Multilayer Extraction makes use of a
significance based score that quantifies the connectivity of an observed
vertex-layer set through comparison with a fixed degree random graph model.
Multilayer Extraction directly handles networks with heterogeneous layers where
community structure may be different from layer to layer. The procedure can
capture overlapping communities, as well as background vertex-layer pairs that
do not belong to any community. We establish consistency of the vertex-layer
set optimizer of our proposed multilayer score under the multilayer stochastic
block model. We investigate the performance of Multilayer Extraction on three
applications and a test bed of simulations. Our theoretical and numerical
evaluations suggest that Multilayer Extraction is an effective exploratory tool
for analyzing complex multilayer networks. Publicly available R software for
Multilayer Extraction is available at

source locations to a common sink with the goal of minimizing their individual
costs, where the cost of an edge is divided equally among the agents using it.
Since the work of Anshelevich et al. (FOCS 2004) that introduced network design
games, the main open problem in this field has been the price of stability
(PoS) of multicast games. For the special case of broadcast games (every vertex
is a terminal, i.e., has an agent), a series of works has culminated in a
constant upper bound on the PoS (Bilo` et al., FOCS 2013). However, no
significantly sub-logarithmic bound is known for multicast games. In this
paper, we make progress toward resolving this question by showing a constant
upper bound on the PoS of multicast games for quasi-bipartite graphs. These are
graphs where all edges are between two terminals (as in broadcast games) or
between a terminal and a nonterminal, but there is no edge between
nonterminals. This represents a natural class of intermediate generality
between broadcast and multicast games. In addition to the result itself, our
techniques overcome some of the fundamental difficulties of analyzing the PoS
of general multicast games, and are a promising step toward resolving this
major open problem.

several modifications: A log-domain stabilized formulation, the well-known
epsilon-scaling heuristic, an adaptive truncation of the kernel and a

smaller regularization and negligible truncation error. A new convergence

exact diagonalization calculations. The proposed parametrization is pivotal for
the algorithmic development of all quantum many-body methods based on vertex
functions arising from both local and non-local static microscopic interactions
as well as effective dynamic interactions which uniformly approach a static
value for large frequencies. In this way, our present technique can
substantially improve vertex-based diagrammatic approaches including spatial
correlations beyond dynamical mean-field theory.

critical role in massive-star evolution, but their place in the evolutionary
sequence remains debated. A key to understanding their peculiar instability is
their high observed luminosities, which often depends on uncertain distances.
Here we report direct distances and space motions of four canonical Milky Way
LBVs---AG~Car, HR~Car, HD~168607, and (candidate) Hen~3-519---from the Gaia
first data release. Whereas the distances of HR~Car and HD~168607 are
consistent with previous literature estimates within the considerable
uncertainties, Hen~3-519 and AG~Car, both at $\sim$2~kpc, are much closer than
the 6--8~kpc distances previously assumed. As a result, Hen~3-519 moves far
from the locus of LBVs on the HR Diagram, making it a much less luminous
object. For AG~Car, considered a defining example of a classical LBV, its lower
luminosity would also move it off the S~Dor instability strip. Lower
luminosities allow both AG~Car and Hen~3-519 to have passed through a previous
red supergiant phase, lower the mass estimates for their shell nebulae, and
imply that binary evolution is needed to account for their peculiarities. These
results may also impact our understanding of LBVs as potential supernova
progenitors and their isolated environments. Improved distances will be
provided in the Gaia second data release, which will include additional LBVs.
AG~Car and Hen~3-519 hint that this new information may alter our traditional
view of LBVs.

understand the deposition of heat on walls, the effect of sputtering, and
contamination of the plasma with detrimental impurities. The plasma sheath also
provides a boundary condition and can often have a significant global impact on
the bulk plasma. In this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are
performed with the continuum code, Gkeyll, that directly solves the
Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell equations. The code uses a novel version of the
finite-element discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme that conserves energy in the
continuous-time limit. The electrostatic field is computed using the Poisson
equation. Ionization and scattering collisions are included, however, surface
effects are neglected. The aim of this work is to introduce the
continuum-kinetic method and compare its results to those obtained from an
already established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in Gkeyll.
Novel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without
specifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at
the wall. The work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid
results are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain
regimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the
plasma boundary. There are differences in the electrostatic potential between
the fluid and kinetic results. Further, the direct solutions of the
distribution function presented here highlight the non-Maxwellian distribution
of electrons in the sheath, emphasizing the need for a kinetic model.

splitting algorithms, the concave part might be the composition of a concave
function with a linear operator, which are, however, evaluated separately.
  For this algorithm we show that every cluster point is a solution of the
optimization problem. Furthermore, we show the connection to the Toland dual
problem and prove a descent property for the objective function values of a
primal-dual formulation of the problem. Convergence of the iterates is shown if
this objective function satisfies the Kurdyka--\L ojasiewicz property. In the

induces a connected subgraph. Following analogous studies in the literature
related to independent sets, dominating sets, and total dominating sets, we
study in this paper the class of graphs in which the connected dominating sets
can be separated from the other vertex subsets by a linear weight function.
More precisely, we say that a graph is connected-domishold if it admits
non-negative real weights associated to its vertices such that a set of
vertices is a connected dominating set if and only if the sum of the
corresponding weights exceeds a certain threshold. We characterize the graphs
in this non-hereditary class in terms of a property of the set of minimal
cutsets of the graph. We give several characterizations for the hereditary
case, that is, when each connected induced subgraph is required to be
connected-domishold. The characterization by forbidden induced subgraphs
implies that the class properly generalizes two well known classes of chordal
graphs, the block graphs and the trivially perfect graphs. Finally, we study
certain algorithmic aspects of connected-domishold graphs. Building on
connections with minimal cutsets and properties of the derived hypergraphs and
Boolean functions, we show that our approach leads to new polynomially solvable
cases of the weighted connected dominating set problem.

interaction between the spin-orbit field and the spin misalignment that
electrons acquire in magnetically noncollinear textures. This interpretation
provides also an intuitive understanding of the symmetry of DMI on the basis of
the spin-orbit field and it explains in a simple way why DMI and ground-state
spin currents are related. Moreover, we show that energy currents driven by
magnetization dynamics and associated to DMI can be explained by
counter-propagating spin currents that carry energy due to their Zeeman
interaction with the spin-orbit field. Finally, we discuss options to modify
DMI by nonequilibrium spin currents excited by electric fields or light.

Lorentzian-shaped resonance with a width of 6.2 kHz, indicative of a very
sparse distribution of protons attached to the silicon surface. These protons
are within a few atomic monolayers of the silicon surface. The high sensitivity
NMR detection of surface protons from low surface area ($0.26 - 1.3 \: m^2/g$)
particles is enabled by an overall signal enhancement of 4150 over the room
temperature NMR signal at the same field. When the particles were suspended in
a solvent with 80% H2O and 20% D2O, the narrow peak was observed to grow in
intensity over time, indicating growth of the sparse surface proton layer.
However, when the particles were suspended in a solvent with 20% H2O and 80%
D2O, the narrow bound-proton peak was observed to shrink due to exchange
between the surface protons and the deuterium in solution. This decrease was
accompanied by a concomitant growth in the intensity of the frozen solvent
peak, as the relative proton concentration of the solvent increased. When the
particles were suspended in the organic solvent hexane, the proton NMR spectra
remained unchanged over time. These results are consistent with the known
chemisorption of water on the silicon surface resulting in the formation of
hydride and hydroxyl species. Low-temperature DNP NMR can thus be used as a
non-destructive probe of surface corrosion for silicon in aqueous environments.
This is important in the context of using silicon MEMS and bioMEMS devices in
such environments, for silicon micro- and nano-particle MRI imaging agents, and
the use of nanosilicon for splitting water in fuel cells.

spacetimes which satisfy Einstein's gravitational field equations. To date,
Einstein's theory has been enormously successful in modeling observed
gravitational phenomena, both at the astrophysical and the cosmological levels.
  The collection of spacetime solutions of Einstein's equations which have been
effectively used for modeling the physical universe is a very small subset of
the full set of solutions. Among this larger set, there are many spacetimes in
which strange phenomena related to time are present: There are solutions
containing regions in which determinism and the predictability of experimental
outcomes breaks down (the Taub-NUT spacetimes), and there others in which the
breakdown of determinism occurs everywhere (the G\""odel universe).
  Should the existence of these strange solutions lead us to question the
usefulness of Einstein's theory in modeling physical phenomena? Should it
instead lead us to seriously search for strange time phenomena in physics? Or
should we simply treat these solutions as anomalous (if embarrassing)
distractions which we can ignore?
  In this essay, after introducing some basic ideas of special and general
relativity and discussing what it means for a spacetime to be a solution of
Einstein's equations, we explore the use of spacetime solutions for modeling
astrophysical events and cosmology. We then examine some of the spacetime
solutions in which determinism and causal relationships break down, we relate

its path through the network. However, as this increases the end-to-end latency
it is not ideal for applications like Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication, where
participants will notice annoying delays if the data does not arrive fast
enough. We propose an approach based on the paradigm of Dining Cryptographer

small groups. The main features of our approach are low latency and resilience
to packet-loss and fault packets sent by malicious players. We consider the

are two broad families of approaches that have been shown useful in effective
brain connectivity studies. While VARMs postulate that a given region of
interest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of
time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that causal dependencies arise due to
contemporaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are
not necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary
perspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that
leverage both contemporaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put
forth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they
are incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series.
To this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably
broaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels,
which have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in
canonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and
dimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here
to the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient
regularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to
real-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected
dictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach. Extensive
numerical tests on ECoG data captured through a study on epileptic seizures
demonstrate that it is possible to unveil previously unknown causal links

extension of Turing machines with interaction. RTMs are used to define the
notion of executable transition system in the same way as Turing machines are
used to define the notion of computable function on natural numbers. RTMs
inherited finiteness of all sets involved from Turing machines, and as a
consequence, in a single step, an RTM can only communicate elements from a
finite set of data. Some process calculi, such as the pi-calculus, essentially
depend on an infinite alphabet of actions, and hence it immediately follows
that transition systems specified in these calculi are not executable. On
closer inspection, however, the pi-calculus does not appear to use the infinite
data in a non-computable manner.
  In this paper, we investigate several ways to relax the finiteness
requirement. We start by considering a variant of RTMs in which all sets are
allowed to be countable, and we get a notion of infinitary RTM. Infinitary RTMs
are extremely expressive such that we can hardly use them as a expressiveness
criterion. Then, we refine the model by adding extra restrictions. As a result,
we define a notion of RTM with atoms. It is a more restricted variant of RTMs
in which the sets of actions and data symbols are still allowed to be infinite.
We propose a notion of of nominal executability based on RTMs with atoms, and
show that every effective transition system with atoms is nominally executable.
It will follow that processes definable in the pi-calculus are nominally
executable. In contrast, in the process specification language mCRL2 it is
possible to specify processes that are not nominally executable. Thus, nominal
executability provides a new expressiveness criterion for process calculi.

eV. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at supernova remnant (SNR) shock fronts
is thought to accelerate galactic CRs to energies below the knee, while an
extragalactic origin is presumed for CRs with energies beyond the ankle. CRs
with energies between $3 \times 10^{15}$ and $10^{18}$ eV, which we dub the

termination shocks, rather than at SNR shocks, may accelerate CRs to these
energies. This paper uses the galactic wind model of Bustard et al. (2016) to
analyze whether galactic wind termination shocks may accelerate CRs to shin
energies within a reasonable acceleration time and whether such CRs can
subsequently diffuse back to the galaxy. We argue for acceleration times on the
order of 100 Myrs rather than a few billion years, as assumed in some previous
works, and we discuss prospects for magnetic field amplification at the shock
front. Ultimately, we generously assume that the magnetic field is amplified to
equipartition. This formalism allows us to obtain analytic formulae, applicable
to any wind model, for CR acceleration. Even with generous assumptions, we find
that very high wind velocities are required to set up the necessary conditions

the in situ stellar mass growth of galaxies purely as a stationary stochastic

processes with Newtonian gravity and a mean local star formation efficiency, we
show that the stellar mass evolution of galaxy ensembles is directly related to
the average acceleration of baryons onto dark matter halos at the onset of star
formation, with explicit dependencies on initial local matter densities and
halo mass. The density term specifically implies more rapid average rates of
growth in higher density regions of the universe compared to low density
regions, i.e., assembly bias. With this framework, using standard cosmological
parameters, a mean star formation efficiency derived by other authors, and
knowledge of the shape of the cosmological matter power spectrum at small
scales, we analytically derive (1) the characteristic stellar masses of
galaxies (M*), (2) the power-law low-mass slope (alpha) and normalization
(phi*) of the stellar mass function, and (3) the evolution of the stellar mass
function in time over 12.5 > z > 2. Correspondingly, the rise in the cosmic
star formation rate density over these epochs, while the universe can sustain
unabated fueling of star formation, also emerges naturally. All of our findings
are consistent with the deepest available data, including the expectation of
alpha~-7/5; i.e., a stellar mass function low-mass slope that is notably
shallower than that of the halo mass function, and with no systematic
deviations from a mean star formation efficiency with density or mass, nor any
explicit, additional feedback mechanisms. These derivations yield a compelling
richness and complexity but also show that very few astrophysical details are

not well understood, and in particular, it is unclear if rotation plays a major
role in cloud evolution. We investigate the importance of rotation in cloud
evolution by studying the kinematic structure of a spiral-shaped Galactic
molecular cloud G052.24+00.74. The cloud belongs to a large filament, and is
stretching over ~ 100 pc above the Galactic disk midplane. The spiral-shaped
morphology of the cloud suggests that the cloud is rotating. We have analysed
the kinematic structure of the cloud, and study the fragmentation and star
formation. We find that the cloud exhibits a regular velocity pattern along
west-east direction - a velocity shift of ~ 10 km/s at a scale of ~ 30 pc. The
kinematic structure of the cloud can be reasonably explained by a model that
assumes rotational support. Similarly to our Galaxy, the cloud rotates with a
prograde motion. We use the formalism of Toomre (1964) to study the cloud's
stability, and find that it is unstable and should fragment. The separation of
clumps can be consistently reproduced assuming gravitational instability,
suggesting that fragmentation is determined by the interplay between rotation
and gravity. Star formation occurs in massive, gravitational bound clumps.

Coleman-Weinberg potential. The time-averaged motion of the evolving fixed

occurs via electron capture with a fixed half-life of 6.1 days. However, this

K-shell electrons are unavailable for capture. In this paper, we explore the
effect of these delayed decays on white dwarfs (WDs) that may survive Type Ia

delayed radioactive decays of 56Ni and 56Co drives a persistent wind from the
surviving WD's surface that contributes to the late-time appearance of these
SNe after emission from the bulk of the SN ejecta has faded. We use the stellar
evolution code MESA to calculate the hydrodynamical evolution and resulting
light curves of these winds. Our post-SN Ia models conflict with late-time
observations of SN 2011fe, but uncertainties in our initial conditions prevent
us from ruling out the existence of surviving WD donors. Much better agreement
with observations is achieved with our post-SN Iax bound remnant models,
providing evidence that these explosions are due to deflagrations in accreting
WDs that fail to completely unbind the WDs. Future radiative transfer
calculations and wind models utilizing explosion simulations for more accurate
initial conditions will extend our study of radioactively-powered winds from
post-SN surviving WDs and enable their use as powerful discriminants among the
various SN Ia and SN Iax progenitor scenarios.

spanned by this new dataset (3-4 dex over the full redshift range) is
sufficient to clearly demonstrate for the first time that the faint-end slope
of the KLF at z>0.25 is relatively steep (-1.3<alpha<-1.5 for a single
Schechter function), in good agreement with recent theoretical and
phenomenological models. Moreover, based on our new dataset we find that a
double Schechter function provides a significantly improved description of the
KLF at z<2. At redshifts z>0.25 the evolution of the KLF is remarkably smooth,
with little or no evolution evident at faint (M_K>-20.5) or bright magnitudes
(M_K<-24.5). Instead, the KLF is seen to evolve rapidly at intermediate
magnitudes, with the number density of galaxies at M_K~-23 dropping by a factor
of ~5 over the redshift interval 0.25<z<3.75. Motivated by this, we explore a
simple description of the evolving KLF based on a double Schechter function
with fixed faint-end slopes (alpha_1=-0.5, alpha_2=-1.5) and a shared
characteristic magnitude (M_K*). According to this parameterisation, the
normalisation of the component which dominates the faint-end of the KLF remains
approximately constant, with phi*_2 decreasing by only a factor of ~2 between
z~0 and z~3.25. In contrast, the component which dominates the bright end of
the KLF at low redshifts evolves dramatically, becoming essentially negligible
by z~3. Finally, we note that within this parameterisation, the observed
evolution of M_K* between z~0 and z~3.25 is entirely consistent with M_K*
corresponding to a constant stellar mass of M*~5x10^10 Msun at all redshifts.

EW(Ly$\alpha$) $\gtrsim 150$ \AA{}, at $z>6$ are good candidates for Ly$\alpha$

of their unusual colors. We have conducted a photometric search for such

report here the identification of three likely gravitationally-lensed images of
a single LAE candidate at $z\sim6.3$, behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2261($z =

study the properties of the candidate LAE. Population III galaxy spectral

possible LAE provide a slightly better fit than Population I/II models. The
best fitted model suggests intrinsic EW(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx 160$ \AA{} after
absorption in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Future spectroscopic

We show that a simulation in which gas cooling in massive dark haloes is

This is a common problem in simulations in which star formation in massive
galaxies is quenched either by quasar- or radio-mode AGN feedback. The early
suppression of gas cooling in progenitors of massive galaxies prevents them
from recapturing enriched gas ejected as winds. Simultaneously reproducing the

difficult in the current framework of galaxy formation.

Supernova explosions are injected either at random locations, at density peaks,

circulates between the ISM phases and find more sizeable transitions than
considered in simple mass exchange schemes in the literature. The derived
residence times in the ISM phases are characterised by broad distributions, in
particular for the molecular, warm and hot medium. The most realistic

high metallicity (mass) galaxies with high velocity fields that facilitates
easy Ly$\alpha$ escape. The measured Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness requires
local ionizing radiation that is 4 to 10 times stronger than the metagalactic

are studied. Using a large suite of simulations, we find that the
non-Gaussianity in the covariance is significant already at mildly nonlinear
scales. We compute the leading disconnected non-Gaussian correction to the
matter bispectrum covariance using perturbation theory, and find that the
corrections result in good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. The shot
noise contribution to the halo power spectrum and bispectrum covariance is
computed using the Poisson model, and the model yields decent agreement with
simulation results. However, when the shot noise is estimated from the
individual realization, which is usually done in reality, we find that the halo
covariance is substantially reduced and gets close to the Gaussian covariance.
This is because most of the non-Gaussianity in the covariance arises from the
fluctuations in the Poisson shot noise. We use the measured non-Gaussian
covariance to access the information content of the power spectrum and
bispectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the matter and halo power
spectrum levels off in the mildly nonlinear regime, $k \sim 0.1 - 0.2
\,\mathrm{Mpc} h^{-1}$. In the nonlinear regime the S/N of the matter and halo
bispectrum increases but much slower than the Gaussian results suggest. We find
that both the S/N for power spectrum and bispectrum are overestimated by the
Gaussian covariances, but the problem being much more serious for the
bispectrum. Because the bispectrum is affected strongly by nonlinearity and
shot noise, inclusion of the bispectrum only adds modest amount of S/N compared
to that of the power spectrum.

fundamental scaling laws remain poorly understood in the highly supersonic,
magnetized, shearing regime relevant for the ISM. We therefore study the full
scaling laws governing passive-scalar transport in idealized simulations of
supersonic turbulence. Using simple phenomenological arguments for the
variation of diffusivity with scale based on Richardson diffusion, we propose a
simple fractional diffusion equation to describe the turbulent advection of an
initial passive scalar distribution. These predictions agree well with the
measurements from simulations, and vary with turbulent Mach number in the
expected manner, remaining valid even in the presence of a large-scale shear
flow (e.g. rotation in a galactic disk). The evolution of the scalar
distribution is not the same as obtained using simple, constant ""effective
diffusivity"" as in Smagorinsky models, because the scale-dependence of
turbulent transport means an initially Gaussian distribution quickly develops
highly non-Gaussian tails. We also emphasize that these are mean scalings that
only apply to ensemble behaviors (assuming many different, random scalar
injection sites): individual Lagrangian ""patches"" remain coherent
(poorly-mixed) and simply advect for a large number of turbulent flow-crossing
times.

individual fluorescent-labeled actin segments at varying times throughout the
strain and varying distances from the strain path to determine the underlying
molecular dynamics that give rise to the debated nonlinear response and stress
propagation of crosslinked and entangled actin networks at the microscale. We
show that initial stress stiffening arises from acceleration of strained
filaments due to molecular extension along the strain, while softening and
yielding is coupled to filament deceleration, halting and recoil. We
demonstrate a surprising non-monotonic dependence of velocity profiles on
crosslinker concentration. Namely, networks with no crosslinks or substantial
crosslinks both exhibit fast initial filament velocities and reduced molecular
recoil while intermediate crosslinker concentrations display reduced velocities
and increased recoil. We show that these collective results are due to a
balance of network elasticity and transient crosslinker unbinding and
rebinding. We further show that elasticity and relaxation timescales display an
exponential dependence on crosslinker concentration that reveal that crosslinks
dominate entanglement dynamics when the length between crosslinkers becomes
smaller than the length between entanglements. In accord with recent
simulations, our relaxation dynamics demonstrate that post-strain stress can be
long-lived in crosslinked networks by distributing stress to a small fraction
of highly-strained connected filaments that span the network and sustain the
load, thereby allowing the rest of the network to recoil and relax.

established that variations in the radial velocity are primarily caused by the
photo-evaporating ionization front being viewed at different angles. There is a
progressive increase of the electron temperature and density with decreasing
distance from the dominant ionizing star Theta1 Ori C. The product of these
characteristics (NexTe) is the most relevant parameter in modeling a
blister-type nebula like the Huygens Region, where this quantity should vary
with the surface brightness in Halpha. Several lines of evidence indicate that
small-scale structure and turbulence exists down to the level of our resolution
of a few arcseconds. Although photo-evaporative ow must contribute at some
level to the well-known non-thermal broadening of the emission lines,
comparison of quantitative predictions with the observed optical line widths
indicate that it is not the major additive broad- ening component. Derivation
of Te values for H+ from radio+optical and optical-only ionized hydro- gen

are used to transmit information. Because neural spiking is noisy, spiking
patterns are often quantified via pairwise correlations, or the probability
that two cells will spike coincidentally, above and beyond their baseline
firing rate. One observation frequently made in experiments, is that
correlations can increase systematically with firing rate. Theoretical studies
have determined that stimulus-dependent correlations that increase with firing
rate can have beneficial effects on information coding; however, we still have
an incomplete understanding of what circuit mechanisms do, or do not, produce
this correlation-firing rate relationship.
  Here, we study the relationship between pairwise correlations and firing
rates in recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with
conductance-based synapses. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, a
positive relationship emerges between pairwise correlations and firing rates.
To explain these findings, we used linear response theory to predict the full
correlation matrix and to decompose correlations in terms of graph motifs. We
then used this decomposition to explain why covariation of correlations with
firing rate -- a relationship previously explained in feedforward networks
driven by correlated input -- emerges in some recurrent networks but not in
others. Furthermore, when correlations covary with firing rate, this
relationship is reflected in low-rank structure in the correlation matrix.

80 pc, or a post-main sequence G giant at d ~ 300 pc is still not clear. As a
first-ascent giant, it is the first to be observed with a molecular and dust
disk. Alternatively, BP Psc would be among the nearest T Tauri stars with a
protoplanetary disk (PPD). We investigate whether the disk geometry resembles
typical PPDs, by comparing polarimetric images with radiative transfer models.
Our VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations allow us to perform Polarimetric
Differential Imaging; Reference Star Differential Imaging; and Richardson-Lucy
deconvolution. We present the first visible light polarization and intensity
images of the disk of BP Psc. Our deconvolution confirms the disk shape as
detected before, mainly showing the southern side of the disk. In polarized
intensity the disk is imaged at larger detail and also shows the northern side,
giving it the typical shape of high inclination flared disks. We explain the
observed disk features by retrieving the large-scale geometry with MCMax
radiative transfer modeling, which yields a strongly flared model, atypical for
disks of T Tauri stars.

ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1 ($L_{\rm{X}} > 10^{40}$ erg/s),
performed by $Suzaku$ and $NuSTAR$ in coordination. Combined with the archival
data, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six
separate epochs. Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen
previously, allowing us to extend our knowledge of the broadband spectral
variability exhibited. The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody
components, which dominate the emission below 10 keV, as well as a steep
($\Gamma \sim 3.5$) powerlaw tail which dominates above $\sim$15 keV.
Remarkably, while the 0.3-10.0 keV flux varies by a factor of $\sim$3 between
all these epochs, the 15-40 keV flux varies by only $\sim$20%. Although the
spectral variability is strongest in the $\sim$1-10 keV band, both of the
thermal components are required to vary when all epochs are considered. We also
re-visit the search for iron absorption features, leveraging the high-energy
$NuSTAR$ data to improve our sensitivity to extreme velocity outflows in light
of the ultra-fast outflow recently detected in NGC 1313 X-1. Iron absorption
from a similar outflow along our line of sight can be ruled out in this case.
We discuss these results in the context of super-Eddington accretion models
that invoke a funnel-like geometry for the inner flow, and propose a scenario
in which we have an almost face-on view of a funnel that expands to larger
radii with increasing flux, resulting in an increasing degree of geometrical
collimation for the emission from intermediate temperature regions.

first propose an efficient optimal SMP algorithm with an $\bigO(n^2)$ memory

a suitable suboptimal solution, which is then updated, via a novel algorithm
with only $\bigO(n^2)$ flops in each updating, until $\A^{\star}$ is obtained.
Different from existing algorithms which find $\A^\star$ column by column
through using a sphere decoding search strategy $n$ times, the new algorithm
uses a search strategy once only. We then rigorously prove the optimality of
the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze its complexity.
In particular, we not only show that the new algorithm is $\Omega(n)$ times
faster than the most efficient existing algorithm with polynomial memory
complexity, but also assert that it is even more efficient than the most
efficient existing algorithm with exponential memory complexity. Finally,
numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the optimality and efficiency

lattice without long-range magnetic order, is clearly quite important in
iron-based superconductors. From a symmetry point of view, nematic order can be
described as a coherent locking of spin fluctuations in two interpenetrating
N\'eel sublattices with ensuing nearest-neighbor bond order and an absence of
static magnetism. Here, we argue that the low-temperature state of the recently
discovered superconductor BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O is a strong candidate for a more
exotic form of spin-driven nematic order, in which fluctuations occurring in
four N\'eel sublattices promote both nearest- and next-nearest neighbor bond
order. We develop a low-energy field theory of this state and show that it can
have, as a function of temperature, up to two separate bond-order phase
transitions -- namely, one that breaks rotation symmetry and one that breaks
reflection and translation symmetries of the lattice. The resulting state has
an orthorhombic lattice distortion, an intra-unit-cell charge density wave, and
no long-range magnetic order, all consistent with reported measurements of the
low-temperature phase of BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O. We then use density functional theory
calculations to extract exchange parameters to confirm that the model is

electromagnetic spectrum and showing variability on time scales from minutes to
years. For the understanding of the emission mechanisms, simultaneous
multi-wavelength observations are crucial. Various models for flares predict
simultaneous flux increases in the X-ray and gamma-ray band or more complex
variability patterns, depending on the dominant process responsible for the
gamma-ray emission. Monitoring at TeV energies is providing important
information to distinguish between different models. To study duty cycle and
variability time scales of an object, an unbiased data sample is essential, and
good sensitivity and continuous monitoring are needed to resolve smaller time
scales. A dedicated long-term monitoring program at TeV energies has been
started by the FACT project. Its success clearly illustrated that the usage of
silicon based photo sensors (SIPMs) is ideal for long-term monitoring. They
provide not only an excellent and stable detector performance, but also allow
for observations during bright ambient light minimizing observational gaps and
increasing the instrument's duty cycle. The observation time in a single
longitude is limited to 6 hours. To study typical variability time scales of
few hours to one day, the ultimate goal is 24/7 monitoring with a network of
small telescopes around the globe (DWARF project). The installation of an
Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope is planned in San Pedro Martir, Mexico. For the
M@TE (Monitoring at TeV energies) telescope, a mount from a previous experiment
is being refurbished to be equipped with a camera using the new generation of
SiPMs. In the presentation, the status of the M@TE project will be reported
outlining the scientific potential, including the possibility to extend
monitoring campaigns to 12 hours by coordinated observations together with

Numerical simulations have shown that the system's dynamics alternates between
these two steady states through a first order transition. Depending on the

monitoring, either with dedicated telescopes in pointing mode or survey
instruments. At TeV energies, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
observatory monitors approximately two thirds of the sky every day. It uses the
water Cherenkov technique, which provides an excellent duty cycle independent
of weather and season. The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) monitors a
small sample of sources with better sensitivity, using the imaging air
Cherenkov technique. Thanks to its camera with silicon-based photosensors, FACT
features an excellent detector performance and stability and extends its
observations to times with strong moonlight, increasing the duty cycle compared
to other imaging air Cherenkov telescopes. As FACT and HAWC have overlapping
energy ranges, a joint study can exploit the longer daily coverage given that
the observatories' locations are offset by 5.3 hours. Furthermore, the better
sensitivity of FACT adds a finer resolution of features on hour-long time
scales, while the continuous duty cycle of HAWC ensures evenly sampled
long-term coverage. Thus, the two instruments complement each other to provide
a more complete picture of blazar variability. In this presentation, the first

long-term measurements with daily sampling between air and water Cherenkov

in which observed data depends on high-dimensional latent variables that, in
turn, depend on relatively few hyperparameters. When the full conditional over
the latent variables has a known form, the marginal posterior distribution over
hyperparameters is accessible and can be sampled using a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method on a low-dimensional parameter space. This may improve
computational efficiency over standard Gibbs sampling since computation is not
over the high-dimensional space of latent variables and correlations between
hyperparameters and latent variables become irrelevant. When the marginal
posterior over hyperparameters depends on a fixed-dimensional sufficient
statistic, precomputation of the sufficient statistic renders the cost of the
low-dimensional MCMC independent of data size. Then, when the hyperparameters
are the primary variables of interest, inference may be performed in big-data
settings at modest cost. Moreover, since the form of the full conditional for
the latent variables does not depend on the form of the hyperprior
distribution, the method imposes no restriction on the hyperprior, unlike Gibbs
sampling that typically requires conjugate distributions. We demonstrate these
efficiency gains in four computed examples.

This mechanism, called a galactic shock wave, predicts that gas spiral arms
move from downstream to upstream of stellar arms with increasing radius inside
a corotation radius. In order to investigate if this mechanism is at work in
the grand-design spiral galaxy M51, we have measured azimuthal offsets between
the peaks of stellar mass and gas mass distributions in its two spiral arms.
The stellar mass distribution is created by the spatially resolved spectral
energy distribution fitting to optical and near infrared images, while the gas
mass distribution is obtained by high-resolution CO and HI data. For the inner
region (r < 150""), we find that one arm is consistent with the galactic shock
while the other is not. For the outer region, results are less certain due to
the narrower range of offset values, the weakness of stellar arms, and the
smaller number of successful offset measurements. The results suggest that the
nature of two inner spiral arms are different, which is likely due to an

  One of the goals of the study is to understand the relationship between
synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks in blazar SEDs and the reason for the
appearance of gamma-ray ""orphan flares"" observed in some blazars. This can be
associated with the directionality of the magnetic field, which creates a
difference in the radiation field as seen by an observer versus that seen by
the electrons in the emission region.

models of computation based on permuting distinguishable particles (which we
call balls), and characterize their computational complexity. In the quantum
setting, we find that the computational power of this model depends on the
initial input states. More precisely, with a standard basis input state, we
show how to approximate the amplitudes of this model within additive error
using the model DQC1 (the class of problems solvable with one clean qubit),
providing evidence that the model in this case is weaker than universal quantum
computing. However, for specific choices of input states, the model is shown to
be universal for BQP in an encoded sense. We use representation theory of the
symmetric group to partially classify the computational complexity of this
model for arbitrary input states. Interestingly, we find some input states
which yield a model intermediate between DQC1 and BQP. Furthermore, we consider
a restricted version of this model based on an integrable scattering problem in
1+1 dimensions. We show it is universal under postselection, if we allow
intermediate destructive measurements and specific input states. Therefore, the
existence of any classical procedure to sample from the output distribution of
this model within multiplicative error implies collapse of polynomial hierarchy
to its third level. Finally, we define a classical version of this model in
which one can probabilistically permute balls. We find this yields a complexity
class which is intermediate between L and BPP. Moreover, we find a
nondeterministic version of this model is NP-complete.

the Standard Model (SM), though in small amounts. This has been an incentive to
look for high-energy descriptions in which $CP$ violation is increased, thus
enhancing effects that are suppressed in the SM, such as the electric dipole
moments (EDMs) of elementary particles. In the present investigation, we point
out that charged currents in which axial couplings are different from vector
couplings are able to produce one-loop contributions to EDMs of charged leptons
if neutrinos are massive and if these currents violate $CP$. We develop our
discussion around charged currents involving heavy neutrinos and a $W'$ gauge
boson coupling to SM charged leptons. Using the most stringent bound on the
electron EDM, provided by the ACME Collaboration, we determine that the upper
bound on the difference between axial and vector currents lies within
$\sim10^{-10}$ and $\sim10^{-7}$ for heavy-neutrino masses between $0.5\,{\rm
TeV}$ and $6\,{\rm TeV}$ and if the $W'$ mass is within $0.45\,{\rm
TeV}-7\,{\rm TeV}$. This possibility is analyzed altogether with the anomalous
magnetic moments of charged leptons, among which we estimate, for the $\tau$
lepton, an anomalous magnetic moment contribution between $\sim10^{-8}$ and
$\sim10^{-10}$ for neutrino masses ranging from $0.5\,{\rm TeV}$ to $6\,{\rm
TeV}$ and a $W'$ mass between $0.45\,{\rm TeV}$ and $7\,{\rm TeV}$. The general
charged currents are also used to calculate the branching ratio for $\mu\to
e\gamma$, which gets suppressed if the set of masses of heavy neutrinos is
quasidegenerate. In a scenario of nondegenerate neutrino masses, we find that
regions of neutrino and $W'$ masses in which the contributions to this flavor
changing branching ratio are lower than the current upper bound exist. We show
that such regions can be widened if the $W'$ gauge boson mass is larger.

this line observing additional spectral lines. In that regard, we examined the
neighbour solar spectrum looking for spectral lines that could increase the
sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters. Interestingly, we discovered several
photospheric lines that greatly improve the photospheric sensitivity to the

chromospheric line that also belongs to the Ca II infrared triplet, i.e. the Ca

assemble into colloidal membranes, which are one rod-length thick liquid-like

monolayer membranes form open structures with an exposed edge, thus presenting
an opportunity to study physics of thin elastic sheets. Membranes assembled
from single-component chiral rods form flat disks with uniform edge twist. In
comparison, membranes comprised of mixture of rods with opposite chiralities
can have the edge twist of either handedness. In this limit disk-shaped
membranes become unstable, instead forming structures with scalloped edges,
where two adjacent lobes with opposite handedness are separated by a
cusp-shaped point defect. Such membranes adopt a 3D configuration, with cusp
defects alternatively located above and below the membrane plane. In the
achiral regime the cusp defects have repulsive interactions, but away from this
limit we measure effective long-ranged attractive binding. A phenomenological
model shows that the increase in the edge energy of scalloped membranes is
compensated by concomitant decrease in the deformation energy due to Gaussian
curvature associated with scalloped edges, demonstrating that colloidal
membranes have positive Gaussian modulus. A simple excluded volume argument
predicts the sign and magnitude of the Gaussian curvature modulus that is in
agreement with experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into how
the interplay between membrane elasticity, geometrical frustration and achiral

attractive features. First, there is no sign problem that plagues several
quantum Monte Carlo methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis-Hastings
sampling, we use the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the
reference wavefunction, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples.
Third, in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI)
is faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a stochastic error
of 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI algorithm one can trade
memory for a modest increase in computer time. Fifth, the perturbative
calculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI algorithm extends the range of
applicability of the original algorithm, allowing us to calculate the
correlation energy of very large active spaces. We demonstrate this by

large-scale Bayesian learning, with well-developed theoretical convergence

popular to employ distributed systems, where stochastic gradients are computed

While stale gradients could be directly used in SG-MCMC, their impact on
convergence properties has not been well studied. In this paper we develop
theory to show that while the bias and MSE of an SG-MCMC algorithm depend on
the staleness of stochastic gradients, its estimation variance (relative to the
expected estimate, based on a prescribed number of samples) is independent of
it. In a simple Bayesian distributed system with SG-MCMC, where stale gradients
are computed asynchronously by a set of workers, our theory indicates a linear
speedup on the decrease of estimation variance w.r.t. the number of workers.
Experiments on synthetic data and deep neural networks validate our theory,
demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of SG-MCMC with stale

emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC
(SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence
properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been
studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In
this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and
develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their
asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence
rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order
integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric
splitting integrator, the {\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior
average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$
iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler
integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs
are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size
counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic
and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method
in two large-scale real applications.

human in image retrieval and recognition, object detection, etc. In this paper,
three-sides efforts are made to accomplish the task. First, visual features
with bag-of-words representation, not single vector, are extracted to
characterize the image. To improve the performance, the idea of multi-view
learning is implemented and three kinds of features are provided, each one
corresponds to a single view. The information from three views is complementary
to each other, which can be unified together. Then a new distance function is
designed for bags by computing the weighted sum of the distances between
instances. The technique of metric learning is explored to construct a
data-dependent distance metric to measure the relationships between instances,
meanwhile between bags and images, more accurately. Last, a novel approach,
called MVML, is proposed, which optimizes the joint probability that every
image is similar with its nearest image. MVML learns multiple distance metrics,
each one models a single view, to unifies the information from multiple views.
The method can be solved by alternate optimization iteratively. Gradient ascent
and positive semi-definite projection are utilized in the iterations. Distance
comparisons verified that the new bag distance function is prior to previous
functions. In model evaluation, numerical experiments show that MVML with
multiple views performs better than single view condition, which demonstrates
that our model can assemble the complementary information efficiently and
measure the distance between images more precisely. Experiments on influence of
parameters and instance number validate the consistency of the method.

hard-to-survey populations that leverages social network connections through

prevalence of infections and risk behaviors of interest to public health, like
HIV/AIDS or condom use, it is rarely used to draw inferences about the
structural properties of social networks among such populations because it does
not typically collect the necessary data. Drawing on recent advances in
computer science, we introduce a set of data collection instruments and RDS
estimators for network clustering, an important topological property that has
been linked to a network's potential for diffusion of information, disease, and
health behaviors. We use simulations to explore how these estimators,
originally developed for random walk samples of computer networks, perform when
applied to RDS samples with characteristics encountered in realistic field
settings that depart from random walks. In particular, we explore the effects
of multiple seeds, without vs. with replacement, branching chains, imperfect
response rates, preferential recruitment, and misreporting of ties. We find
that clustering coefficient estimators retain desirable properties in RDS

characteristics using non-traditional sampling methods, and it expands RDS's

decoupling technique for integrated systems has been desired for the target

decoupling of optical elements by manipulating electromagnetic waves
microscopically, it is neither feasible nor necessary to control each unit
element in coupled systems when considering severe restrictions on material
parameters for cloaking. Here we develop the macroscopic approach to design
crosstalk-free regions in coupled optical systems. By inversely designing the
eigenstate which encompasses target elements, the stable decoupling of the
elements from the coupled system is achieved, being completely independent from
the random alteration of the decoupled region, and at the same time, allowing
coherent and scattering-free wave transport with desired spatial profiles. We
also demonstrate the decoupling in disordered systems, overcoming the transport
blockade from Anderson localization. Our results provide an attractive solution

essential to develop techniques to attenuate the impact of noise, while
maintaining the integrity of relevant information in images. We propose in this
work to extend the application of the Non-Local Means filter (NLM) to the
vector case and apply it for denoising multispectral images. The objective is
to benefit from the additional information brought by multispectral imaging
systems. The NLM filter exploits the redundancy of information in an image to
remove noise. A restored pixel is a weighted average of all pixels in the
image. In our contribution, we propose an optimization framework where we
dynamically fine tune the NLM filter parameters and attenuate its computational
complexity by considering only pixels which are most similar to each other in
computing a restored pixel. Filter parameters are optimized using Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) rather than using ad hoc means. Experiments have
been conducted on multispectral images corrupted with additive white Gaussian
noise and PSNR and similarity comparison with other approaches are provided to
illustrate the efficiency of our approach in terms of both denoising

that guarantees the modular symmetry of the experimental systems. Here we
formulate a lattice electric-field representation of the HXY model and contrast
this with an analogous representation of the Villain model and the
two-dimensional Coulomb gas with a purely rotational auxiliary field. We find
that the HXY model is a spin-model analogue of a lattice electric-field model
of the Coulomb gas with an auxiliary field, but with a temperature-dependent
vacuum (electric) permittivity that encodes the coupling of the spin vortices
to their background spin-wave medium. The spin vortices map to the Coulomb
charges, while the spin-wave fluctuations correspond to auxiliary-field
fluctuations. The coupling explains the striking differences in the
high-temperature asymptotes of the specific heats of the HXY model and the
Coulomb gas with an auxiliary field. Our results elucidate the propagation of
effective long-range interactions throughout the HXY model (whose interactions
are purely local) by the lattice electric fields. They also imply that global

decentralized nature of urban deployments, can be performed by means of
consensus algorithms. These algorithms allow distributed agents to
(iteratively) compute linear functions on the exchanged data, and take
decisions based on the outcome, without the need for the support of a central
entity. However, the use of consensus algorithms raises several security
concerns, especially when private or security critical information are involved

information fusion over encrypted data. ODIN is a privacy-preserving extension
of the popular consensus gossip algorithm, that prevents distributed agents

cannot access even the final consensus value, but can only retrieve partial

final decisions on the obfuscated consensus. We discuss the security of our

  We investigate a model class based on recent successful approaches,
consisting of a linear model that combines segmental features based on an LSTM
frame classifier. Similarly to hybrid HMM-neural network models, segmental
models of this class can be trained in two stages (frame classifier training
followed by linear segmental model weight training), end to end (joint training
of both frame classifier and linear weights), or with end-to-end fine-tuning

  We study segmental models trained end to end with hinge loss, log loss,
latent hinge loss, and marginal log loss. We consider several losses for the
case where training alignments are available as well as where they are not.

investigate an interplay of inhibition and multiplexing on the largest

that presence of the inhibitory coupling may lead to a very different behaviour

isolated networks depending upon network architecture of the individual layer.
We demonstrate that there is a transition from the Weibull to the Gumbel or to
the Frechet distribution as networks are multiplexed. Furthermore, for denser

increases indicating higher stability of larger systems.

low-frequency variations in deep densities and their associated influence on
ocean transports. At both latitudes, deep waters (below 1100 dbar) at the

geopotential thickness is about $0.15$ $\mbox{m}^2\mbox{s}^{-2}$ between

a gas of MW-coupled fermions with spin 1/2. The fundamental solitons and VAs
remain stable in the presence of an arbitrarily strong repulsive contact
interaction (in that case, the solitons are constructed analytically by means

higher-order VAs are more robust than their lower-order couterparts, on the

observed the by the STEREO imagers, and by Venus Express (VEX) in situ at 0.72
AU, 6 degree away from the Sun Earth line. The CME kinematics are calculated
using the drag-based and WSA-Enlil models, constrained by the arrival time at
VEX, resulting in the CME arrival time and speed at Earth. The CME magnetic
field strength is scaled with a power law from VEX to Wind. Our investigation
shows promising results for the Dst forecast (predicted: -96 and -114 nT (from
2 Dst models), observed: -71 nT), for the arrival speed (predicted: 531 +- 23

cheap low fidelity function (e.g. a computational experiment with a CFD code)
and an expensive high fidelity function (e.g. a wind tunnel experiment) to
generate a data sample in order to construct a regression model of a high

of the minimax errors allows us to identify cases when the variable fidelity
data provides better interpolation accuracy than the exclusively high fidelity

rapid (thermal fluctuation, film coalescence etc.) it is important to probe
interfacial dynamics at high deformation rates. Today, only few techniques
allow this, one of them being the characterisation of the propagation of
electrocapillary waves on the liquid surface. Traditionally, this technique has
been applied in a continuous mode (i.e. at constant frequency) in order to
ensure reliable accuracy. Here we explore the possibility to analyse the
propagation of an excited pulse in order to access the interfacial properties
in one single Fourier treatment over a wide range of frequencies. The main
advantage of this approach is that the measurement times and the required
liquid volumes can be reduced significantly. This occurs at the cost of
precision in the measurement, due partly to the presence of a pronounced
resonance of the liquid surface. The pulsed approach may therefore be used to
prescan the surface response before a more in-depth scan at constant frequency;
or to follow the changes of the interfacial properties during surfactant
adsorption.

fair sharing of Internet resources and auctioning of certain public goods where

returning much of the payments back to the agents in the form of rebates. We
identify a design criterion for {\em almost budget balance}, impose feasibility

at a convex optimization problem to identify the parameters of the rebate

a continuum of linear constraints. We propose a solution method that involves a

gap for the low-pressure and high-pressure phases as well as the frequencies

the open source code IonTracks, where the combined initial and general
recombination effects in principle can be predicted for any ion beam with
arbitrary particle-energy spectrum and temporal structure. IonTracks uses track
structure theory to distribute the charge carriers in ion tracks. The charge
carrier movements are governed by a pair of coupled differential equations,
based on fundamental physical properties as charge carrier drift, diffusion,
and recombination, which are solved numerically while the initial and general
charge carrier recombination is computed.
  The algorithm is numerically stable and in accordance with experimentally
validated theories for initial recombination in heavy ion tracks and general
recombination in a proton beam.
  IonTracks is validated against the Jaff\'e's and Boag's theory of
recombination in pulsed beams of multiple ion species. IonTracks is able to
calculate the correction factor for initial and general recombination losses in
parallel-plate ionization chambers. Even if only few experimental data on
recombination effects in ionization chambers are available today, the universal
concept of IonTracks is not limited to the ions investigated here. Future
experimental investigations of recombination in pulsed and possibly also
continuous ion beams may be conducted with IonTracks, which ultimately may lead

We propose an alternative, a grid-based localization approach using the
k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, to deal with the identified shortcomings. Our
proposal does not require any changes to the existing air traffic protocols and
transmitters, and is easily implemented using only low-cost,
commercial-off-the-shelf hardware.
  Using an algebraic multilateration algorithm for comparison, we evaluate our
approach using real-world flight data collected with our collaborative sensor
network OpenSky. We quantify its effectiveness in terms of aircraft location
accuracy, surveillance coverage, and the verification of false position data.
Our results show that the grid-based approach can increase the effective air
traffic surveillance coverage compared to multilateration by a factor of up to
2.5. As it does not suffer from dilution of precision, it is much more robust
in noisy environments and performs better in pre-existing, unplanned receiver
deployments.
  We further find that the mean aircraft location accuracy can be increased by
up to 41% in comparison with multilateration while also being able to pinpoint
the origin of potential spoofing attacks conducted from the ground.

respect to image transformations encountered during wild image capture?; (2)
how can we predict CNN sensitivity?; and (3) can we increase the robustness of
CNNs with respect to image degradations? To answer the first question, we
provide an extensive empirical sensitivity analysis of commonly used CNN
architectures (AlexNet, VGG19, GoogleNet) across various types of image
degradations. This allows for predicting CNN performance for new domains
comprised by images of lower quality or captured from a different viewpoint. We
also show how the sensitivity of CNN outputs can be predicted for single
images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that input layer dropout or pre-filtering
during test time only reduces CNN sensitivity for high levels of degradation.
  Experiments for fine-grained recognition tasks reveal that VGG19 is more
robust to severe image degradations than AlexNet and GoogleNet. However, small
intensity noise can lead to dramatic changes in CNN performance even for VGG19.

previously-known deterministic algorithms for edge-coloring employed at least
(2Delta - 1) colors, even though any graph admits an edge-coloring with Delta +
1 colors [V64]. Moreover, the previously-known deterministic algorithms that
employed at most O(Delta) colors required superlogarithmic time
[B15,BE10,BE11,FHK15]. In the current paper we devise deterministic
edge-coloring algorithms that employ only Delta + o(Delta) colors, for a very
wide family of graphs. Specifically, as long as the arboricity is a =
O(Delta^{1 - \epsilon}), for a constant epsilon > 0, our algorithm computes
such a coloring within {polylogarithmic} deterministic time. We also devise
significantly improved deterministic edge-coloring algorithms for {general
graphs} for a very wide range of parameters. Specifically, for any value $\chi$
in the range [4Delta, 2^{o(log Delta)} \cdot Delta], our \chi-edge-coloring
algorithm has smaller running time than the best previously-known
\chi-edge-coloring algorithms. Our algorithms are actually much more general,
since edge-coloring is equivalent to {vertex-coloring of line graphs.} Our
method is applicable to vertex-coloring of the family of graphs with {bounded
diversity} that contains line graphs, line graphs of hypergraphs, and many
other graphs.
  Our results are obtained using a novel technique that connects vertices or
edges in a certain way that reduces clique size. The resulting structures,
which we call {connectors}, can be colored more efficiently than the original
graph. Moreover, the color classes constitute simpler subgraphs that can be
colored even more efficiently using appropriate connectors. Hence, we recurse
until we obtain sufficiently simple structures that are colored directly. We
introduce several types of connectors that are useful for various scenarios.

relevant for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Therefore, the Amsterdam IADL
Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) was developed: a 70-item proxy-based tool with good
psychometric properties. We aimed to design a short version whilst preserving
its psychometric quality. METHODS: Study partners of subjects (n=1355), ranging
from cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q.
We selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining
missing data, Item Response Theory and input from respondents and experts. We
investigated internal consistency of the short version as well as concordance
with the original version. To assess its construct validity, we additionally
investigated concordance between the short version and the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Lastly, we
investigated differences in IADL scores between diagnostic groups across the
dementia spectrum. RESULTS: We selected 30 items covering the entire spectrum
of IADL functioning. Internal consistency (.98) and concordance with the
original version (.97) were very high. Concordance with the MMSE (.72) and DAD
(.87) scores was high. IADL impairment scores increased across the spectrum
from normal cognition to dementia. DISCUSSION: The A-IADL-Q Short Version
(A-IADL-Q-SV) consists of 30 items. The A-IADL-Q-SV has maintained the
psychometric quality of the original A-IADL-Q. As such, it is a concise measure
of functional decline.

windows to the formation and evolution of these stellar systems. The metal-rich
GCs in the Galactic bulge are an indispensable part of this picture, but the
high optical extinction in this region has prevented extensive research. In
this work, we use the high resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data
from APOGEE to study the chemical abundances of NGC 6553, which is one of the
most metal-rich bulge GCs. We identify ten red giants as cluster members using
their positions, radial velocities, iron abundances, and NIR photometry. Our
sample stars show a mean radial velocity of $-0.14\pm5.47$ km s$^{-1}$, and a
mean [Fe/H] of $-0.15\pm 0.05$. We clearly separate two populations of stars in
C and N in this GC for the first time. NGC 6553 is the most metal-rich GC where
the multiple stellar population phenomenon is found until now. Substantial
chemical variations are also found in Na, O, and Al. However, the two
populations show similar Si, Ca, and iron-peak element abundances. Therefore,
we infer that the CNO, NeNa, and MgAl cycles have been activated, but the MgAl
cycle is too weak to show its effect on Mg. Type Ia and Type II supernovae do
not seem to have significantly polluted the second generation stars. Comparing
with other GC studies, NGC 6553 shows similar chemical variations as other
relatively metal-rich GCs. We also confront current GC formation theories with
our results, and suggest possible avenues for improvement in the models.

the definition of this strategy with a research roadmap to capture the
economic, social and ethical, legal and political benefits associated with the
use of big data in Europe. The present roadmap considers the positive and
negative externalities associated with big data, maps research and innovation
topics in the areas of data management, processing, analytics, protection,
visualisation, as well as non-technical topics, to the externalities they can
tackle, and provides a time frame to address these topics in order to deliver
social impact, skills development and standardisation. Finally, it also
identifies what sectors will be most benefited by each of the research efforts.
The goal of the roadmap is to guide European research efforts to develop a
socially responsible big data economy, and to allow stakeholders to identify

discovered accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 is increasing at a
rate $\dot{P}_{\rm orb}=(3.89\pm0.15)\times 10^{-12}~\rm s\,s^{-1}$, which is
at least one order of magnitude higher than the value arising from the
conservative mass transfer. An ejection of mass loss rate of $10^{-9}~\rm
M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}$ from the donor star at the inner Lagrangian point
during the quiescence state could interpret the observed orbital period
derivative. However, it is unknown whether this source can offer such a high
mass loss rate. In this work, we attempt to investigate an evolutionary channel
towards SAX J1808.4-3658. Once the accretion disk becomes thermally and
viscously unstable, the spin-down luminosity of the millisecond pulsar and the
X-ray luminosity during outbursts are assumed to evaporate the donor star, and
the resulting winds carry away the specific orbital angular momentum at the
inner Lagrangian point. Our scenario could yield the observed orbital period,
the orbital period derivative, the peak X-ray luminosity during outbursts.
Low-mass X-ray binaries with a $1.0~\rm M_{\odot}$ donor star, and an orbital
period in the range of 0.8 - 1.5 d, may be the progenitor of SAX J1808.4-3658.
Our numerical calculations propose that the current donor star mass is $0.044
~\rm M_{\odot}$, which is in approximately agreement with the minimum mass of
the donor star. In addition, our scenario can also account for the formation of
black widows or the diamond planet like PSR J1719-1438.

imperative, logic, concurrent, functional, and object-oriented ones) can be
reduced to problems of solving Horn clause constraints on predicate variables
that represent unknown inductive invariants. This paper presents a novel Horn
constraint solving method based on inductive theorem proving: the method
reduces Horn constraint solving to validity checking of first-order formulas
with inductively defined predicates, which are then checked by induction on the
derivation of the predicates. To automate inductive proofs, we introduce a
novel proof system tailored to Horn constraint solving and use an SMT solver to
discharge proof obligations arising in the proof search. The main advantage of
the proposed method is that it can verify relational specifications across
programs in various paradigms where multiple function calls need to be analyzed
simultaneously. The class of specifications includes practically important ones
such as functional equivalence, associativity, commutativity, distributivity,
monotonicity, idempotency, and non-interference. Furthermore, our novel
combination of Horn clause constraints with inductive theorem proving enables
us to naturally and automatically axiomatize recursive functions that are
possibly non-terminating, non-deterministic, higher-order, exception-raising,
and over non-inductively defined data types. We have implemented a relational
verification tool for the OCaml functional language based on the proposed

based multi-user massive MIMO downlink system under joint impacts of channel
non-reciprocity (NRC) and imperfect channel state information (CSI). We
consider a generic and realistic NRC model that accounts for transceiver
frequency-response as well as mutual coupling mismatches at both user equipment
(UE) and base station (BS) sides. The analysis covers two most prominent forms
of linear precoding schemes, namely, zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum-ratio
transmission (MRT), and assumes that only the statistical properties of the
beamformed channel are used at the UE side to decode the received signal. Under
the approximation of i.i.d. Gaussian channels, closed-form analytical
expressions are derived for the effective signal to interference and noise
ratios (SINRs) and the corresponding capacity lower bounds. The expressions
show that, in moderate to high SNR, the additional interference caused by
imperfect NRC calibration can degrade the performance of both precoders
significantly. Moreover, ZF is shown to be more sensitive to NRC than MRT.
Numerical evaluations with practical NRC levels indicate that this performance
loss in the spectral efficiency can be as high as 42% for ZF, whereas it is
typically less than 13% for MRT. It is also shown that due to the NRC, the
asymptotic large-antenna performance of both precoders saturate to an identical
finite level. The derived analytical expressions provide useful tools and
valuable technical insight, e.g., into calculating the NRC calibration
requirements in BSs and UEs for any given specific performance targets in terms
of effective SINR or the system capacity bound.

to approximate molecular kinetics, equilibria, metastable states, and reaction
coordinates in terms of a state space discretization usually obtained by
clustering. Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced,
the variational approach (VA) of molecular kinetics and its special case the
time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to
approximate slow collective variables and molecular kinetics by linear
combinations of smooth basis functions or order parameters. While it is known
how to estimate MSMs from trajectories whose starting points are not sampled
from an equilibrium ensemble, this has not yet been the case for TICA and the
VA. Previous estimates from short trajectories, have been strongly biased and
thus not variationally optimal. Here, we employ Koopman operator theory and
ideas from dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extend the VA and TICA to
non-equilibrium data. The main insight is that the VA and TICA provide a
coefficient matrix that we call Koopman model, as it approximates the
underlying dynamical (Koopman) operator in conjunction with the basis set used.
This Koopman model can be used to compute a stationary vector to reweight the
data to equilibrium. From such a Koopman-reweighted sample, equilibrium
expectation values and variationally optimal reversible Koopman models can be
constructed even with short simulations. The Koopman model can be used to
propagate densities, and its eigenvalue decomposition provide estimates of
relaxation timescales and slow collective variables for dimension reduction.
Koopman models are generalizations of Markov state models, TICA and the linear
VA and allow molecular kinetics to be described without a cluster
discretization.

universality are the $Q^{-1}$ of certain thin films of amorphous silicon,
carbon and germanium. Recently, it was found that $Q^{-1}$ of amorphous silicon

temperature of the substrate during deposition. According to the tunneling
model, the reduction in $Q^{-1}$ at 1 kelvin implies a reduction in

coupling to phonons. In this preliminary report, we demonstrate elastic

formation and composition. Since the CO snowline is difficult to observe
directly with CO emission, its location has been inferred in several disks from
spatially resolved ALMA observations of DCO+ and N2H+. N2H+ is considered to be
a good tracer of the CO snowline based on astrochemical considerations
predicting an anti-correlation between N2H+ and gas-phase CO. In this work, the
robustness of N2H+ as a tracer of the CO snowline is investigated. A simple
chemical network is used in combination with the radiative transfer code LIME
to model the N2H+ distribution and corresponding emission in the disk around TW
Hya. The assumed CO and N2 abundances, corresponding binding energies, cosmic
ray ionization rate, and degree of large-grain settling are varied to determine
the effects on the N2H+ emission and its relation to the CO snowline. For the
adopted physical structure of the TW Hya disk and molecular binding energies
for pure ices, the balance between freeze-out and thermal desorption predicts a
CO snowline at 19 AU, corresponding to a CO midplane freeze-out temperature of
20 K. A model with a total, i.e. gas plus ice, CO abundance of 3e-6 with
respect to H2 fits the position of the emission peak observed by Qi et al. 2013
for the TW Hya disk. However, the relationship between N2H+ and the CO snowline
is more complicated than generally assumed: for the investigated parameters,
the N2H+ column density peaks at least 5 AU outside the CO snowline. Moreover,
the N2H+ emission can peak much further out, as far as ~50 AU beyond the
snowline. Hence, chemical modeling, as done here, is necessary to derive a CO
snowline location from N2H+ observations.

ambiguity when it comes to choosing a set of annihilation and creation
operators, choice that is equivalent to the determination of a vacuum state. In
highly symmetric situations, this ambiguity can be removed by asking vacuum
invariance under the symmetries of the system. Similarly, in stationary
backgrounds, one can demand time-translation invariance plus positivity of the
energy. However, in more general situations, additional criteria are needed.
For the case of free (test) fields minimally coupled to a homogeneous and
isotropic cosmology, it has been proven that the ambiguity is resolved by
introducing the criterion of unitary implementability of the quantum dynamics,
as an endomorphism in Fock space. This condition determines a specific
separation of the time dependence of the field, so that this splits into a very
precise background dependence and a genuine quantum evolution. Furthermore,
together with the condition of vacuum invariance under the spatial Killing
symmetries, unitarity of the dynamics selects a unique Fock representation for
the canonical commutation relations, up to unitary equivalence. In this work,
we generalize these results to anisotropic spacetimes with shear, which are
therefore not conformally symmetric, by considering the case of a free scalar
field in a Bianchi I cosmology.

devices within the Fresnel (near-zone) region. In this context, the dynamic
aperture resembles a reconfigurable lens capable of focusing power to a
well-defined spot, whose dimension can be related to a point spread function
(PSF). Near-zone focusing can be achieved by generating different amplitude or
phase profiles over the aperture, which can be realized using traditional
architectures, such as phased arrays. Alternatively, metasurface guided-wave
apertures can achieve dynamic focusing, with potentially lower cost
implementations. We present an initial tradeoff analysis of the near-zone WPT
concept, relating key parameters such as spot size, aperture size, wavelength,
focal distance, and availability of sources. We find that approximate design
formulas derived from the Gaussian optics approximation provide useful
estimates of system performance, including transfer efficiency and coverage
volume. The accuracy of these formulas is confirmed using numerical

and a slightly asymmetric PWN suggesting possible jet structures. PSR
J0855-4644 is a pulsar with one of the highest \dot{E}/d^{2} from which no GeV
\gamma-ray pulsations have been detected. Methods: With a dedicated Chandra
observation, we perform detailed spatial modelling to constrain the geometry of
the PWN, in particular the pulsar's line of sight \zeta_{\rm PSR}. We also
perform geometric radio and \gamma-ray light curve modelling to further
constrain \zeta_{\rm PSR} and the magnetic obliquity \alpha. Results: The
observation reveals that the compact XMM source, thought to be the X-ray
pulsar, can be further resolved into a point source surrounded by an elongated
axisymmetric nebula with a longitudinal extent of 10"". The pulsar flux
represents only \sim 1\% of the XMM compact source and its spectrum is well
described by a blackbody of temperature kT=0.2 keV while the surrounding nebula
has a much harder spectrum (\Gamma=1.1 for a power-law model). Assuming the
origin of the extended emission is from a double torus yields \zeta_{\rm
PSR}=32.5\dg \pm 4.3\dg. Independent constraints from geometric light curve
modelling yield \alpha\lesssim55\dg and \zeta\lesssim55\dg, and
10\dg\lesssim|\zeta-\alpha|\lesssim30\dg. A \chi^2 fit to the radio light curve
yields a best fit at (\alpha,\zeta_{\rm PSR}) = (22\dg, 8\dg), with an
alternative fit at (\alpha,\zeta_{\rm PSR}) = (9\dg, 25\dg) within 3\sigma.
Such a geometry would explain, in the standard caustic pulsar model picture,
the radio-loud and \gamma-ray-quiet behaviour of this high \dot{E}/d^{2}
pulsar.

represent an innovative generation of circuit elements whose properties depend
on the state and history of the system. The hysteretic behavior of one of their
constituent variables, under the effect of an external time-dependent
perturbation, is their distinctive fingerprint. In turn, this feature endows
them with the ability to both store and process information on the same
physical location, a property that is expected to benefit many applications
ranging from unconventional computing to adaptive electronics to robotics, to
name just a few. For all these types of applications, it is important to find
appropriate memelements that combine a wide range of memory states (multi-state
memory), long memory retention times, and protection against unavoidable noise.
Although several physical systems belong to the general class of memelements,
few of them combine all of these important physical features in a single
component. Her we demonstrate theoretically a superconducting memory structure
based on solitonic long Josephson junctions (LJJs). We show that the Josephson
critical current of the junction behaves hysteretically as an external magnetic
field is properly swept. According to the hysteretic path displayed by the
critical current, a LJJ can be used as a multi-state memory, with a
controllable number of available states. In addition, since solitons are at the
core of its operation, this system provides an intrinsic topological protection
against external perturbations. Solitonic Josephson-based memelements may find
applications as memories, and in other emerging areas such as memcomputing,
i.e., computing directly in/by the memory.

However, the disintermediated access to contents does not guarantee quality of

to play a pivotal role in content consumption and information spreading. Users
tend to select information adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to
ignore dissenting information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized
groups -- i.e., echo chambers -- where the interaction with like-minded people
might even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption
around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive analysis

Furthermore, to better characterize inner group dynamics, we introduce a new

As an example, a new convex optimization problem for semi-supervised

number of known labels is small. Our formulation resembles a Least Squares SVM

transfer to fresh Si/SiO2 there is a ~50 meV shift of the ground state exciton
to higher emission energy in both photoluminescence emission and optical
reflection. This shift is indicative of a reduction in tensile strain by
~0.25%. Additionally, the excitonic state in x-WS2 is easily modulated between
neutral and charged exciton by exposure to moderate laser power, while such
optical control is absent in as-WS2 for all growth substrates investigated.
Finally, we observe dramatically different laser power-dependent behavior for

function-based representation of the Markov decision process (MDP) to
efficiently calculate the optimal policy. In the proposed framework, a global
plan that compressively takes into account the long time/length-scale state
transition is first obtained by approximately solving an MDP whose desirability
function is represented by coarse scale bases in the hierarchical abstraction.
Then, a detailed local plan is computed by solving an MDP that considers
wavelet bases associated with a focused region of the state space, guided by
the global plan. The resulting multiscale plan is utilized to finally compute a
continuous-time optimal control policy within a receding horizon
implementation. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the

facet-facet impact, the mutual contact surface area does not expand due to the
large facet surface, and this in turn leads to a non-Hertz impact force, n <

moderate sacrifices of individual utility lead to significant travel time
savings. Specifically, the results show that under full compliance rate, travel
delay fell by 52% at a cost of 31% less satisfaction. Under 60% compliance
rate, 41% travel delay is saved with a 17% reduction in satisfaction. This
paper highlights the effectiveness of the synergy among collective behaviors in
increasing system efficiency.

understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally
multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which
added together produce the final product [1]. At runtime, many of these terms
are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the
zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers
calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, PRA
calculates only the non-zero terms using a) on-the-fly conversion of the
multiplicator representation into an explicit list of powers of two, and b)
hybrid bit-parallel multplicand/bit-serial multiplicator processing units. PRA
exploits two sources of ineffectual computations: 1) the aforementioned zero

multiplicator representation, and 2) the excess in the representation precision
used for both multiplicants and multiplicators, e.g., [2]. Measurements
demonstrate that for the convolutional layers, a straightforward variant of PRA
improves performance by 2.6x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator [3] and by
1.4x over STR [4]. Similarly, PRA improves energy efficiency by 28% and 10% on

the same model on a honeycomb does not show any anisotropy or intermediate
states, but a single continuous phase transition between free and totally
congested flow, a transition that can be completely characterized by the tools
of classical percolation. Although the transition occurs at a lower density
than for the conventional BML, simple modifications, like randomly stopping the
cars with a very small probability or increasing the traffic light periods,
drives the model to perform better on honeycomb lattices. As traffic lights and
disordered perturbations are inherent to real traffic, these results question
the actual role of the square grid-like designs and suggests the honeycombs as
an interesting alternative for urban planning in real cities.

superheavy nuclei within the ambit of axially deformed relativistic mean-field
framework with NL$3^{*}$ parametrization and calculate the total binding
energies, radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, separation energies, density
distributions. We also investigate the phenomenon of shape coexistence by
performing the calculations for prolate, oblate and spherical configurations.
For clear presentation of nucleon distributions, the two-dimensional contour
representation of individual nucleon density and total matter density has been
made. Further, a competition between possible decay modes such as
$\alpha$-decay, $\beta$-decay and spontaneous fission of the isotopic chain of
superheavy nuclei with $Z=132$ within the range 312 $\le$ A $\le$ 392 and 318
$\le$ A $\le$ 398 for $Z=138$ is systematically analyzed within self-consistent
relativistic mean field model. From our analysis, we inferred that the
$\alpha$-decay and spontaneous fission are the principal modes of decay in
majority of the isotopes of superheavy nuclei under investigation apart from
$\beta$ decay as dominant mode of decay in $^{318-322}138$ isotopes.

results for the freezing temperature of the homopolymer chain as a function of
the range of the non-bonded interaction. We find that the previously reported
forward-flux sampling (FFS) and brute-force (BF) simulation results are in
agreement with the revised Wang-Landau (WL) calculations. This confirms the
utility of FFS for computing crystallisation rates in systems of this kind.

consisting in an algebraic fiber bundle, that is, a base structure which is a
free Abelian group together with fibers which are one dimensional vector
spaces, all of them bound by algebraic restrictions. Subspaces, tensor product
and quotient spaces are considered as well as homomorphisms to end with a
classification theorem of these structures. The new structure provides an
axiomatic foundation for quantity calculus and gives complete justification
within its framework of the way that quantity calculus is actually performed.
It is hoped that this exposition helps to clarify the role of the interviening
concepts of quantity, quantity value, quantity dimension and their relation
with a system of units, particularly, the SI.

realized in terms of electric networks. The isomorphism that connects in a
univocal way both dynamical systems was applied to the case of neutral mesons,
kaons in particular, and the class of electric networks univocally related to
the quantum system was analyzed. Moreover, under $CPT$ invariance, the relevant
$\epsilon$ parameter that measures $CP$ violation in the kaon system is
reinterpreted in terms of network parameters. All these results were explicitly
shown by means of both a numerical simulation of the implied networks and by
constructing the corresponding circuits.
