face-centered cubic lattice with small dipolar interaction in which the
next-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling dominates over the nearest-neighbor
one. It is well known that a collinear magnetic structure which contains (111)
ferromagnetic planes arranged antiferromagnetically along one of the space
diagonals of the cube is stabilized in this model via order-by-disorder
mechanism. On the mean-field level, the dipolar interaction forces spins to lie
within (111) planes. By considering 1/S - corrections to the ground state
energy, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations lead to an anisotropy within
(111) planes favoring three equivalent directions for the staggered
magnetization (e.g., $[11\overline{2}]$, $[1\overline{2}1]$, and
$[\overline{2}11]$ directions for (111) plane). Such in-plane anisotropy was
obtained experimentally in related materials MnO, $\alpha$-MnS, $\alpha$-MnSe,
EuTe, and EuSe. We find that the order-by-disorder mechanism can contribute
significantly to the value of the in-plane anisotropy in EuTe. Magnon spectrum
is also derived in the first order in 1/S.

statistical misspecification perspective. It is argued that the reversal of
statistical associations is sometimes spurious, stemming from invalid
probabilistic assumptions imposed on the data. The concept of statistical
misspecification is used to formalize the vague term `spurious results' as
`statistically untrustworthy' inference results. This perspective sheds new
light on the paradox by distingusing between statistically trustworthy vs.
untrustworthy association reversals. It turns out that in both cases there is
nothing counterintuitive to explain or account for. This perspective is also
used to revisit the causal `resolution' of the paradox in an attempt to
delineate the modeling and inference issues raised by the statistical
misspecification perspective. The main arguments are illustrated using both
actual and hypothetical data from the literature, including Yule's
""nonsense-correlations"" and the Berkeley admissions study.

point of view only in 2003. Since then many approaches were considered when it
came to the language describing the relationship between the source and the
target schema. These approaches focus on what it makes a target instance a
""good"" solution for data-exchange. In this paper we propose the inference-based
semantics that solves many certain-answer anomalies existing in current
data-exchange semantics. To this we introduce a new mapping language between
the source and the target schema based on annotated bidirectional dependencies
(abd) and, consequently define the semantics for this new language. It is shown
that the ABD-semantics can properly represent the inference-based semantics,
for any source-to-target mappings. We discovered three dichotomy results under
the new semantics for solution-existence, solution-check and UCQ evaluation
problems. These results rely on two factors describing the annotation used in
the mappings (density and cardinality). Finally we also investigate the
certain-answers evaluation problem under ABD-semantics and discover many
tractable classes for non-UCQ queries even for a subclass of CQ with negation.

13CO line data to trace an expanding shell surrounding the W-R star containing
about five condensations within the molecular cloud associated with the bubble.
The W-R star is associated with a powerful stellar wind having a mechanical
luminosity of ~4 x 10^37 ergs/s. A deviation of the H-band starlight mean
polarization angles around the bubble has also been traced, indicating the
impact of stellar wind on the surroundings. The Herschel temperature map shows
a temperature range of ~18 - 24 K toward the five molecular condensations. The
photometric analysis reveals that these condensations are associated with the
identified clusters of young stellar objects, revealing ongoing SF process. The
densest among these five condensations (peak N(H_2) ~9.2 x 10^22 cm^-2 and A_V
~ 98 mag) is associated with a 6.7 GHz methanol maser, an infrared dark cloud,
and the CO outflow, tracing active massive SF within it. At least five compact
radio sources (crss) are physically linked with the edges of the bubble and
each of them is consistent with the radio spectral class of a B0V - B0.5V type

Myr) and a typical age of WN7 W-R star (~4 Myr) indicate that the SF activities
around the bubble are influenced by the feedback of the W-R star.

when the penalty parameter for the estimator is chosen using $K$-fold
cross-validation. Our bounds imply that the cross-validated Lasso estimator has
nearly optimal rates of convergence in the prediction, $L^2$, and $L^1$ norms.
For example, we show that in the model with the Gaussian noise and under fairly
general assumptions on the candidate set of values of the penalty parameter,
the estimation error of the cross-validated Lasso estimator converges to zero
in the prediction norm with the $\sqrt{s\log p / n}\times \sqrt{\log(p n)}$
rate, where $n$ is the sample size of available data, $p$ is the number of
covariates, and $s$ is the number of non-zero coefficients in the model. Thus,
the cross-validated Lasso estimator achieves the fastest possible rate of
convergence in the prediction norm up to a small logarithmic factor
$\sqrt{\log(p n)}$, and similar conclusions apply for the convergence rate both
in $L^2$ and in $L^1$ norms. Importantly, our results cover the case when $p$

scenario and compare its stability condition with the existing ADMM method in
the round-robin scheme. An asynchronous and momentum variant of the EASGD
method is applied to train deep convolutional neural networks for image
classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Our approach accelerates the
training and furthermore achieves better test accuracy. It also requires a much
smaller amount of communication than other common baseline approaches such as
the DOWNPOUR method.
  We then investigate the limit in speedup of the initial and the asymptotic
phase of the mini-batch SGD, the momentum SGD, and the EASGD methods. We find
that the spread of the input data distribution has a big impact on their
initial convergence rate and stability region. We also find a surprising
connection between the momentum SGD and the EASGD method with a negative moving
average rate. A non-convex case is also studied to understand when EASGD can
get trapped by a saddle point.
  Finally, we scale up the EASGD method by using a tree structured network
topology. We show empirically its advantage and challenge. We also establish a
connection between the EASGD and the DOWNPOUR method with the classical Jacobi

The microwave brightness in the south-polar region has increased to a level

north is a direct consequence of the arrival of poleward surges of opposite
polarity from the active region belt. We also find that multiple
rush-to-the-pole episodes were indicated by the prominence eruption locations
that lined up at the boundary between opposite polarity surges. The
high-latitude prominence eruptions occurred in the boundary between the
incumbent polar flux and the insurgent flux of opposite polarity.

managing visitors' flow between spaces, a detailed analysis of the visitor's
movement is required to fully realize and apply a proper solution to the
problem. This paper analyzes the visitor's sequential movements, the spatial
layout, and the relationship between them in large-scale art museums - Louvre
Museum - using anonymized data collected through noninvasive Bluetooth sensors.
This enables us to unveil some features of visitor's behavior and spatial
impact that shed some light on the mechanism of the museum overcrowding. The
analysis reveals that the visiting style of short and long stay visitors are
not as significantly different as one could expect. Both types of visitors tend
to visit a similar number of key locations in the museum while the longer stay
type visitors just tend to do so more extensively. In addition, we reveal that
some ways of exploring the museum appear frequently for both types of visitors,
although long stay type visitors might be expected to diversify much more given
the greater time spent in the museum. We suggest that these
similarities/dissimilarities make for an uneven distribution of the quantity of
visitors in the museum space. The findings increase the understanding of the
unknown behaviors of visitors, which is key to improve the museum's environment
and visiting experience.

in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis
(PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greaterthan-one rule, multiple average
partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes
as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple
structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of
dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional
techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called
exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with
the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is
verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify
communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known
factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number
of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000
and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70),
resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were
simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to
parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to KaiserGuttman rule in a number of
situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the
only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the
four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an
accuracy of 100% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was
used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare
its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.

high-throughput genotyping have motivated studies examining the influence of
genetic variation on brain structure. Wang et al. (Bioinformatics, 2012) have
developed an approach for the analysis of imaging genomic studies using
penalized multi-task regression with regularization based on a novel group
$l_{2,1}$-norm penalty which encourages structured sparsity at both the gene
level and SNP level. While incorporating a number of useful features, the
proposed method only furnishes a point estimate of the regression coefficients;
techniques for conducting statistical inference are not provided. A new
Bayesian method is proposed here to overcome this limitation.
  Results: We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modeling formulation where the
posterior mode corresponds to the estimator proposed by Wang et al.
(Bioinformatics, 2012), and an approach that allows for full posterior
inference including the construction of interval estimates for the regression
parameters. We show that the proposed hierarchical model can be expressed as a
three-level Gaussian scale mixture and this representation facilitates the use
of a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior simulation. Simulation studies
demonstrate that the interval estimates obtained using our approach achieve
adequate coverage probabilities that outperform those obtained from the
nonparametric bootstrap. Our proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of
neuroimaging and genetic data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and this analysis of the ADNI cohort
demonstrates clearly the value added of incorporating interval estimation
beyond only point estimation when relating SNPs to brain imaging
endophenotypes.

disks or cylinders, which keep track of the number of loops separating the
marked point from the boundary (for disks), or the two boundaries (for
cylinders). For the general O(n) loop model, we show that these generating
series satisfy functional relations obtained by a modification of those
satisfied by the unrefined generating series. In a more specific O(n) model
where loops cross only triangles and have a bending energy, we explicitly
compute the refined generating series. We analyse their non generic critical
behavior in the dense and dilute phases, and obtain the large deviations
function of the nesting distribution, which is expected to be universal. Using
the framework of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), we show that a rigorous
functional KPZ relation can be applied to the multifractal spectrum of extreme
nesting in the conformal loop ensemble (CLE) in the Euclidean unit disk, as
obtained by Miller, Watson and Wilson, or to its natural generalisation to the
Riemann sphere. It allows us to recover the large deviations results obtained
for the critical O(n) random planar map models. This offers, at the refined
level of large deviations theory, a rigorous check of the fundamental fact that
the universal scaling limits of random planar map models as weighted by
partition functions of critical statistical models are given by LQG random
surfaces decorated by independent CLEs.

achieved by using in-plane variations of the band gap or the average potential
in lateral quantum structures. In the atomic configurations with hexagonal
symmetry, this approach makes it possible to tailor the valleytronic properties
for potential device applications. In this work, we present a multi-band theory
to calculate the valley-dependent electron transport in graphene-based lateral
quantum structures. As an example, we consider the structures with a single
interface that exhibits an energy gap or potential discontinuity. The
theoretical formalism proceeds within the tight-binding description, by first
deriving the local bulk complex band structures in the regions of a constant
gap or potential and, next, joining the local wave functions across the
interface via a cell-averaged current operator to ensure the current
continuity. The theory is applied to the study of electron reflection off and
transmission through an interface. Both reflection and transmission are found
to exhibit valley-contrast behavior that can be used to generate
valley-polarized electron sources. The results vary with the type of
interfaces, as well as between monolayer and bilayer graphene based structures.
In the monolayer case, the valley contrast originates from the band warping and
only becomes sizable for incident carriers of high energy; whereas in
AB-stacked bilayer graphene, the vertical interlayer coupling emerges as an
additional important cause for valley contrast, and the favorable carrier
energy is also found to be drastically lower. Our numerical results clearly
demonstrate the propitious valleytronic properties of bilayer graphene
structures.

impacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well
understood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random
bursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.
Formulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are
derived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and
stochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions
from bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules
between daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:
cell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty
expression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We
investigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell
cycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a
zero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring
just before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed
mean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of
partitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide
examples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell
cycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle
decisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression.

magnetospheres of non-rotating neutron stars, which are of interest in the
modelling of magnetar properties and evolution. In our models the magnetic
field smoothly matches to a current-free (vacuum) solution at some large
external radius, and they are specifically built to avoid pathological surface
currents at any of the interfaces. By exploring a large range of parameters, we
find a few remarkable general trends. We find that the total dipolar moment can
be increased by up to $40\%$ with respect to a vacuum model with the same
surface magnetic field, due to the contribution of magnetospheric currents to
the global magnetic field. Thus, estimates of the surface magnetic field based
on the large-scale dipolar braking torque are slightly overestimating the
surface value by the same amount. Consistently, there is a moderate increase in
the total energy of the model with respect to the vacuum solution of up to
$25\%$, which would be the available energy budget in the event of a fast,
global magnetospheric reorganization commonly associated with magnetar flares.
We have also found the interesting result of the existence of a critical twist
($\varphi_{\rm max} \lesssim 1.5$ rad), beyond which we cannot find any more
numerical solutions. Combining the models considered in this paper with the
evolution of the interior of neutron stars will allow us to study the influence
of the magnetosphere on the long-term magnetic, thermal, and rotational
evolution.

population from Kepler data, based on the assumption that the frequency of
exoplanets can be represented by a smooth function of planet radius and period.
The method is applied to the two most recent data releases from the Kepler
project, q1-16 and q1-17, over the range of periods 0.5 to 512 days, and radii
0.5 to 16 Earth radii. Both of these releases have known biases, with the first
believed to contain excess false positives, and the second excess false
negatives, so any analysis of them should be viewed with caution. We apply the
new method of population estimation to these releases, treating them like
practice data sets. With this method, we tentatively find that the average
number of planets per star would be about $5.7\pm0.8$ for F stars, $5.0\pm0.2$
for G stars, $4.0\pm0.3$ for K stars, and $6.5\pm1.7$ for M stars, indicating a
decreasing trend with FGK spectral type, but an upward jump for M stars. A
second conclusion is that the number of planets per G star, per natural log
unit of period (days) and radii (Earths) at the period and radius of the Earth
around the Sun, is about $\Gamma_\oplus(G) = 1.1\pm 0.1$. A related parameter,
$\eta_{\oplus}$, which in addition depends on the range of period and radius
considered, is found to be $\eta_{\oplus}(G) \simeq 1.0 \pm 0.1 $. More
definitive conclusions, and validation of these preliminary values, await the

instability, which resembles Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations of solitons in
Hamiltonian systems even though the present system is dissipative and
non-Hamiltonian. The most important numerical finding is that, eigenvalues of

non-PT-symmetric systems, and it has far-reaching consequences on the stability

more visual properties for comprehensively describing the objects of interest.
So a two-stage learning framework consisting of property derivation and fusion
is constructed. Here the properties can be derived either from the provided
color/depth or their pairs (e.g. the geometry contour adopted in this paper).
Secondly, we explore the fusion method of different properties in feature
learning, which is boiled down to, under the CNN model, from which layer the
properties should be fused together. The analysis shows that different semantic
properties should be learned separately and combined before passing into the
final classifier. Actually, such a detection way is in accordance with the

induces the inertial wave and causes the large-scale structure to inhibit the

imposed field also causes the large-scale structure but facilitates the flow
decay in the first stage because of the energy conversion from flow to magnetic
field. Magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ is important for the dynamics of the MHD
flow, namely a high $Rm$ induces the Alfv\'en wave but a low $Rm$ cannot. In
the rotating MHD flow, slower rotation tends to convert more kinetic energy to
magnetic energy. The orientation between the rotational and magnetic axes is
important for the dynamics of the rotating MHD flow, namely the energy
conversion is more efficient and the stronger wave is induced when the two axes
are not parallel than when they are parallel.

labeled samples needed to train a classifier in a parametric Bayesian setting.
We derive bounds on the average $L_p$ distance between the learned classifier
and the true maximum a posteriori classifier, which are well-established
surrogates for the excess classification error due to imperfect learning. We
provide lower and upper bounds on the rate-distortion function, using $L_p$
loss as the distortion measure, of a maximum a priori classifier in terms of
the differential entropy of the posterior distribution and a quantity called
the interpolation dimension, which characterizes the complexity of the
parametric distribution family. In addition to expressing the information
content of a classifier in terms of lossy compression, the rate-distortion
function also expresses the minimum number of bits a learning machine needs to
extract from training data to learn a classifier to within a specified $L_p$
tolerance. We use results from universal source coding to express the
information content in the training data in terms of the Fisher information of
the parametric family and the number of training samples available. The result
is a framework for computing lower bounds on the Bayes $L_p$ risk. This
framework complements the well-known probably approximately correct (PAC)
framework, which provides minimax risk bounds involving the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension or Rademacher complexity. Whereas the PAC framework provides upper
bounds the risk for the worst-case data distribution, the proposed
rate-distortion framework lower bounds the risk averaged over the data
distribution. We evaluate the bounds for a variety of data models, including
categorical, multinomial, and Gaussian models. In each case the bounds are
provably tight orderwise, and in two cases we prove that the bounds are tight
up to multiplicative constants.

radio morphology at large scale, FR~I or FR~II. However, the diversity of
blazars is such that these classes seem insufficient to chart the specific
properties of each source. We propose to classify a wide sample of blazars
following the kinematic features of their radio jets seen in very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI). For this purpose we use public data from the MOJAVE
collaboration in which we select a sample of blazars with known redshift and
sufficient monitoring to constrain apparent velocities. We selected 161 blazars
from a sample of 200 sources. We identify three distinct classes of VLBI jets
depending on radio knot kinematics: class I with quasi-stationary knots, class
II with knots in relativistic motion from the radio core, and class I/II,
intermediate, showing quasi-stationary knots at the jet base and relativistic
motions downstream. A notable result is the good overlap of this kinematic
classification with the usual spectral classification; class I corresponds to
HBLs, class II to FSRQs, and class I/II to IBLs/LBLs. We deepen this study by
characterizing the physical parameters of jets from VLBI radio data. Hence we
focus on the singular case of the class I/II by the study of the blazar BL Lac
itself. Finally we show how the interpretation that radio knots are

application of the Chi^2 statistics of the full database, of its 4,838 data

accounted for by the (linear regime) velocity power spectrum. The bulk velocity
constitutes a highly compressed representation of the data which filters out
the small scales non-linear modes. Hence the statistics of the bulk flow
provides an efficient tool for assessing the GoF of the data given a model. The
particular approach introduced here is to use the (spherical top-hat window)
bulk velocity extracted from the Wiener filter reconstruction of the 3D
velocity field as a linear low pass filtered highly compressed representation
of the CF2 data. An ensemble 2250 random linear realizations of the WMAP/LCDM

find that the CF2 data is consistent with the WMAP/LCDM model to better than
the 2 sigma confidence limits. This provides a further validation that the CF2

paper, we present IncVoronoi: a novel system that can provide zero-calibration
accurate RF-based indoor localization that works in realistic environments. The
basic idea is that the relative relation between the received signal strength
from two APs at a certain location reflects the relative distance from this
location to the respective APs. Building on this, IncVoronoi incrementally
reduces the user ambiguity region based on refining the Voronoi tessellation of
the area of interest. IncVoronoi also includes a number of modules to
efficiently run in realtime as well as to handle practical deployment issues
including the noisy wireless environment, obstacles in the environment,
heterogeneous devices hardware, and smart APs. We have deployed IncVoronoi on
different Android phones using the iBeacons technology in a university campus.
Evaluation of IncVoronoi with a side-by-side comparison with traditional
fingerprinting techniques shows that it can achieve a consistent median
accuracy of 2.8m under different scenarios with a low beacon density of one
beacon every 44m2. Compared to fingerprinting techniques, whose accuracy
degrades by at least 156%, this accuracy comes with no training overhead and is
robust to the different user devices, different transmit powers, and over
temporal changes in the environment. This highlights the promise of IncVoronoi
as a next generation indoor localization system.

static networks, while most of real world networks are dynamic and evolve over

without any prior knowledge about the number of communities is still an
interesting open research problem. In this paper, we present an overlapping
community detection method for dynamic networks called Dynamic Bayesian
Overlapping Community Detector (DBOCD). DBOCD assumes that in every snapshot of
network, overlapping parts of communities are dense areas and utilizes link
communities instead of common node communities. Using Recurrent Chinese
Restaurant Process and community structure of the network in the last snapshot,
DBOCD simultaneously extracts the number of communities and soft community
memberships of nodes while maintaining the consistency of communities over
time. We evaluated DBOCD on both synthetic and real dynamic data-sets to assess
its ability to find overlapping communities in different types of network
evolution. The results show that DBOCD outperforms the recent state of the art
dynamic community detection methods.

of each pixel by using the trained CNN model. Secondly, we present a ground
control points selection scheme according to the maximum matching confidence of
each pixel. Finally, the selected GCPs are used to refine the matching costs,
and we apply the new matching costs to perform optimization with semi-global

the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of disparity maps.

sets of dependencies between data symbols and redundant symbols. The most
common arrangement is to have $k$ data symbols and $h$ redundant symbols (that
each depends on all data symbols) be partitioned into a number of disjoint
groups, where for each group one allocates an additional (local) redundant
symbol storing the parity of all symbols in the group. A code as above is
maximally recoverable, if it corrects all erasure patterns that are information
theoretically correctable given the dependency constraints. A slightly weaker
guarantee is provided by SD codes.
  One key consideration in the design of MR and SD codes is the size of the
finite field underlying the code as using small finite fields facilitates
encoding and decoding operations. In this paper we present new explicit
constructions of SD and MR codes over small finite fields.

We report on the preeruptive phase of the homologous feature as well as the
kinematics and the morphology of a forth from a series of prominence eruptions
that is critical in defining the nature of the previous consecutive eruptions.
The evolution of the overlying coronal field during homologous eruptions is
discussed and a new observational criterion for homologous eruptions is
provided. We find a distinctive sequence of three activation periods each of
them containing preeruptive precursors such as a brightening and enlarging of
the prominence body followed by small surge- like ejections from its southern
end observed in the radio 17 GHz. We analyse a fourth eruption that clearly
indicates a full reformation of the prominence after the third eruption. The
fourth eruption although occurring 11 hrs later has an identical morphology,
the same angle of propagation with respect to the radial direction, as well as
similar kinematic evolution as the previous three eruptions. We find an
important feature of the homologous eruptive prominence sequence that is the
maximum height increase of each consecutive eruption. The present analysis
establishes that all four eruptions observed in H{\alpha} are of confined type
with the third eruption undergoing a thermal disappearance during its eruptive
phase. We suggest that the observation of the same direction of the magnetic
flux rope (MFR) ejections can be consider as an additional observational
criterion for MFR homology. This observational indication for homologous
eruptions is important, especially in the case of events of typical or poorly
distinguishable morphology of eruptive solar phenomena.

states lead to more complicated spectral patterns and, moreover, often appear
as a manifold of closely lying electronic states, leading to perturbations with
even larger complexity. This is especially true when at least one of the atoms

using approaches based on perturbation theory, with semi-empirical parameters
determined by fitting to spectral data.
  Recently the needs of two rather diverse scientific areas have driven the

with block storage as well as that with dynamic memory allocation. For example,
we can show that dynamic variable allocation can be replaced with
block-allocated variables exactly when the term involved (open or closed) is of
base type and that block-allocated storage can be replaced with purely
functional computation when types of order two are involved. To illustrate the
restrictive nature of block structure further, we prove a decidability result
for a finitary fragment of call-by-value Idealized Algol for which it is known
that allowing for dynamic memory allocation leads to undecidability.

continuous linear measurement, in which the detector is coupled to the system
of interest linearly and continuously in time. One key aspect involved is the
quantum noise of the detector, arising from quantum fluctuations in the
detector input and output. It determines how fast we acquire information about
the system and also influences the system evolution in terms of measurement
backaction. We therefore often categorize it as the so-called imprecision noise
and quantum backaction noise. There is a general Heisenberg-like uncertainty
relation that constrains the magnitude of and the correlation between these two
types of quantum noise. The main result of this paper is to show that, when the
detector becomes ideal, i.e., at the quantum limit with minimum uncertainty,
not only does the uncertainty relation takes the equal sign as expected, but
also there are two new equalities. This general result is illustrated by using
the typical cavity QED setup with the system being either a qubit or a
mechanical oscillator. Particularly, the dispersive readout of a qubit state,
and the measurement of mechanical motional sideband asymmetry are considered.

understanding the practical impact that errorfully observed vertex

establish a duality between the loss of mutual information due to an errorfully

recover the true correspondence across graphs. In the process, we establish a
phase transition for graph matchability in terms of the correlation across

reaction model dependence in the study of halo nuclei. Purpose: Originally, it
was developed for higher energies but given the potential interest in applying
the method at lower energy, in this work we explore its validity at 20
MeV/nucleon. Method: The ratio method takes the ratio of the breakup angular
distribution and the summed angular distribution (which includes elastic,
inelastic and breakup) and uses this observable to constrain the features of
the original halo wave function. In this work we use the Continuum Discretized
Coupled Channel method and the Coulomb-corrected Dynamical Eikonal
Approximation for the study. Results: We study the reactions of 11Be on 12C,
40Ca and 208Pb at 20 MeV/nucleon. We compare the various theoretical
descriptions and explore the dependence of our result on the core-target
interaction. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the ratio method is valid
at these lower beam energies.

where the transmitter can pre-store information even before learning the
receivers' requests. We mostly focus on packet-erasure broadcast networks with
two disjoint sets of receivers: a set of weak receivers with all-equal erasure
probabilities and equal cache sizes and a set of strong receivers with
all-equal erasure probabilities and no cache memories. We present lower and
upper bounds on the capacity-memory tradeoff of this network. The lower bound
is achieved by a new joint cache-channel coding idea and significantly improves
on schemes that are based on separate cache-channel coding. We discuss how this
coding idea could be extended to more general discrete memoryless broadcast
channels and to unequal cache sizes. Our upper bound holds for all
stochastically degraded broadcast channels.
  For the described packet-erasure broadcast network, our lower and upper
bounds are tight when there is a single weak receiver (and any number of strong
receivers) and the cache memory size does not exceed a given threshold. When
there are a single weak receiver, a single strong receiver, and two files, then
we can strengthen our upper and lower bounds so as they coincide over a wide
regime of cache sizes.
  Finally, we completely characterise the rate-memory tradeoff for general
discrete-memoryless broadcast channels with arbitrary cache memory sizes and
arbitrary (asymmetric) rates when all receivers always demand exactly the same

particle in the cage of its neighbours in dense liquids. The strength of their
influence is investigated by Molecular Dynamics simulations of a supercooled
liquid of fully-flexible trimers with semirigid or rigid bonds. The rattling in
the cage is investigated on different length scales. First, the rattling
anisotropy due to local order is characterized by two order parameters sensing
the monomers succeeding or failing to escape from the cage. Then, the
collective response of the surroundings excited by the monomer-monomer
collisions is considered. The collective response is initially restricted to
the nearest neighbours of the colliding particle by a Voronoi analysis
revealing elastic contributions. Then, the long-range excitation of the
farthest neighbours is scrutinised by searching spatially-extended correlations
between the simultaneous fast displacements of the caged particle and the
surroundings. It is found that the longitudinal component has stronger spatial
modulation than the transverse one with wavelength of about one particle
diameter, in close resemblance with experimental findings on colloids. It is
concluded that the cage rattling is largely affected by solid-like extended

of the success of this combination. The recent breakthrough made by AlphaGo,
which incorporates convolutional neural networks with bandit algorithms in
MCTS, also highlights the necessity of bandit algorithms in MCTS. However,
despite the various investigations carried out on MCTS, nearly all of them
still follow the paradigm of treating every node as an independent instance of
the MAB problem, and applying the same bandit algorithm and heuristics on every
node. As a result, this paradigm may leave some properties of the game tree
unexploited. In this work, we propose that max nodes and min nodes have
different concerns regarding their value estimation, and different bandit
algorithms should be applied accordingly. We develop the Asymmetric-MCTS
algorithm, which is an MCTS variant that applies a simple regret algorithm on
max nodes, and the UCB algorithm on min nodes. We will demonstrate the
performance of the Asymmetric-MCTS algorithm on the game of $9\times 9$ Go,
$9\times 9$ NoGo, and Othello.

$\epsilon(t)=\gamma t a^{-3}(t)$ to the form

all trajectories in the phase space and there are two repellers: the
Einstein-de Sitter universe and the de Sitter universe state dominating by the
diffusion effects. We distinguish in the phase space trajectories, which become

  Integrated Task and Motion Planning of Cooperative Multi-agent Systems","Submitted to Automatica",,,,"cs.RO cs.FL cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a hierarchical design framework to automatically synthesize
coordination schemes and control policies for cooperative multi-agent systems
to fulfill formal performance requirements, by associating a bottom-up reactive
motion controller with a top-down mission plan. On one hand, starting from a
global mission that is specified as a regular language over all the agents'
mission capabilities, a mission planning layer sits on the top of the proposed
framework, decomposing the global mission into local tasks that are in
consistency with each agent's individual capabilities, and compositionally
justifying whether the achievement of local tasks implies the satisfaction of
the global mission via an assume-guarantee paradigm. On the other hand,
bottom-up motion plans associated with each agent are synthesized corresponding
to the obtained local missions by composing basic motion primitives, which are
verified safe by differential dynamic logic (d$\mathcal{L}$), through a
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver that searches feasible solutions in
face of constraints imposed by local task requirements and the environment
description. It is shown that the proposed framework can handle dynamical
environments as the motion primitives possess reactive features, making the
motion plans adaptive to local environmental changes. Furthermore, on-line
mission reconfiguration can be triggered by the motion planning layer once no
feasible solutions can be found through the SMT solver. The effectiveness of
the overall design framework is validated by an automated warehouse case study.
