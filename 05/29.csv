significance of this tool for two different equity datasets. We also identify
an optimal region of parameters in terms of True Positive and False Positive

the temporal analysis indicates that our method is able to adapt to abrupt

  variability to population activity in V1",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Response variability, as measured by fluctuating responses upon repeated
performance of trials, is a major component of neural responses, and its
characterization is key to interpret high dimensional population recordings.
Response variability and covariability display predictable changes upon changes
in stimulus and cognitive or behavioral state, providing an opportunity to test
the predictive power of models of neural variability. Still, there is little
agreement on which model to use as a building block for population-level
analyses, and models of variability are often treated as a subject of choice.
We investigate two competing models, the Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model
assuming stochasticity at spike generation, and the Rectified Gaussian (RG)
model that traces variability back to membrane potential variance, to analyze
stimulus-dependent modulation of response statistics. Using a model of a pair
of neurons, we demonstrate that the two models predict similar single-cell
statistics. However, DSP and RG models have contradicting predictions on the
joint statistics of spiking responses. In order to test the models against
data, we build a population model to simulate stimulus change-related
modulations in response statistics. We use unit recordings from the primary
visual cortex of monkeys to show that while model predictions for variance are
qualitatively similar to experimental data, only the RG model's predictions are
compatible with joint statistics. These results suggest that models using
Poisson-like variability might fail to capture important properties of response
statistics. We argue that membrane potential-level modelling of stochasticity
provides an efficient strategy to model correlations.

persisting on a perfect periodic boundary condition, we can get a so-called
a-cycle problem that has not been treated seriously so far (Lieb et al., 1961

surprising but exact result in this respect. We find the odevity of the number
of lattice sites, $N$, in the a-cycle problem plays an unexpected role even in
the thermodynamic limit, $N\rightarrow\infty$, due to the boundary constraint.
We pay a special attention to the system with $N(\in Odd)\rightarrow\infty$,
which is in contrast to the one with $N(\in Even)\rightarrow\infty$, because
the former suffers a ring frustration. As a new effect, we find the ring
frustration induces a low-energy gapless spectrum above the ground state. By
proving a theorem for a new type of Toeplitz determinant, we demonstrate that
the ground state in the gapless region exhibits a peculiar longitudinal
spin-spin correlation. The entangled nature of the ground state is also
disclosed by the evaluation of its entanglement entropy. At low temperatures,
new behavior of specific heat is predicted. We also propose an experimental
protocol for observing the new phenomenon due to the ring frustration.

feature spaces without any contextual clues or assumptions. This paper concerns
itself with one popular topological feature, which is the number of
$d-$dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti$-d$ number. The
persistence of the Betti numbers over various scales is encoded into a
persistence diagram (PD), which indicates the birth and death times of these
holes as scale varies. A common way to compare PDs is by a point-to-point
matching, which is given by the $n$-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawback
of this approach is the need to solve correspondence between points before
computing the distance; for $n$ points, the complexity grows according to
$\mathcal{O}($n$^3)$. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new framework
built on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs as 2D probability density
functions that are represented in the square-root framework on a Hilbert
Sphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive with closed form expressions
for common operations. The distance metric is 1) correspondence-free and also
2) independent of the number of points in the dataset. The complexity of
computing distance between PDs now grows according to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$, for a
$K \times K$ discretization of $[0,1]^2$. This also enables the use of existing
machinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such as
computing the mean, geodesics, classification etc. We report competitive
results with the Wasserstein metric, at a much lower computational load,
indicating the favorable properties of the proposed approach.

existence of the overall joint probability distributions in the underlying

relevant trichotomic observables, satisfying the locality condition and
yielding the measurable marginal probabilities. Such generalized Wigner

qutrit isotropic and singlet states using trichotomic observables defined by
six-port beam splitter as well as by the spin-$1$ component observables. The
efficacy of GWI is then probed in these cases by comparing the QM violation of
GWI with that obtained for the CGLMP inequality. This comparison is done by
incorporating white noise in the singlet and isotropic qutrit states. It is
found that for the six-port beam splitter observables, QM violation of GWI is
more robust than that of the CGLMP inequality for singlet qutrit states, while
for isotropic qutrit states, QM violation of the CGLMP inequality is more
robust. On the other hand, for the spin-$1$ component observables, QM violation

appearing in Kohn-Sham theory can be reduced to the fundamental domain

up to system sizes of 100 nm and good agreement is found with separate

industrialor commercial loads, or load serving entities, modeled as stochastic
dynamical systems. In each time period, they consume or supply electrical
energy, with the constraint that total generation equals consumption. Each
agent's utility is either the benefit accrued from consumption, or negative of
generation cost. The Independent System Operator has to maximize their sum, the
social welfare, without agents revealing their dynamic models or utilities. It
has to announce prices after interacting with agents via bids.
  If agents observe and know the laws of uncertainties affecting other agents,
then there is an iterative price and bid interaction that leads to the maximum
social welfare attainable if agents pooled their information.
  In the important case where agents are LQG systems not even knowing of the
existence of other agents, the bid and price iteration is dramatically simple,
exchanging time vectors of future prices and consumptions or generations at
each time step. State dependent bidding is not needed. This solution of the
decentralized stochastic control problem may be of economic importance in power
systems, and of broader interest in general equilibrium theory of economics for
stochastic dynamic agents.

interactions and main effects to a moderate scale by a new feature screening
approach, and then selects important interactions and main effects in the
reduced feature space using regularization methods. Compared to existing
approaches, our method screens interactions separately from main effects and
thus can be more effective in interaction screening. Under a fairly general
framework, we establish that for both interactions and main effects, the method
enjoys the sure screening property in screening and oracle inequalities in
selection. Our method and theoretical results are supported by several
simulation and real data examples.

origin of this apparently counter-intuitive phenomenon was traced to the nature

first the same model MT-kt attachment is subjected to external tension that
increases linearly with time until rupture occurs. In our {\it force-ramp}
experiments {\it in-silico}, the model displays the well known `mechanical

this new evidence, we have further strengthened the analogy between MT-kt
attachments and common ligand-receptor bonds in spite of the crucial
differences in their underlying physical mechanisms. We then extend the
formalism to model the stochastic kinetics of an attachment formed by a bundle
of multiple parallel microtubules with a single kt considering the effect of
rebinding under force-clamp and force-ramp conditions. From numerical studies
of the model we predict the trends of variation of the mean life time and mean
rupture force with the increasing number of MTs in the bundle. Both the mean
life time and the mean rupture force display nontrivial nonlinear dependence on

A nilspace is a compact space $X$ together with closed collections of cubes
$C^n(X)\subseteq X^{2^n}$, $n=1,2,\ldots$ satisfying some natural axioms.
Antol\'in Camarena and Szegedy proved that from these axioms it follows that
(certain) nilspaces are isomorphic (in a strong sense) to an inverse limit of
nilmanifolds. The aim of our project is to provide a new self-contained
treatment of this theory and give new applications to topological dynamics.
  This paper provides an introduction to the project from the point of view of
applications to higher order Fourier analysis. We define and explain the basic
definitions and constructions related to cubespaces and nilspaces and develop
the weak structure theory, which is the first stage of the proof of the main
structure theorem for nilspaces. Vaguely speaking, this asserts that a nilspace
can be built as a finite tower of extensions where each of the successive
fibers is a compact abelian group.
  We also make some modest innovations and extensions to this theory. In
particular, we consider a class of maps that we term fibrations, which are
essentially equivalent to what are termed fiber-surjective morphisms by
Anatol\'in Camarena and Szegedy, and we formulate and prove a relative analogue
of the weak structure theory alluded to above for these maps. These results
find applications elsewhere in the project.

explains the asymptotic tail behaviour of $M(\mathcal{T})$ under some

tail asymptotics of $M(\mathcal{T})$ for the class of Gaussian random fields
with variance and correlation functions being regularly varying at $t_0$. A
crucial novel element is the analysis of families of Gaussian random fields

usual techniques of integrable field theories. The charges associated to
two-solitons with a definite parity under space-reflection symmetry, i.e.
kink-kink (odd parity) and kink-antikink (even parity) scatterings with equal
and opposite velocities, split into two infinite towers of conserved and
asymptotically conserved charges. For two-solitons without definite parity
under space-reflection symmetry (kink-kink and kink-antikink scatterings with
unequal and opposite velocities) our numerical results show the existence of
the asymptotically conserved charges only. However, we show that in the
center-of-mass reference frame of the two solitons the parity symmetries and
their associated set of exactly conserved charges can be restored. Moreover,
the positive parity breather-like (kink-antikink bound state) solution exhibits
a tower of exactly conserved charges and a subset of charges which are periodic
in time. We back up our results with extensive numerical simulations which also
demonstrate the existence of long lived breather-like states in these models.
The time evolution has been simulated by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method

stable rotational period and gradual spin-down over a long timescale due to the
loss of radiation. Glitches refer to the events that suddenly increase the
rotational speed of a pulsar. The exact causes of glitches and the resulting
processes are not fully understood. It is generally believed that couplings
between the normal matter and the superfluid components, and the starquakes,
are the common causes of glitches. In this study, one famous glitching pulsar,
PSR~J2021+4026, is investigated. PSR~J2021+4026 is the first variable gamma-ray
pulsar observed by Fermi. From the gamma-ray observations, it is found that the
pulsar experienced a significant flux drop, an increase in the spin-down rate,
a change in the pulse profile and a shift in the spectral cut-off to a lower
energy, simultaneously around 2011 October 16. To explain these effects on the
high-energy emissions by the glitch of PSR~J2021+4026, we hypothesized the
glitch to be caused by the rearrangement of the surface magnetic field due to
the crustal plate tectonic activities on the pulsar which is triggered by a
starquake. In this glitch event, the inclination angle of the magnetic dipole
axis is slightly shifted. This proposition is then tested by numerical modeling
using a three-dimensional two-layer outer gap model. The simulation results
indicate that a modification of the inclination angle can affect the pulse
profile and the spectral properties, which can explain the observation changes
after the glitch.

challenges in the proposal: First, how to design a framework that aggregates
bandwidth from multiple edge networks? Second, how to make this framework
transparent to today's crowdsourced live streaming services? Third, how to
maximize the streaming quality for the whole system? We design a
multi-objective and deployable bandwidth aggregation system BASS to address
these challenges: (1) We propose an aggregation framework transparent to

Modulation (ESM), which was recently introduced by the present authors. The
basic idea of ESM is to convey information bits not only by the index(es) of
the active transmit antenna(s) as in conventional Spatial Modulation (SM), but
also by the types of the signal constellations used. The original ESM schemes
were designed with reference to single-stream SM and involved one or more
secondary modulations in addition to the primary modulation. Compared to
single-stream SM, they provided either higher throughput or improved
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the present paper, we focus on multi-stream SM
(MSM) and present three new ESM designs leading to increasing SNR gains when
they are operated at the same spectral efficiency. The secondary signal
constellations used in the first two designs are based on a single geometric
interpolation step in the signal constellation plane, while the third design
also makes use of additional constellations derived through a second
interpolation step. The new ESM signal designs are described for MIMO systems
with four transmit antennas two of which are active, but we also briefly
present extensions to higher numbers of antennas. Theoretical analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed designs provide a significant SNR
gain over MSM.

crucial in industrial design problems and this might be achieved through
reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) techniques. In this paper, we
propose a quantile-based approach to solve RBDO problems. We first transform
the safety constraints usually formulated as admissible probabilities of
failure into constraints on quantiles of the performance criteria. In this
formulation, the quantile level controls the degree of conservatism of the
design. Starting with the premise that industrial applications often involve
high-fidelity and time-consuming computational models, the proposed approach
makes use of Kriging surrogate models (a.k.a. Gaussian process modeling).
Thanks to the Kriging variance (a measure of the local accuracy of the
surrogate), we derive a procedure with two stages of enrichment of the design
of computer experiments (DoE) used to construct the surrogate model. The first
stage globally reduces the Kriging epistemic uncertainty and adds points in the
vicinity of the limit-state surfaces describing the system performance to be
attained. The second stage locally checks, and if necessary, improves the
accuracy of the quantiles estimated along the optimization iterations.
Applications to three analytical examples and to the optimal design of a car
body subsystem (minimal mass under mechanical safety constraints) show the
accuracy and the remarkable efficiency brought by the proposed procedure.

relationship between star formation rate and gas mass traced by dust continuum
emission was found for both Galactic clumps and the high redshift (z>1) star
forming galaxies (SFGs), indicating a constant gas depletion time of ~100 Myr
for molecular gas in both Galactic clumps and high z SFGs. However, low z
galaxies do not follow this relation and seem to have a longer global gas
depletion time. The correlations between total infrared luminosities (L_TIR)
and molecular line luminosities (L'_mol) of HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) are tight
and sublinear extending down to clumps with LTIR~10^{3} L_sun. These
correlations become linear when extended to external galaxies. A bimodal
behavior in the LTIR--L'mol correlations was found for clumps with different
dust temperature, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and sigmaline/sigmavir. Such
bimodal behavior may be due to evolutionary effects. The slopes of LTIR--L'mol
correlations become more shallow as clumps evolve. We compared our results with
lower J transition lines in wu et al. (2010). The correlations between clump
masses and line luminosities are close to linear for low effective excitation
density tracers but become sublinear for high effective excitation density
tracers for clumps with LTIR larger than LTIR~10^4.5 Lsun. High effective
excitation density tracers cannot linearly trace the total clump masses,
leading to a sublinear correlations for both Mclump-L'mol and LTIR-L'mol
relations.

phase slip among oscillators, resulting in synchronization failure. Thus, an
intermediate coupling range for synchronization exists, which becomes narrower
when the network is more heterogeneous. Analyses of two noisy oscillators
reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present
and coupling is strong. Therefore, the low synchronizability of heterogeneous

strength among oscillators with different degrees; oscillators with high
degrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak

for training linear predictors via minimizing regularized empirical risk. When
the number of examples ($n$) is much larger than the number of features ($d$),
a common strategy is to apply RCD to the dual problem. On the other hand, when
the number of features is much larger than the number of examples, it makes
sense to apply RCD directly to the primal problem. In this paper we provide the
first joint study of these two approaches when applied to L2-regularized ERM.
First, we show through a rigorous analysis that for dense data, the above
intuition is precisely correct. However, we find that for sparse and structured
data, primal RCD can significantly outperform dual RCD even if $d \ll n$, and
vice versa, dual RCD can be much faster than primal RCD even if $n \ll d$.
Moreover, we show that, surprisingly, a single sampling strategy minimizes both
the (bound on the) number of iterations and the overall expected complexity of
RCD. Note that the latter complexity measure also takes into account the
average cost of the iterations, which depends on the structure and sparsity of
the data, and on the sampling strategy employed. We confirm our theoretical
predictions using extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data sets.

discovered in the 1960-70s, remain incompletely understood and so provide both
a source of controversy amongst theoreticians, and a stimulus to
experimentalists and simulators to find new ways of penetrating the
""crystallization curtain"" that effectively shields the problem from solution.
Recently a new door on the problem was opened by showing that, in ideal
solutions, made using ionic liquid solutes, water anomalies are not destroyed
as earlier found for common salt and most molecular solutes, but instead are
enhanced to the point of precipitating an apparently first order liquid-liquid
transition. The evidence was a spike in apparent heat capacity during cooling
that could be fully reversed during reheating before any sign of ice
crystallization appeared. Here, we use decoupled-oscillator infrared
spectroscopy to define the structural character of this phenomenon using
similar down and upscan rates as in the calorimetric study. Thin-film samples
also permit slow scans (1 K/min) in which the transition has a width of less
than 1 K, and is fully reversible. The OH spectrum changes discontinuously at
the phase-transition temperature, indicating a discrete change in hydrogen-bond
structure. The spectral changes show that the low-temperature liquid is more
strongly hydrogen bonded and less disordered as compared to the
high-temperature liquid. The spectrum of the low-temperature liquid is
essentially that seen in low-density amorphous water. This similarity suggests
that the liquid-liquid transition observed here also exists in neat undercooled
water, providing a unified explanation for many of its anomalies.

the main message, we also refine existing deviation inequalities, which allow
us to design fully sequential strategies with finite-time regret guarantees

in the minimax sense. Furthermore we provide empirical evidence that the theory
also holds in practice and discuss extensions to non-gaussian and

accretion disk and of the axial field, which leads to a specific direction for
the axial electric current, azimuthal magnetic field, and the resulting
observed transverse Faraday-rotation (FR) gradient across the jet, due to the
systematic change in the line-of-sight magnetic field.

differentiate between sound waves and isobaric perturbations in Chandra images
of the Perseus and M87/Virgo clusters. The comparison of the manipulated images
with the radio data and with the results of detailed spectral analysis shows
that this approach successfully classifies the types of perturbations and helps
to reveal their nature. For the central regions (5-100 kpc) of the M87 and
Perseus clusters this analysis suggests that observed images are dominated by
isobaric perturbations, followed by perturbations caused by bubbles of
relativistic plasma and weak shocks. Such a hierarchy is best explained in a
""slow"" AGN feedback scenario, when much of the mechanical energy output of a
central black hole is captured by the bubble enthalpy that is gradually
released during buoyant rise of the bubbles. The ""image arithmetic"" works best
for prominent structure and for datasets with excellent statistics, visualizing
the perturbations with a given effective equation of state. The same approach
can be extended to faint perturbations via cross-spectrum analysis of surface
brightness fluctuations in X-ray images in different energy bands.

for years. However, the data collected by WSNs can also be used to manage their
operation and avoid unnecessary measurements that do not provide any new
knowledge about the environment. The benefits are twofold because wireless
sensor nodes may save their limited energy resources and also reduce the
wireless medium occupancy. We present a self-managed platform that collects and
stores data from sensor nodes, analyzes its contents and uses the built
knowledge to adjust the operation of the entire network. The system
architecture facilitates the incorporation of traditional WSNs into the
Internet of Things by abstracting the lower communication layers and allowing
decisions based on the data relevance. Finally, we demonstrate the platform
optimizing a WSN's operation at runtime, based on different real-time data
analysis.

level $0$ player adopts a very simple response to current conditions, a level
$1$ player best-responds to a model in which others take level $0$ actions, and
so forth. (This is analogous to $k$-ply exploration of game trees in AI, and to
receding-horizon control in control theory.) If players have deterministic
mental models with this kind of finite-level response, there is obviously no
way their mental models can all be consistent. Nevertheless, there is
experimental evidence that people act this way in many situations, motivating
the question of what the dynamics of such interactions lead to.
  We address this question in the setting of Fisher Markets with constant
elasticities of substitution (CES) utilities, in the weak gross substitutes
(WGS) regime. We show that despite the inconsistency of the mental models, and
even if players' models change arbitrarily from round to round, the market
converges to its unique equilibrium. (We show this for both synchronous and
asynchronous discrete-time updates.) Moreover, the result is computationally
feasible in the sense that the convergence rate is linear, i.e., the distance
to equilibrium decays exponentially fast. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first result that demonstrates, in Fisher markets, convergence at any rate
for dynamics driven by a plausible model of seller incentives. Even for the
simple case of (level $0$) best-response dynamics, where we observe that
convergence at some rate can be derived from recent results in convex
optimization, our result is the first to demonstrate a linear rate of
convergence.

well-approximated by convex combinations of i.i.d. states. Recently, it was
shown that in many quantum information applications a more relaxed de Finetti
reduction (i.e. only a matrix inequality between the symmetric state and one of
de Finetti form) is enough, and that it leads to more concise and elegant
arguments. Here we show several uses and general flexible applicability of a
constrained de Finetti reduction in quantum information theory, which was
recently discovered by Duan, Severini and Winter. In particular we show that
the technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation
action, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that,
in some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular
separability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly
interesting in the context of the complexity class $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of
interactive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our
results relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$
protocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of
certain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to
infinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de
Finetti techniques in the quantum case.

study the low-energy sector of the Heisenberg Necklace model and estimate the
effect of the coupling between the nuclear and the electronic spins on the

the Necklace model has a characteristic energy scale, $\Lambda \sim
J^{1/3}(\gamma I)^{2/3}$, at which the coupling between spins of the necklace
and the spins of the Heisenberg chain becomes strong. In the strong magnetic
field $\mu_B B > \Lambda$ the low energy spectrum is gapless, but two gapless
bosonic modes have different velocities whose ratio at strong fields approaches
a universal number, $\sqrt 2 +1$. In the case of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ the energy scale
$\Lambda $ is sizable and comparable to the Neel ordering temperature induced
by the inter-chain coupling, and thus could noticeably modify the low
temperature magnon dynamics. We further find that the above energy scale is
insensitive to strong magnetic field, $\mu_B B \gg \Lambda \sim J^{1/3}(\gamma
I)^{2/3}$, and therefore the interaction with nuclear spins cannot lead to
unusually strong magnetic field dependence of the magnon spectrum observed by
ESR in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, which has been attributed to the magnon interaction with
the Higgs mode.

vorticity and entropy perturbations in the upstream flow. We find that, as the
perturbations cross the shock, their total turbulent kinetic energy is
amplified by a factor of $\sim\!2$, while the average linear size of turbulent
eddies decreases by about the same factor. These values are not sensitive to
the parameters of the upstream turbulence and the nuclear dissociation

energy (VHE) gamma-ray range with the Cherenkov telescope MAGIC-I from March
2007 to June 2009 for a total of 96 hours of effective time after quality cuts.
The VHE flux variability is quantified with several methods, including the
Bayesian Block algorithm, which is applied to data from Cherenkov telescopes
for the first time. The 2.3 year long MAGIC light curve is complemented with
data from the Swift/BAT and RXTE/ASM satellites and the KVA, GASP-WEBT, OVRO,
and Mets\""ahovi telescopes from February 2007 to July 2009, allowing for an
excellent characterisation of the multi-band variability and correlations over
year time scales. Mrk 421 was found in different gamma-ray emission states
during the 2.3 year long observation period. Flares and different levels of
variability in the gamma-ray light curve could be identified with the Bayesian
Block algorithm. The same behaviour of a quiet and active emission was found in
the X-ray light curves measured by Swift/BAT and the RXTE/ASM, with a direct
correlation in time. The behaviour of the optical light curve of GASP-WEBT and
the radio light curves by OVRO and Mets\""ahovi are different as they show no
coincident features with the higher energetic light curves and a less variable
emission. The fractional variability is overall increasing with energy. The
comparable variability in the X-ray and VHE bands and their direct correlation
during both high- and low-activity periods spanning many months show that the
electron populations radiating the X-ray and gamma-ray photons are either the
same, as expected in the Synchrotron-Self-Compton mechanism, or at least
strongly correlated, as expected in electromagnetic cascades.

suggesting the existence of a new resonance $\phi$ with mass $M\sim 750$~GeV.
If $\phi$ plays the role of a portal particle connecting the Standard Model and
the invisible dark sector, the diphoton excess should be correlated with
another photon excess, namely, the excess in the diffuse gamma rays towards the
Galactic center, which can be interpreted by the annihilation of dark
matter(DM). We investigate the necessary conditions for a consistent
explanation for the two photon excesses, especially the requirement on the
width-to-mass ratio $\Gamma/M$ and $\phi$ decay channels, in a collection of DM
models where the DM particle can be scalar, fermionionic and vector, and $\phi$
can be generated through $s$-channel $gg$ fusion or $q\bar q$ annihilation. We
show that the minimally required $\Gamma/M$ is determined by a single parameter
proportional to $(m_{\chi}/M)^{n}$, where the integer $n$ depends on the nature
of the DM particle. We find that for the scalar DM model with $\phi$ generated
from $q\bar q$ annihilation, the minimally required $\Gamma/M$ can be as low as
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. For the scalar DM model with $\phi$ generated from $gg$
fusion and fermionic DM model with $\phi$ from $q\bar q$ annihilation, the
required $\Gamma/M$ are typically of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. The vector DM
models, however, require very large $\Gamma/M$ of order one. For the DM models
which can consistently explain both the excesses,the predicted cross sections
for gamma-ray line are typically of
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-31}-10^{-29})~\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}$, which are close to
the current limits from the Fermi-LAT experiment.
