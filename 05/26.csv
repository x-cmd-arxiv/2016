method to implement distributed CNOT gates in parallel whilst minimizing the
amount of quantum communication. For more general functions, we show that
nearly all Boolean functions require close to $2n$ bits of classical
communication to compute and close to $n$ qubits if the parties have access to
pre-shared entanglement. Both of these values are maximal for their respective
paradigms.

encountered in computational science and engineering. The applicability of most
existing methods is limited by matrix structures, property of eigen-solutions,
size of the problem, etc. This paper aims to break those limitations and to
develop robust and universal NEP solvers for large-scale engineering
applications. The novelty lies in two aspects. First, a rational interpolation
approach (RIA) is proposed based on the Keldysh theorem for holomorphic matrix
functions. Comparing with the existing contour integral approach (CIA), the RIA
provides the possibility to select sampling points in more general regions and
has advantages in improving accuracy and reducing computational cost. Second, a
resolvent sampling scheme using the RIA is proposed for constructing reliable
search spaces for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, based on which a robust
eigen-solver, denoted by RSRR, is developed for solving general NEPs. RSRR can
be easily implemented and parallelized. The advantages of the RIA and the
performance of RSRR are demonstrated by a variety of benchmark and practical
problems.

  Approach","Accepted to AsiaCCS 2017",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2011 Bhaskar et al. pointed out that in many cases one can ensure
sufficient level of privacy without adding noise by utilizing adversarial
uncertainty. Informally speaking, this observation comes from the fact that if
at least a part of the data is randomized from the adversary's point of view,
it can be effectively used for hiding other values. So far the approach to that
idea in the literature was mostly purely asymptotic, which greatly limited its
adaptation in real-life scenarios. In this paper we aim to make the concept of
utilizing adversarial uncertainty not only an interesting theoretical idea, but
rather a practically useful technique, complementary to differential privacy,
which is the state-of-the-art definition of privacy. This requires
non-asymptotic privacy guarantees, more realistic approach to the randomness
inherently present in the data and to the adversary's knowledge. In our paper
we extend the concept proposed by Bhaskar et al. and present some results for
wider class of data. In particular we cover the data sets that are dependent.
We also introduce rigorous adversarial model. Moreover, in contrast to most of
previous papers in this field, we give detailed (non-asymptotic) results which
is motivated by practical reasons. Note that it required a modified approach
and more subtle mathematical tools, including Stein method which, to the best
of our knowledge, was not used in privacy research before. Apart from that, we
show how to combine adversarial uncertainty with differential privacy approach
and explore synergy between them to enhance the privacy parameters already
present in the data itself by adding small amount of noise.

precision from binary modelling and provide crucial constraints for seismic

convective core and therefore allow for a determination of parameters
describing interior physics, especially the convective-core overshooting
parameter. KIC\,10080943 is a binary system that contains two gravity- and
pressure-mode hybrid pulsators. A detailed observational study has provided
fundamental and seismic parameters for both components. We aim to find a model
that is able to predict the observed g-mode period spacings and stellar
parameters of both components of KIC 10080943. By calculating model grids with
the stellar evolution code MESA and the seismic code GYRE, we can compare
theoretical properties to the observed mean period spacing and position in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The masses of our best models are somewhat below
the values estimated from binarity, which is a consequence of the low observed
mean g-mode period spacing. We find that the amount of core overshooting and
diffusive mixing can be well constrained by the equal-age requirement for the
two stars, however, we find no significant difference for different shapes of
core overshooting. The measured rotation rates are within the limit of validity
for the first-order perturbation approximation. We can find a good fit by using
the traditional approximation for the pulsations, when taking slightly younger
models with a higher asymptotic period spacing. This is because the zonal modes
experience a slight shift due to the Coriolis force, which the first-order
perturbation approximation ignores.

thereby inherently limited by the noise imposed by thermal diffusion. The
precision at which biochemical receptors can count signalling molecules is
intimately related to the noise correlation time. In addition to passive
thermal diffusion, messenger RNA and vesicle-engulfed signalling molecules can
transiently bind to molecular motors and are actively transported across
biological cells. Active transport is most beneficial when trafficking occurs
over large distances, for instance up to the order of 1 metre in neurons. Here
we explain how intermittent active transport allows for faster equilibration
upon a change in concentration triggered by biochemical stimuli. Moreover, we
show how intermittent active excursions induce qualitative changes in the noise
in effectively one-dimensional systems such as dendrites. Thereby they allow
for significantly improved signalling precision in the sense of a smaller
relative deviation in the concentration read-out by the receptor. On the basis
of linear response theory we derive the exact mean field precision limit for
counting actively transported molecules. We explain how intermittent active
excursions disrupt the recurrence in the molecular motion, thereby facilitating
improved signalling accuracy. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how
recurrence affects molecular signalling precision in biological cells and novel
diagnostic devices.

in the stellar Ly-alpha line, showing deep, repeated transits caused by a giant
exosphere of neutral hydrogen. The low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host
star was shown to play a major role in the dynamics of the escaping gas. Yet by
itself it cannot explain the time-variable spectral features detected in each
transit. Here we investigate the combined role of radiative braking and stellar
wind interactions using numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet
code (EVE) and we derive atmospheric and stellar properties through the direct
comparison of simulated and observed spectra. Our simulations match the last
two epochs well. The observed sharp early ingresses come from the abrasion of
the planetary coma by the stellar wind. Spectra observed during the transit can
be produced by a dual exosphere of planetary neutrals (escaped from the upper
atmosphere of the planet) and neutralized protons (created by charge-exchange
with the stellar wind). We find similar properties at both epochs for the
planetary escape rate (2.5x10$^{8}$ g/s), the stellar photoionization rate
(2x10$^{-5}$ /s), the stellar wind bulk velocity (85 km/s), and its kinetic
dispersion velocity (10 km/s). We find high velocities for the escaping gas
(50-60 km/s) that may indicate MHD waves that dissipate in the upper atmosphere
and drive the planetary outflow. In the last epoch the high density of the
stellar wind (3x10$^{3}$ /cm3) led to the formation of an exospheric tail
mainly composed of neutralized protons. The observations of GJ436 b allow for
the first time to clearly separate the contributions of radiation pressure and
stellar wind and to probe the regions of the exosphere shaped by each
mechanism.

possible explanations can be given for this result: i) the mean orbit of the

eccentricity around 0.01 kpc$^{-1}$; or ii) there is a net secular expansion of
the disk, in which stars within $R\approx 9-11$ kpc are migrating to the region

ratio would be unattainable for a long time and it should decelerate, otherwise
the Galaxy would fade away in around 1 Gyr. At present, both hypotheses are

is constrained jointly by ultraviolet line strengths measured with the Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and X-ray flux

and mixing. In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by
the percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving),
and large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the
upward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which
remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or
numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small
particles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in
large particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides
with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and
the connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed
through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids
hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing
large particles. Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes
rotation and empowers more large particles to reach the top layer, implying
that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our
findings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add
new evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective
for the study of segregation.

  Results: Using estrogen receptor $\alpha$ signalling response as a model

consistent changes in alternative splicing independent of changes in absolute
expression and genes where some transcripts change while others stay constant

to find the (extremal) graph $G$ on $n$ vertices which maximizes $c_{r,
\widehat{F}}(G)$. This problem generalizes a question of Erd{\H o}s and
Rothschild, who originally asked about the number of colorings not containing a
monochromatic clique (which is equivalent to the case where $F$ is a clique and
the partition $\widehat{F}$ contains a single class). We use H\""{o}lder's
Inequality together with Zykov's Symmetrization to prove that, for any $r \geq

exists a complete multipartite graph that is extremal. Furthermore, if the
pattern $\widehat{K_k}$ has at least two classes, with the possible exception
of two very small patterns (on three or four vertices), every extremal graph
must be a complete multipartite graph. In the case that $r=3$ and $\widehat{F}$
is a rainbow triangle (that is, where $F=K_3$ and each part is a singleton), we
show that an extremal graph must be an almost complete graph. Still for $r=3$,
we extend a result about monochromatic patterns of Alon, Balogh, Keevash and
Sudakov to some patterns that use two of the three colors, finding the exact
extremal graph. For the later two results, we use the Regularity and Stability

such as the Kohn-Sham density functional theory, have wide applications in
physics, chemistry and material science. The computational cost of first
principle phonon calculations typically scales steeply as $\mathcal{O}(N_e^4)$,
where $N_e$ is the number of electrons in the system. In this work, we develop
a new method to reduce the computational complexity of computing the full
dynamical matrix, and hence the phonon spectrum, to $\mathcal{O}(N_e^3)$. The
key concept for achieving this is to compress the polarizability operator
adaptively with respect to the perturbation of the potential due to the change
of the atomic configuration. Such adaptively compressed polarizability operator
(ACP) allows accurate computation of the phonon spectrum. The reduction of
complexity only weakly depends on the size of the band gap, and our method is
applicable to insulators as well as semiconductors with small band gaps. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using one-dimensional and
two-dimensional model problems.

numerical model to simulate beaming of magnetar flare emission. In our
simulations, radiation escapes from the base of a fireball trapped in a dipolar
magnetic field, and is scattered through the optically thick magnetosphere of
the magnetar until it escapes. Beaming is provided by the presence of a
relativistic outflow, as well as by the geometry of the system. We find that a

clusters with a richness of multi-wavelength data, and thus a good target to
study the star formation-density relation at early epochs. Using a sample of
spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members, we derive the star formation rates
of our galaxies using two methods, (I) the relation between SFR and total
infrared luminosity extrapolated from the observed \textit{Spitzer} MIPS
24$\mu$m imaging data, and (II) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting
using the MAGPHYS code, including eight different bands.
  We show that, for this cluster, the SFR-density relation is very weak and
seems to be dominated by the two central galaxies and the SFR presents a mild
dependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies having higher SFR.
However, the specific SFR (SSFR) decreases with stellar mass, meaning that more
massive galaxies are forming less stars per unit of mass, and thus suggesting
that the increase in star-forming members is driven by cluster assembly and
infall.
  If the environment is somehow driving the SF, one would expect a relation
between the SSFR and the cluster centric distance, but that is not the case. A
possible scenario to explain this lack of correlation is the contamination by
infalling galaxies in the inner part of the cluster which may be on their
initial pass through the cluster center. As these galaxies have higher SFRs for
their stellar mass, they enhance the mean SSFR in the center of the cluster.

proposed as a promising technique for wireless networks. It sequentially
cancels out the known interferences at each node so that wireless multi-hop
transmission can achieve a similar throughput as single-hop transmission.
Existing work on E2E-KIC assumed that the interference of a transmitter to
those nodes outside the transmitter's communication range is negligible. In
practice, however, this assumption is not always valid. There are many cases
where a transmitter causes notable interference to nodes beyond its
communication distance. From a wireless networking perspective, such
interference is caused by a node to other nodes that are multiple hops away,
thus we call it multi-hop interference. The presence of multi-hop interference
poses fundamental challenges to E2E-KIC, where known procedures cannot be
directly applied. In this paper, we propose an E2E-KIC approach which allows
the existence of multi-hop interference. In particular, we present a method
that iteratively cancels unknown interferences transmitted across multiple
hops. We analyze mathematically why and when this approach works and the
performance of it. The analysis is further supported by numerical results.

radial velocity of the orbiting white dwarf. Instead we propose that the
observed velocities are the sum of the radial velocities of both the white

Aqr. However asymmetries in the orbital configuration are required to explain
the double peaked velocity profile. One possible scenario would invoke binary
eccentricity. We thus developed a simple binary model to explain and fit our
observations, and find a small binary eccentricity of e=0.03. Although small,
persistent eccentricity in a close interacting binary would induce enhanced
mass transfer occurring preferentially at periastron passages. We thus discuss
alternative scenarios where other asymmetries might explain our observations
assuming circular orbits. Since FO Aqr is the first system where the combined
radial velocities of both the WD and secondary surface have been measured, it
is possible that other mass-transferring binaries also display similar velocity
curves when observed with Kepler. These will provide additional valuable tests

obscured by Compton-thick gas columns. Based upon long-term flux dimming,
previous work suggested the alternate possibility that the source is a recently

Our high-quality data show the source to be reflection-dominated in hard
X-rays, but with a relatively weak neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission line
(equivalent width [EW] of $\approx$ 0.4 keV) and a strong Fe XXVI ionised line
(EW $\approx$ 0.2 keV). We construct an updated long-term X-ray light curve of
NGC 7674 and find that the observed 2-10 keV flux has remained constant for the
past $\approx$ 20 years, following a high flux state probed by $Ginga$. Light
travel time arguments constrain the minimum radius of the reflector to be
$\sim$ 3.2 pc under the switched-off AGN scenario, $\approx$ 30 times larger

A patchy Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN) solution is plausible, requiring a minimum

been detected in several emerging massive star clusters. These detections
suggest that the timescale for clusters to emerge can be at least as long as
the time required to produce WR stars (a few million years), and could also
indicate that WR stars may be providing the tipping point in the combined
feedback processes that drive a massive star cluster to emerge. We explore the
potential overlap between the emerging phase and the WR phase with an
observational survey to search for WR stars in emerging massive star clusters
hosting WR stars. We select candidate emerging massive star clusters from known
radio continuum sources with thermal emission and obtain optical spectra with
the 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and the 6.5m MMT. We
identify 21 sources with significantly detected WR signatures, which we term

quenching star formation in its host galaxy. The nuclear spectrum shows broad
and blueshifted H$\beta$ in absorption, which is tracing outflowing gas with
high densities ($>10^8$ - $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$) and velocities in excess of 10,000
km s$^{-1}$. The properties of the outflowing clouds (covering factor, density,
column density and inferred location) indicate that they likely originate from
the Broad Line Region. The energetics of such nuclear regions are consistent
with that observed in the large scale outflow, supporting models in which
quasar driven outflows originate from the nuclear region and are energy
conserving. We note that the asymmetric profile of both the H$\beta$ and
H$\alpha$ emission lines is likely due to absorption by the dense outflowing
gas along the line of sight. This outflow-induced asymmetry has implications on
the estimation of the black hole mass using virial estimators, and warns about
such effects for several other quasars characterized by similar line
asymmetries. More generally, our findings may suggest a broader revision of the
decomposition and interpretation of quasar spectral features, in order to take
into account the presence of potential broad blueshifted Balmer absorption
lines. Our high spatial resolution data also reveals redshifted, dynamically

disordered thin films undergoing a magnetic field-tuned
superconductor-insulator transition. The theory may enable one to access both
the critical properties of the strong-disorder limit, which has recently been
confirmed by Breznay et al. [PNAS 113, 280 (2016)] to exhibit particle-vortex
symmetric electrical response, and the nearby metallic phase discovered earlier
by Mason and Kapitulnik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5341 (1999)] in less disordered
samples. Within the effective theory, the Cooper-pair and field-induced vortex
degrees of freedom are simultaneously incorporated into an electrically-neutral
Dirac fermion minimally coupled to an (emergent) Chern-Simons gauge field. A
derivation of the theory follows upon mapping the superconductor-insulator
transition to the integer quantum Hall plateau transition and the subsequent
use of Son's particle-hole symmetric composite Fermi liquid. Remarkably,
particle-vortex symmetric response does not require the introduction of
disorder; rather, it results when the Dirac fermions exhibit vanishing Hall
effect. The theory predicts approximately equal (diagonal) thermopower and
Nernst signal with a deviation parameterized by the measured electrical Hall
response at the symmetric point.

states that arise in such theories and investigate their cosmological effects.
Glueballs are first formed in a confining phase transition, and their relic
densities are set by a network of annihilation and transfer reactions. The
lightest glueball has no lighter states to annihilate into, and its yield is
set mainly by 3 to 2 number-changing processes which persistently release
energy into the glueball gas during freeze-out. The abundances of the heavier
glueballs are dominated by 2 to 2 transfer reactions, and tend to be much
smaller than the lightest state. We also investigate potential connectors
between the dark force and the Standard Model that allow some or all of the
dark glueballs to decay. If the connection is weak, the lightest glueball can
be very long-lived or stable and is a viable dark matter candidate. For
stronger connections, the lightest glueball will decay quickly but other
heavier glueball states can remain stable and contribute to the dark matter
density.

the Kanata telescopes. The Suzaku observations were conducted seven times with
various intervals ranging from days, weeks, to months, with an exposure of
$\sim50$ ksec each. The optical $B$-band observations not only covered those of
Suzaku almost simultaneously, but also followed the source as frequently as
possible. As a result, NGC 3516 was found in its faint phase with the 2-10 keV
flux of $0.21-2.70 \times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The 2-45 keV X-ray
spectra were composed of a dominant variable hard power-law continuum with a
photon index of $\sim1.7$, and a non-relativistic reflection component with a
prominent Fe-K$\alpha$ emission line. Producing the $B$-band light curve by
differential image photometry, we found that the $B$-band flux changed by
$\sim2.7 \times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is comparable to the
X-ray variation, and detected a significant flux correlation between the hard
power-law component in X-rays and the $B$-band radiation, for the first time in

that of $B$ band by $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ days ($1\sigma$ error). Although this

We perform hydrodynamical simulations of isolated cluster (total mass 10^14 /h
M_sun), which is initially evolved to form a dense cool core, having central
T<10^6 K. A BH resides at the cluster center, and ejects energy. The
feedback-driven fast wind undergoes shock with the slower-moving gas, which
causes the imparted kinetic energy to be thermalized. Bipolar bubble-like
outflows form propagating radially outward to a distance of a few 100 kpc. The
radial profiles of median gas properties are influenced by BH feedback in the
inner regions (r<20-50 kpc). BH kinetic feedback, with a large value of the
feedback efficiency, depletes the inner cool gas and reduces the hot gas
content, such that the initial cool core of the cluster is heated up within a
time 1.9 Gyr, whereby the core median temperature rises to above 10^7 K, and
the central entropy flattens. Our implementation of BH thermal feedback (using
the same efficiency as kinetic), within the star-formation model, cannot do
this heating, where the cool core remains. The inclusion of cold gas accretion

find that both objects possess relatively smooth, but extremely rapid mass
growth histories with consistently high star formation rates and UV
luminosities at $z{>}11$, indicating that their brightness is not a transient,
merger-driven feature. Our model results suggest that future wide-field surveys
with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} may be able to detect the
progenitors of GN-z11 analogues out to $z{\sim}$13--14, pushing the frontiers
of galaxy-formation observations to the early phases of cosmic reionization and

$s$-channel DM coannihilation through a scalar diquark mediator as a
representative case study of scenarios with strongly interacting coannihilation
partners. We discuss the full phenomenology of the model, ranging from low
energy flavor constraints, vacuum stability requirements, and precision Higgs

centroid of HeII 1640. HeII has a low equivalent width but is often
well-defined in high-S/N spectra, does not suffer from self-absorption, and has
a narrow component that, when present (the case for about half of our sources),
produces a redshift estimate that, on average, is consistent with that
determined from [OII] to within 1-sigma of the quadrature sum of the HeII and
[OII] centroid measurement uncertainties. The large redshift differences of
~1000 km/s, on average, between the BOSS-pipeline and HeII-centroid redshifts
suggest there are significant biases in a portion of BOSS quasar redshift
measurements. Adopting the HeII-based redshifts shows that CIV does not exhibit
a ubiquitous blueshift for all quasars, given the precision probed by our
measurements. Instead, we find a distribution of CIV centroid blueshifts across
our sample, with a dynamic range that (i) is wider than that previously
reported for this line, and (ii) spans CIV centroids from those consistent with
the systemic redshift to those with significant blueshifts of thousands of
kilometers per second. These results have significant implications for

usage of SNIa as distance indicators. We analyse a homogeneous sample of 22
low-z SNIa, observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) in the optical and
near infra-red (NIR). We study the time of the second peak in the NIR band due
to re-brightening, t2, as an alternative standardisation parameter of SNIa peak
brightness. We use BAHAMAS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for SNIa cosmology,
to determine the residual scatter in the Hubble diagram. We find that in the
absence of a colour correction, t2 is a better standardisation parameter
compared to stretch: t2 has a 1 sigma posterior interval for the Hubble
residual scatter of [0.250, 0.257] , compared to [0.280, 0.287] when stretch
(x1) alone is used. We demonstrate that when employed together with a colour
correction, t2 and stretch lead to similar residual scatter. Using colour,
stretch and t2 jointly as standardisation parameters does not result in any
further reduction in scatter, suggesting that t2 carries redundant information
with respect to stretch and colour. With a much larger SNIa NIR sample at
higher redshift in the future, t2 could be a useful quantity to perform
robustness checks of the standardisation procedure.

any degree and do not rely on lattice algorithms, thus eliminating the
possibility of even superpolynomial-time improvements to Coppersmith's bound.

background light (stellar EBL) is caused primarily by finite age of the
Universe because the finite age limits the number of photons pumped into the
space by galaxies and thus the sky is dark in the night. We oppose this opinion
and show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity
of the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,
which causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light
extinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces
a partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces
the intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by
foreground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a
galaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not
contribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is
dimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic
opacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects
on the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust
and is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming
static infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar
EBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is
considered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is
only 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has
higher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the
calculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration
effect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts
when the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present.

dramatically reduces computational requirements, bringing calculations from the

on possible ways to bootstrap without positivity, extending the method to

1.5-2.5Msun stars with Z=0.002. Oxygen-rich stars constitute the majority of
the sample (65%), mainly low mass stars (<2Msun) that produce a negligible

from IC 1613, mostly determined by carbon stars, to be 6x10^{-7}Msun/yr with an

interpret the AGB population in an environment different from the MCs opens the
possibility to extend this kind of analysis to other Local Group galaxies.

The algorithm generates the spectral density of the lattice Dirac operator as a
continuous function over all scales of the complete eigenvalue spectrum. This
is distinct from an earlier method where the integrated spectral density (mode
number) was calculated efficiently for some preselected fixed range of the
integration. The new algorithm allows global studies like the chiral condensate
from the Dirac spectrum at any scale including the cutoff-dependent IR and UV
range of the spectrum. Physics applications include the scale-dependent mass
anomalous dimension, spectral representation of composite fermion operators,
and the crossover transition from the $\epsilon$-regime of Random Matrix Theory

approximate solutions for general $d$. However, obtaining an exact solution in
very high dimensions seems to be much less understood. We consider the

rectangular matrix multiplication bounds. Computing the dominance product
itself is an important task, since it is applied in many algorithms as a major
black-box ingredient, such as algorithms for APBP (all pairs bottleneck paths),

long-standing problems. However, dramatic changes were still ahead of him. In
recent years hardly anybody knew where he was living, and even if he was still

perturbation analysis of the large D effective equations with 1/D^1/2

at the same time as observed in numerical analysis. The elastic instability
does disappear at the infinite limit of a ring radius, which implies that the

observe that the Gregory-Laflamme like instability becomes more efficient than
the elastic instability even for certain thin black rings in enough higher

special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ has been a long-standing open
problem. In this paper, we construct a novel non-Markovian coupling for
bounding this mixing time. The analysis of our coupling entails controlling the
smallest singular value of a certain random matrix with highly dependent
entries. The dependence of the entries in our matrix makes it not-amenable to
existing techniques in random matrix theory. To circumvent this difficulty, we
extend some recent bounds on the smallest singular values of matrices with
independent entries to our setting. These bounds imply that the mixing time of
Kac's walk on the group $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is between $C_{1} n^{2}$ and $C_{2}
n^{4} \log(n)$ for some explicit constants $0 < C_{1}, C_{2} < \infty$,
substantially improving on the bound of $O(n^{5} \log(n)^{2})$ by Jiang. Our
methods may also be applied to other high dimensional Gibbs samplers with
constraints and thus are of independent interest. In addition to giving
analytical bounds on the mixing time, our approach allows us to compute
rigorous estimates of the mixing time by simulating the eigenvalues of a random
matrix.

present a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal

action proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative action
proposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them
using optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few
proposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate that
this ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several such
proposals are generated for each video of the same action. Our next challenge
is to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals are
globally consistent. We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graph
problem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across the
videos. The output of our method is the most action representative proposals
from each video. Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the same
action in a video. We have validated our approach on three challenging action
datasets: UCF Sport, sub-JHMDB and THUMOS'13 and have obtained promising
results compared to several baseline methods. Moreover, on UCF Sports, we
demonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtained

several million years to the age of the universe. The numbers of clusters
younger and older than 1 Gyr are respectively 46 and 260. With ages and
metallicities determined, cluster masses are then estimated by comparing the

manifestations of solar eruptions. The overtaken solar wind forms a sheath of
compressed plasma at the front of ICMEs. Magnetic clouds (MCs) are a subset of
ICMEs with specific properties (e.g. the presence of a flux rope). When ICMEs
pass near Earth, ground observations indicate that the flux of galactic cosmic
rays (GCRs) decreases. The main aims of this paper are to find: common plasma
and magnetic properties of different ICME sub-structures, and which ICME
properties affect the flux of GCRs near Earth. We use a superposed epoch method
applied to a large set of ICMEs observed \insitu\ by the spacecraft ACE,
between 1998 and 2006. We also apply a superposed epoch analysis on GCRs time
series observed with the McMurdo neutron monitors. We find that slow MCs at 1
AU have on average more massive sheaths. We conclude that it is because they
are more effectively slowed down by drag during their travel from the Sun. Slow
MCs also have a more symmetric magnetic field and sheaths expanding similarly
as their following MC, while in contrast, fast MCs have an asymmetric magnetic
profile and a compressing sheath in compression. In all types of MCs, we find
that the proton density and the temperature, as well as the magnetic
fluctuations can diffuse within the front of the MC due to 3D reconnection.
Finally, we derive a quantitative model which describes the decrease of cosmic
rays as a function of the amount of magnetic fluctuations and field strength.
The obtained typical profiles of sheath/MC/GCR properties corresponding to
slow, mid, and fast ICMEs, can be used for forecasting/modelling these events,
and to better understand the transport of energetic particles in ICMEs. They
are also useful for improving future operative space weather activities.

central source VLA 1 associated with a rotating disk deeply embedded in a
flattened envelope. Here we present the observations of this system at ~ 0.6""
(240 AU) resolution in C18O (J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum obtained with Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, and in SO obtained with Submillimeter
Array. The observations show for the first time how a Keplerian rotating disk
can be formed inside a flattened envelope. The flattened envelope is detected
in C18O, extending out to >~ 2400 AU from the VLA 1 source. It has a
differential rotation, with the outer part (>~ 2000 AU) better described by a
rotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the innermost part (<~
160 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The rotationally supported disk is therefore
relatively compact in this system, which is consistent with the dust continuum
observations. Most interestingly, if the flow is in steady state, there is a
substantial drop in specific angular momentum in the envelope-disk transition
region from 2000 AU to 160 AU, by a factor of ~ 3. Such a decrease is not
expected outside a disk formed from simple hydrodynamic core collapse, but can
happen naturally if the core is significantly magnetized, because magnetic
fields can be trapped in the transition region outside the disk by the ram
pressure of the protostellar accretion flow, which can lead to efficient
magnetic braking. In addition, SO shock emission is detected around the outer
radius of the disk and could trace an accretion shock around the disk.

low-rank approximation with satisfactory accuracy, measured by the overall

bounds of the upwards heat flux, as given by the Nusselt number ${\rm Nu}$, in
terms of the forcing via the imposed temperature difference, as given by the
Rayleigh number in the turbulent regime ${\rm Ra}\gg 1$. In several works, the
background field method applied to the temperature field has been used to
provide upper bounds on ${\rm Nu}$ in terms of ${\rm Ra}$. In these
applications, the background field method comes in form of a variational
problem where one optimizes a stratified temperature profile subject to a
certain stability condition; the method is believed to capture marginal
stability of the boundary layer. The best available upper bound via this method
is ${\rm Nu}$ $\lesssim {\rm Ra}^\frac{1}{3}(\ln {\rm Ra})^\frac{1}{15}$; it
proceeds via the construction of a stable temperature background profile that
increases logarithmically in the bulk. In this paper, we show that the
background temperature field method cannot provide a tighter upper bound in
terms of the power of the logarithm. However, by another method one does obtain
the tighter upper bound ${\rm Nu}\lesssim {\rm Ra}^\frac{1}{3}(\ln\ln {\rm
Ra})^\frac{1}{3}$, so that the result of this paper implies that the background
temperature field method is unphysical in the sense that it cannot provide the
optimal bound.

inverse Compton scattering (ICS) dominates over the bremsstrahlung on producing

the ICS radiation at GeV energies concentrates along the Galactic plane. The

volume-preserving algorithm. Detailed phase-space behaviors of runaway
electrons are investigated in different dynamical timescales spanning 11
orders. When looking into the small timescale, i.e., the characteristic
timescale imposed by Lorentz force, the severely deformed helical trajectory of
energetic runaway electron is witnessed. A qualitative analysis of the
neoclassical scattering, a kind of collisionless pitch-angle scattering
phenomena, is provided when considering the coupling between the rotation of
momentum vector and the background magnetic field. In large timescale up to one
second, it is found that the initial condition of runaway electrons in phase
space globally influences the pitch-angle scattering, the momentum evolution,
and the loss-gain ratio of runaway energy evidently. However, the initial value
has little impact on the synchrotron energy limit. It is also discovered that
the parameters of tokamak device, such as the toroidal magnetic field, the loop
voltage, the safety factor profile, and the major radius, can modify the
synchrotron energy limit as well as the strength of neoclassical scattering.
The maximum runaway energy is also proved to be lower than the synchrotron
limit when the magnetic field ripple is considered.

create a new image with the content of one image but the style statistics of
another image. Here, we extend this method to render a movie in a given
artistic style. The naive solution that independently renders each frame
produces poor results because the features of the style move substantially from
one frame to the next. The other naive method that initializes the optimization
for the next frame using the rendered version of the previous frame also
produces poor results because the features of the texture stay fixed relative
to the frame of the movie instead of moving with objects in the scene. The main
contribution of this paper is to use optical flow to initialize the style
transfer optimization so that the texture features move with the objects in the
video. Finally, we suggest a method to incorporate optical flow explicitly into
the cost function.

this paper, we first present very simple classical protocols for die-rolling

that differences in financial constraints among players leads to a tougher

nanomaterial, the diamond nanothread (DNT), as a reinforcement for
nanocomposites. Owing to the existence of Stone-Wales transformation defects,
the DNT intrinsically possesses irregular surfaces, which is expected to
enhance the non-covalent interfacial load transfer. Through a series of in
silico pull-out studies of the DNT in polyethylene (PE) matrix, we found that
the load transfer between DNT and PE matrix is dominated by the non-covalent
interactions, in particular the van der Waals interactions. Although the
hydrogenated surface of the DNT reduces the strength of the van der Waals
interactions at the interface, the irregular surface of the DNT can compensate
for the weak bonds. These factors lead to an interfacial shear strength of the
DNT/PE interface comparable with that of the carbon nanotube (CNT)/PE
interface. Our results show that the DNT/PE interfacial shear strength remains
high even as the number of Stone-Wales transformation defects decreases. It can
be enhanced further by increasing the PE density or introduction of functional
groups to the DNT, both of which greatly increase the non-covalent
interactions.

Ising interactions along the legs and along the rungs alternate between
$X_{i}X_{i+1}$ and $Z_{i}Z_{i+1}$ for even/odd bond (rung). We include also the
next nearest neighbor Ising interactions on plaquettes' diagonals that
alternate in such a way that a model where only leg interactions are switched
on is equivalent to the one when only the diagonal ones are present. Thus in
the absence of rung interactions the model can interpolate between two 1D
compass models. The model posses local symmetries which are the parities within
each $2\times 2$ cell (plaquette) of the ladder. We find that for different
values of the interaction it can realize ground states that differ by the
patterns formed by these local parities. By exact diagonalization we derive
detailed phase diagrams for small systems of $L=4$, 6 and 8 plaquettes, and use
next $L=12$ to identify generic phases that appear in larger systems as well.
Among them we find a nematic phase with macroscopic degeneracy when the leg and
diagonal interactions are equal and the rung interactions are larger than a
critical value. The nematic phase is similar to the one found in the
two-dimensional compass model. For particular parameters the low-energy sector
of the present plaquette model reduces to a 1D compass model with spins $S=1$
which suggests that it realizes peculiar crossovers within the class of compass
models. Finally, we show that the model can realize phases with broken
translation invariance which can be either dimerized, trimerized,
\textit{etcetera}, or completely disordered and highly entangled in a~well
identified window of the phase diagram.

polarization in networks with fixed, strongly connected neighbor relationships
when the opinion dynamics are described by DeGroot-type averaging rules. We
develop this line of research in this paper in two steps. First, we consider
fixed, not necessarily strongly connected, neighbor relationships. It is shown
that if the network includes a strongly connected subnetwork containing
mistrust, which influences the rest of the network, then no opinion clustering
is possible when that subnetwork is not structurally balanced; all the opinions
become neutralized in the end. In contrast, it is shown that when that
subnetwork is indeed structurally balanced, the agents of the subnetwork evolve
into two polarized camps and the opinions of all other agents in the network
spread between these two polarized opinions. Second, we consider time-varying
neighbor relationships. We show that the opinion separation criteria carry over
if the conditions for fixed graphs are extended to joint graphs. The results
are developed for both discrete-time and continuous-time models.

paper, we use not only a deeper 6 Ms Chandra survey of the Chandra Deep Field
South (CDF-S), but combine these data with the 3 Ms XMM-Newton survey of the
CDF-S. We also take advantage of the great coverage of the CDF-S region from
the UV to the far-IR to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our
sources. Out of the 14 AGN composing our sample, 9 are highly absorbed (but
only 3 could be CT AGN), whereas 2 look unabsorbed, and the other 3 are only
moderately absorbed. In only one of the CT AGN, we detect a strong Fe K$\alpha$
emission line; the source is already classified as a CT AGN with Chandra data
in a previous work. For the other two CT candidates, the non-detection of the
line could be because of the low number of counts in their X-ray spectra, but
their location in the L$_{\rm 2-10\,keV}$/L$_{12\mu m}$ plot supports their CT
classification. Although a higher number of CT sources could be hidden among
the X-ray undetected DOGs, our results indicate that DOGs could be as well
composed of only a fraction of CT AGN plus a number of moderate to highly
absorbed AGN, as previously suggested. From our study of the X-ray undetected
DOGs in the CDF-S, we estimate a percentage between 13 and 44% of CT AGN among

concept of centrality, which is used to investigate the embeddedness of firms
from a particular country within the global network. The study results in three
contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge for the first time we can
investigate the topology as well as the concept of centrality in corporate
networks at a global scale, allowing for the largest cross-country comparison
ever done in interlocking directorates literature. We demonstrate, amongst
other things, extremely similar network topologies, yet large differences
between countries when it comes to the relation between economic prominence
indicators and firm centrality. Second, we introduce two new metrics that are
specifically suitable for comparing the centrality ranking of a partition to
that of the full network. Using the notion of centrality persistence we propose
to measure the persistence of a partition's centrality ranking in the full
network. In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to
which the footprint of a national network is still present within the global
network. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a
partition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality
ranking of the full (global) network. Finally, comparing these two new measures
of persistence and dominance between different countries allows us to classify
these countries based the their embeddedness, measured using the relation
between the centrality of a country's firms on the national and the global
scale of the board interlock network.

return of the condensate to its initial state as long as the pulses remain
sufficiently weak. In contrast, once the maximum driving amplitude exceeds a
certain critical value there should be a drastic loss of coherence, reflecting
significant heating induced by the pulse. This predicted experimental signature
is traced to the loss of an effective adiabatic invariant, and to the ensuing
breakdown of adiabatic motion of the system's Floquet state when the many-body

two-site model of a forced bosonic Josephson junction, but should also hold for

bundle is introduced.
  The second section is a little broader and includes two approaches to study
the geometry of complex manifold $E.$ The first part contains the study of the
tangent bundle $T_{C}E=T^{\prime }E\oplus T^{\prime \prime }E$ and its link,
via tangent anchor map, with the complexified tangent bundle $% T_{C}(T^{\prime
}M)=T^{\prime }(T^{\prime }M)\oplus T^{\prime \prime }(T^{\prime }M).$ A
holomorphic Lie algebroid structure has been emphasized on $T^{\prime }E.$ A
special study is made for integral curves of a spray on $% T^{\prime }E.$
Theorem 2.1 gives the coefficients of a spray, called canonical, according to a
complex Lagrangian on $T^{\prime }E.$ In the second part of section two we
study the prolongation $\mathcal{T}% ^{\prime }E$ of $E\times T^{\prime }E$
algebroid structure.
  In the third section we study how a complex Lagrange (Finsler) structure on
$T^{\prime }M$ induces a Lagrangian structure on $E.$ Three particular cases
are analyzed by the rank of anchor map, the dimensions of manifold $M$ and the
fibre dimension. We obtain the correspondent on $E$ of the well-known

differences are important for the TGF production. Diurnal cycle of TGFs peaks
in the afternoon suggesting that Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)

over South America in the same period have been analysed to find meteorological
preferences for TGF occurrence. In each passage the analysis of Cloud Top
Altitude (CTA), CAPE, number of strokes, number of storms and coverage area of
clouds with temperatures below $-70\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$ (Cloud Top Coverage area,
CTC) are computed. On average, AGILE has been exposed to 19,100 strokes between
each TGF representing $\sim$68 hours of exposure over active storms. High CAPE
values, high cloud tops and high stroke occurrence suggests that meteorological
conditions conducive to vigorous and electrically active storms are important
for TGF production. It is shown that a high number of thunderstorms is
preferable for TGF production which may be explained by a greater chance of the
presence of a thunderstorm in the best development stage for TGF production.
High tropopause altitude seems to be important but not primordial for TGF

conditions, this coupling is affected by the spurious interaction between the
2D material and its periodic images. To overcome this, we perform density
functional perturbation theory calculations with a truncated Coulomb
interaction in the out-of-plane direction. We show that the 2D Fr\""ohlich
interaction is much stronger than assumed in previous ab initio studies. We
provide analytical models depending on the effective charges and dielectric
properties of the materials to interpret our ab initio calculations. Screening
is shown to play a fundamental role in the phonon-momentum dependency of the
polar-optical coupling, with a crossover between two regimes depending on the
dielectric properties of the material relative to its environment. The
Fr\""ohlich interaction is screened by the dielectric environment in the limit
of small phonon momenta and sharply decreases due to stronger screening by the
monolayer at finite momenta. The small-momentum regime of the ab initio
Fr\""ohlich interaction is reproduced by a simple analytical model, for which we
provide the necessary parameters. At larger momenta, however, direct ab initio
calculations of electron-phonon interactions are necessary to capture
band-specific effects. We compute and compare the carrier relaxation times
associated to the scattering by both LO and A1 phonon modes. While both modes
are capable of relaxing carriers on timescales under the picosecond at room
temperature, their absolute and relative importance vary strongly depending on
the material, the band, and the substrate.

nearest neighbour spin-spin correlations along the a and c axes are found to be
weakly antiferromagnetic. The nature of the trimer spin structure of the

employing a variant of the skeleton graph expansion, and a high frequency
cutoff that is essential for maintaining the known high-T entropy. The
resulting quasiparticle weight $Z$, the low $\omega,T $ self energy and the
resistivity are reported. These are quite close at all densities to the exact
numerical results of the $U=\infty$ Hubbard model, obtained using the dynamical
mean field theory. The present calculation offers the advantage of generalizing
to finite $T$ rather easily, and allows the visualization of the loss of
coherence of Fermi liquid quasiparticles by raising $T$. The present scheme is
generalizable to finite dimensions and a non vanishing $J$.

unification scale. We revisit this simple situation taking into account the

fixed in order to explain the Higgs boson and the Z boson masses, there is no
free parameter left in this scenario. We find that there are three independent
parameter sets exist including ones which have not been discussed in the
literature. We also find that the abundance of the dark matter can be explained
by relic gravitinos which are non-thermally produced as decay products of the
SUSY particles while satisfying constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We
discuss the effects of the gravity mediation which generically give
contribution to the soft terms of the order of the gravitino mass. It turns out

simple decisions from brain signals measured before subjects are aware of their

with the underlying assumption that the ability to classify the brain signal is
equivalent to predict the decision itself. Here we show instead that it is
possible to correctly classify a signal even if it does not contain any
predictive information about the decision. We first define a simple stochastic
model that mimics the random decision process between two equivalent
alternatives, and generate a large number of independent trials that contain no
choice-predictive information. The trials are first time-locked to the time
point of the final event and then classified using standard machine-learning
techniques. The resulting classification accuracy is above chance level long
before the time point of time-locking. We then analyze the same trials using
information theory. We demonstrate that the high classification accuracy is a
consequence of time-locking and that its time behavior is simply related to the
large relaxation time of the process. We conclude that when time-locking is a
crucial step in the analysis of neural activity patterns, both the emergence
and the timing of the classification accuracy are affected by structural
properties of the network that generates the signal.

that the phase lags of the reversals of the magnetic fields at the poles follow
the same variation as that of the hemispheric cycles in Cycles 12-23, i.e. in
four cyles one of the hemispheres leads and the leading role jumps to the

types of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity
profile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated
self-consistently in most 1D models. We compared the results to those of 3D

model can approximate the surface temperatures calculated by the 3D models. The
1D parameter study results in a large range of climates possible for an
Earth-sized planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and water reservoir at a
certain stellar insolation. At some stellar insolations the full spectrum of
climate states could be realized, i.e., uninhabitable conditions as well as
habitable surface conditions, depending only on the relative humidity and
surface albedo assumed. When treating the surface albedo and the relative
humidity profile as parameters in 1D model studies and using the habitability
constraints found by recent 3D modeling studies, the same conclusions about the

Supplementary material included in the paper as well",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the stochastic Riemannian gradient algorithm for matrix
eigen-decomposition. The state-of-the-art stochastic Riemannian algorithm
requires the learning rate to decay to zero and thus suffers from slow
convergence and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address this issue by
deploying the variance reduction (VR) technique of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). The technique was originally developed to solve convex problems in the
Euclidean space. We generalize it to Riemannian manifolds and realize it to
solve the non-convex eigen-decomposition problem. We are the first to propose
and analyze the generalization of SVRG to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically,
we propose the general variance reduction form, SVRRG, in the framework of the
stochastic Riemannian gradient optimization. It's then specialized to the
problem with eigensolvers and induces the SVRRG-EIGS algorithm. We provide a
novel and elegant theoretical analysis on this algorithm. The theory shows that
a fixed learning rate can be used in the Riemannian setting with an exponential
global convergence rate guaranteed. The theoretical results make a significant
improvement over existing studies, with the effectiveness empirically verified.

the labels $\hat{Y} \subset Y$ for which we do not observe any corresponding

very important especially when the label set is large and the cost of

prohibitively high. Most recent approaches to zero-shot learning are based on
finding and exploiting relationships between labels using semantic embeddings.
We show in this paper that semantic embeddings, despite being very good at
capturing relationships between labels, are not very good at capturing the
relationships among labels in a data-dependent manner. For this reason, we
propose a novel two-step process for learning a zero-shot classifier. In the
first step, we learn what we call a \emph{property embedding space} capturing
the ""\emph{learnable}"" features of the label set. Then, we exploit the learned
properties in order to reduce the generalization error for a linear nearest

X-ray source (ULX) Holmberg IX X-1 obtained by the Swift, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR

~10^40 erg s^-1, that varied by a factor of 4 - 5 over eight years. We find
that its spectra tend to evolve from relatively flat or two-component spectra
in the medium energy band (1-6 keV), at lower luminosities, to a spectrum that
is distinctly curved and disc-like at the highest luminosities, with the peak
energy in the curved spectrum tending to decrease with increased luminosity. We
argue that the spectral evolution of the ULX can be explained by
super-Eddington accretion models, where in this case we view the ULX down the
evacuated funnel along its rotation axis, bounded by its massive radiatively
driven wind. The spectral changes then originate in enhanced geometric beaming
as the accretion rate increases and wind funnel narrows, causing the scattered
flux from the central regions of the supercritical flow to brighten faster than
the isotropic thermal emission from the wind, and so the curved hard spectral
component to dominate at the highest luminosities. The wind also Compton
down-scatters photons at the edge of the funnel, resulting in the peak energy
of the spectrum decreasing. We also confirm that Holmberg IX X-1 displays
spectral degeneracy with luminosity, and suggest that the observed differences
are naturally explained by precession of the black hole rotation axis for the
suggested wind geometry.

high performance all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Divalent Sn(II) based oxides
are promising candidates because of their rather dispersive upper valence bands
caused by the Sn-5s/O-2p anti-bonding hybridization. There are so far few known
Sn(II) oxides being p-type conductive suitable for device applications. Here,
we present via first-principles global optimization structure searches a
material design study for a hitherto unexplored Sn(II)-based system, ternary
alkaline-earth metal Sn(II) oxides in the stoichiometry of MSn2O3 (M = Mg, Ca,
Sr, Ba). We identify two stable compounds of SrSn2O3 and BaSn2O3, which can be
stabilized by Sn-rich conditions in phase stability diagrams. Their structures
follow the Zintl behaviour and consist of basic structural motifs of SnO3
tetrahedra. Unexpectedly they show distinct electronic properties with band
gaps ranging from 1.90 (BaSn2O3) to 3.15 (SrSn2O3) eV, and hole effective
masses ranging from 0.87 (BaSn2O3) to above 6.0 (SrSn2O3) m0. Further
exploration of metastable phases indicates a wide tunability of electronic
properties controlled by the details of the bonding between the basic
structural motifs. This suggests further exploration of alkaline-earth metal
Sn(II) oxides for potential applications requiring good p-type conductivity
such as transparent conductors and photovoltaic absorbers.

They include vertex corrections of different complexity. Commonly used
quasiparticle approximation for the Green function and static approximation for
the screened interaction are avoided altogether. Using alkali metals Na and K
as well as semiconductor Si and wide gap insulator LiF as examples, it is shown
that both the vertex corrections in the polarizability P and in the self energy
$\Sigma$ are important. Particularly, vertex corrections in $\Sigma$ with
proper treatment of frequency dependence of the screened interaction always
reduce calculated band widths/gaps, improving the agreement with experiment.
The complexity of the vertex included in P and in $\Sigma$ can be different.
Whereas in the case of polarizability one generally has to solve the
Bethe-Salpeter equation for the corresponding vertex function, it is enough
(for the materials in this study) to include the vertex of the first order in
the self energy. The calculations with appropriate vertices show remarkable
improvement in the calculated band widths and band gaps as compared to the
self-consistent GW approximation as well as to the self-consistent
quasiparticle GW approximation.

in a forward-backward diffusion pseudo-parabolic equation. Three asymptotic
regimes are distinguished as t tends to infinity, the first being a regime
ahead of the propagating disturbance that is dominated by the linearised
equation. The analysis of this leads to the determination of the speed of the
leading edge of the propagating disturbance and implies that in the second,
transition, regime the solution takes the form of a modulated travelling wave.
In a third regime the solution approaches a nearly periodic steady state, where
the period is obtained on matching with the modulated travelling wave. Detailed
analysis of this pattern is also presented. The analysis is completed by
contrasting the formal asymptotic description of the solution with numerical
computations. It is assumed for the above analysis that the initial disturbance
decays faster than an exponential rate; in this case a critical exponential
decay rate at the leading edge of the front and propagation speed are found. We
investigate the wave speed selection mechanism for exponentially decaying
initial conditions. It is found that whenever the initial data behave as a real
exponential (no matter how slow the rate of the decay) the speed selected is
that selected by fast decaying initial conditions. However, for initial
conditions with a complex exponential we find regimes of the decay rate and the
wavelength for which the front propagates at a faster wave speed. This is
investigated numerically and is worth emphasising since it gives a different
scenario for wave speed behaviour than that exhibited by well-studied
semilinear reaction-diffusion equations: there are initial conditions with
exponential decay faster than the critical one for which the front propagates
with a speed faster than the critical one.

largely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively
exploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the
performance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as

long-range potential $D/r^3$ and subject to a square-lattice substrate
potential $V({\bf r})$ with amplitude $V$ and lattice constant $b$. The
isotropic interaction favors a hexagonal arrangement of the particles with
lattice constant $a$, which competes against the square symmetry of the
substrate lattice. We determine the minimal-energy states at fixed external
pressure $p$ generating the commensurate density $n = 1/b^2 = (4/3)^{1/2}/a^2$
in the absence of thermal and quantum fluctuations, using both analytical and
numerical techniques. At large substrate amplitude $V > 0.2\, e_D$, with $e_D =
D/b^3$ the dipolar energy scale, the particles reside in the substrate minima
and hence arrange in a square lattice. Upon decreasing $V$, the square lattice
turns unstable with respect to a zone-boundary shear-mode and deforms into a
period-doubled zig-zag lattice. Analytic and numerical results show that this
period-doubled phase in turn becomes unstable at $V \approx 0.074\, e_D$
towards a non-uniform phase developing an array of domain walls or solitons; as
the density of solitons increases, the particle arrangement approaches that of
a rhombic (or isosceles triangular) lattice. At a yet smaller substrate value
estimated as $V \approx 0.046\, e_D$, a further solitonic transition
establishes a second non-uniform phase which smoothly approaches the hexagonal
(or equilateral triangular) lattice phase with vanishing amplitude $V$. At
small but finite amplitude $V$, the hexagonal phase is distorted and
hexatically locked at an angle of $\varphi \approx 3.8^\circ$ with respect to
the substrate lattice. The square-to-hexagonal transformation in this
two-dimensional commensurate-incommensurate system thus involves a complex
pathway with various non-trivial lattice- and modulated phases.

testing) rely on first obtaining a model of the system under analysis. System
modeling is often done manually, which is often considered as a hindrance to
adopt model-based system analysis and development techniques. To overcome this
problem, researchers have proposed to automatically ""learn"" models based on
sample system executions and shown that the learned models can be useful
sometimes. There are however many questions to be answered. For instance, how
much shall we generalize from the observed samples and how fast would learning
converge? Or, would the analysis result based on the learned model be more
accurate than the estimation we could have obtained by sampling many system
executions within the same amount of time? In this work, we investigate
existing algorithms for learning probabilistic models for model checking,
propose an evolution-based approach for better controlling the degree of
generalization and conduct an empirical study in order to answer the questions.
One of our findings is that the effectiveness of learning may sometimes be
limited.

(TAF), to recover an unknown vector $\bm{x}$ from a system of quadratic
equations of the form $y_i=|\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle|^2$, where
$\bm{a}_i$'s are given random measurement vectors. This problem is known to be
\emph{NP-hard} in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations is
on the order of the number of unknowns, TAF recovers the solution exactly (up
to a global unimodular constant) with high probability and complexity growing
linearly with both the number of unknowns and the number of equations. Our TAF
approach adopts the \emph{amplitude-based} empirical loss function, and
proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we introduce an
\emph{orthogonality-promoting} initialization that can be obtained with a few
power iterations. Stage two refines the initial estimate by successive updates
of scalable \emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}, which are able to
handle the rather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth amplitude-based objective
function. In particular, when vectors $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{a}_i$'s are
real-valued, our gradient truncation rule provably eliminates erroneously
estimated signs with high probability to markedly improve upon its untruncated
version. Numerical tests using synthetic data and real images demonstrate that
our initialization returns more accurate and robust estimates relative to
spectral initializations. Furthermore, even under the same initialization, the
proposed amplitude-based refinement outperforms existing Wirtinger flow
variants, corroborating the superior performance of TAF over state-of-the-art
algorithms.

that regular event structures correspond exactly to event structures obtained
as unfoldings of finite 1-safe Petri nets. The same counterexample is used to
disprove a closely related conjecture by Badouel, Darondeau, and Raoult (1999)
that domains of regular event structures with bounded $\natural$-cliques are
recognizable by finite trace automata. Event structures, trace automata, and
Petri nets are fundamental models in concurrency theory. There exist nice
interpretations of these structures as combinatorial and geometric objects.
Namely, from a graph theoretical point of view, the domains of prime event
structures correspond exactly to median graphs; from a geometric point of view,
these domains are in bijection with CAT(0) cube complexes.
  A necessary condition for both conjectures to be true is that domains of
regular event structures (with bounded $\natural$-cliques) admit a regular nice
labeling. To disprove these conjectures, we describe a regular event domain
(with bounded $\natural$-cliques) that does not admit a regular nice labeling.
Our counterexample is derived from an example by Wise (1996 and 2007) of a
nonpositively curved square complex whose universal cover is a CAT(0) square
complex containing a particular plane with an aperiodic tiling. We prove that
other counterexamples to Thiagarajan's conjecture arise from aperiodic 4-way
deterministic tile sets of Kari and Papasoglu (1999) and Lukkarila (2009).
  On the positive side, using breakthrough results by Agol (2013) and Haglund
and Wise (2008, 2012) from geometric group theory, we prove that Thiagarajan's
conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains occur as
principal filters of hyperbolic CAT(0) cube complexes which are universal
covers of finite nonpositively curved cube complexes.

an analyst to halt a computation before his pre-specified privacy budget is

as he goes, without needing to pre-specify a privacy budget. We show that
unlike the case in which privacy parameters are fixed, in the adaptive

privacy filters with bounds comparable (up to constants) with existing privacy
composition theorems. We also give a privacy odometer that nearly matches
non-adaptive private composition theorems, but is sometimes worse by a small

equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are
based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a
probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic
model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine
scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework
proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is
capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that
unavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily
extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are
reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to
produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic
observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these
quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the
model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The
issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by
employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions,
revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible
and parallelizable Monte Carlo - Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is
proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative
assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system
and the SPC/E water model.

or the region of multi-TeV momentum transfers. In this contribution we briefly
summarise the studies presented in the PDF section of the upcoming report on
""Physics at a 100 TeV pp collider: Standard Model processes"". First we map the
PDF kinematical coverage in the $(x,Q^2)$ plane, quantify PDF uncertainties,
and compute ratios of PDF luminosities between 100 TeV and 14 TeV. Then we show
how the extreme kinematics of such collider lead to a number of remarkable

role of photon-initiated processes and the possible need of PDFs with

generate the predicted block when considering strong spatial correlation.
However, this kind of single line-based method does not always work well due to
at least two issues. One is the incoherence caused by the signal noise or the
texture of other object, where this texture deviates from the inherent texture
of the current block. The other reason is that the nearest reference line
usually has worse reconstruction quality in block-based video coding. Due to
these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multiple line-based intra

line, further reference lines are also utilized. The further reference lines
with relatively higher quality can provide potential better prediction. At the

which may be relevant in systems of nano- or micro-scale particles where
rolling is an approximation for strong static friction. We consider the
simplest possible non-trivial system: a linear polymer of three of discs
constrained to remain in contact, and immersed in an equilibrium heat bath so
the internal angle of the polymer changes due to stochastic fluctuations. We
compare two cases: one where the discs can slide relative to each other, and
the other where they are constrained to roll, like gears. Starting from the
Langevin equations with arbitrary linear velocity constraints, we use formal
homogenization theory to derive the overdamped equations that describe the
process in configuration space only. The resulting dynamics have the formal
structure of a Brownian motion on a Riemannian or sub-Riemannian manifold,
depending on if the velocity constraints are holonomic or non-holonomic. We use
this to compute the trimer's equilibrium distribution both with, and without,
the rolling constraints. Surprisingly, the two distributions are different. We
suggest two possible interpretations of this result: either (i) dry friction
(or other dissipative, nonequilibrium forces) changes basic thermodynamic
quantities like the free energy of a system, a statement that could be tested
experimentally, or (ii) as a lesson in modeling rolling or friction more
generally as a velocity constraint when stochastic fluctuations are present. In
the latter case, we speculate there could be a ""roughness"" entropy whose
inclusion as an effective force could compensate the constraint and preserve
classical Boltzmann statistics. Regardless of the interpretation, our
calculation shows the word ""rolling"" must be used with care when stochastic
fluctuations are present.

effective tool for interference mitigation. CA in WMNs is an NP-Hard problem,
and makes optimality a desired yet elusive goal in real-time deployments which
are characterized by fast transmission and switching times and minimal
end-to-end latency. The trade-off between optimal performance and minimal
response times is often achieved through CA schemes that employ heuristics to
propose efficient solutions. WMN configuration and physical layout are also
crucial factors which decide network performance, and it has been demonstrated
in numerous research works that rectangular/square grid WMNs outperform random
or unplanned WMN deployments in terms of network capacity, latency, and network
resilience. In this work, we propose a smart heuristic approach to devise a
near-optimal CA algorithm for grid WMNs (NOCAG). We demonstrate the efficacy of
NOCAG by evaluating its performance against the minimal-interference CA
generated through a rudimentary brute-force technique (BFCA), for the same WMN
configuration. We assess its ability to mitigate interference both,
theoretically (through interference estimation metrics) and experimentally (by
running rigorous simulations in NS-3). We demonstrate that the performance of
NOCAG is almost as good as the BFCA, at a minimal computational overhead of
O(n) compared to the exponential of BFCA.

with strong potential impact in industry and consumer use, such as automated
mapping, urban planning, real estate and environment monitoring, or disaster
relief. The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remote
sensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated image
understanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automatic
geolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads and
intersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literature
that could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data is
not available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from the
detection of roads and intersections, to the identification of the enclosing
geographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learned
manually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between the
detected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset with
aerial images of two European cities and use the publicly available
OpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show in
extensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizations
in the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on the
other and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also show
that the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotations
can be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detection
results.

presence of gas giant planets. These observations contradict both assumptions
and predictions of the highly successful Core Accretion model of planet
formation. Here we explore predictions of the alternative Tidal Downsizing (TD)
scenario of planet formation. In TD, small planets and planetesimal debris is
made only when gas fragments, predecessors of giant planets, are tidally
disrupted. We show that these disruptions are rare in discs around high
metallicity stars but release more debris per disruption than their low [M/H]
analogs. This predicts no simple relation between debris disc presence and host
star's [M/H], as observed. A detected gas giant planet implies in TD that its
predecessor fragment was not disputed, potentially explaining why DDs are less
likely to be found around stars with gas giants. Less massive planets should
correlate with DD presence, and sub-Saturn planets ($M_{p} \sim 50

($M_{p} \leq 15 \M_{\oplus}$). These predicted planet-DD correlations will be
diluted and weakened in observations by planetary systems' long term evolution

the role of the multiple mergers that take place during the formation stage of
such systems in the configuration of the remnants assembled at their centres.
An analysis of a suite of 48 simulations of low-mass forming groups (of about
1E13 solar masses) demonstrates that the gravitational dynamics involved in
their hierarchical collapse is capable of creating realistic first-ranked
galaxies without the aid of dissipative processes. Our simulations indicate
that the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) constitute a distinct population from
other group members, sketching a scenario in which the assembly path of these
objects is dictated largely by the formation of their host system. We detect
significant differences in the distribution of Sersic indices and total
magnitudes, as well as a luminosity gap between BGGs and the next brightest
galaxy that is positively correlated with the total luminosity of the parent
group. Such gaps arise from both the grow of BGGs at the expense of lesser
companions and the decrease in the relevance of second-ranked objects in equal
measure. This results in a dearth of intermediate-mass galaxies which explains
the characteristic central dip detected in their luminosity functions in
dynamically young galaxy aggregations. The fact that the basic global
properties of our BGGs define a thin mass fundamental plane strikingly similar
to that followed giant early-type galaxies in the local universe reinforces
confidence in the results obtained.

the hyperbolic conservation laws in the high-order local polynomial-based

schemes. The high-order polynomial approximation generally fails to correctly
capture a strong discontinuity inside a cell due to the Runge phenomenon, which
is replaced by more stable approximation on the basis of a troubled-cell

paper examines the applicability of a new algorithm, so-called boundary
variation diminishing (BVD) reconstruction, to the weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology in the FR framework including the nodal type
DG method. The BVD reconstruction adaptively chooses a proper approximation for
the solution function so as to minimize the jump between values at the left-

parameter. Several numerical tests are conducted for a linear advection
equation as well as the selection of an appropriate reconstruction, where the
results of the BVD algorithm are comparable to those using the conventional TVB

plasma generates a polarization of the associated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)

regime and for a thermal electron population and, as such, has limited
astrophysical applications. Partial attempts to extend this calculation for a
thermal electron plasma in the relativistic regime have been done but cannot be
applied to a general relativistic electron distribution. Here we derive a
general form of the SZ effect polarization valid in the full relativistic
approach for both thermal and non-thermal electron plasmas, as well as for a
generic combination of various electron population co-spatially distributed in
the environments of galaxy clusters or radiogalaxy lobes. We derive the
spectral shape of the Stokes parameters induced by the IC scattering of every
CMB multipole, focusing on the CMB quadrupole and octupole that provide the
largest detectable signals in galaxy clusters. We found that the CMB quadrupole
induced Stoke parameter Q is always positive with a maximum amplitude at 216
GHz which increases slightly with increasing cluster temperature. The CMB
octupole induced Q spectrum shows, instead, a cross-over frequency which
depends on the cluster electron temperature, or on the minimum momentum p_1 as
well as on the power-law spectral index of a non-thermal electron population.
We discuss some possibilities to disentangle the quadrupole-induced Q spectrum
from the octupole-induced one which allow to measure these quantities through
the SZ effect polarization. We finally apply our model to the realistic case of
the Bullet cluster and derive the visibility windows of the total,
quandrupole-induced and octupole-induced Stoke parameter Q in the frequency

significant investment of telescope time; it is therefore tempting to focus on
the systems with the brightest sources, the highest image multiplicities and
the widest image separations. We investigate if this selection bias can
influence the properties of the lenses studied and the cosmological parameters
that are inferred. Using a population of lenses with ellipsoidal powerlaw
density profiles, we build a sample of double and quadruple image systems.
Assuming reasonable thresholds on image separation and flux, based on current
lens monitoring campaigns, we find that the typical density profile slopes of
monitorable lenses are significantly shallower than the input ensemble. From a
sample of quadruple image lenses we find that this selection function can
introduce a 3.5% bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the ensemble of
deflector properties is used as a prior for a cosmographical analysis. This
bias remains at the 2.4% level when high resolution imaging of the quasar host
is used to precisely infer the density profiles of individual lenses. We also
investigate if the lines-of-sight for monitorable strong lenses are biased.
After adding external convergence, $\kappa$, and shear to our lens population
we find that the expectation value for $\kappa$ is increased by 0.004 and 0.009
for doubles and quads respectively. $\kappa$ is degenerate with the value of
$H_0$ inferred from time delays; fortunately the shift in $\kappa$ only induces
a 0.9 (0.4) percent bias on $H_0$ for quads (doubles). We therefore conclude
that whilst the properties of typical quasar lenses and their lines-of-sight do
deviate from the global population, the total magnitude of this effect is
likely a subdominant effect for current analyses, but has the potential to be a
major systematic for samples of $\sim$25 or more lenses.

  dimensional local fields",,,,,"math.NT math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  K. Kato's conjecture about the cohomological Hasse principle for regular
connected schemes $\mathfrak X$ which are flat and proper over the complete
discrete valuation rings $\mathcal O_N$ of higher local fields $F_N$ is proven.
This generalizes the work of M. Kerz, S. Saito and U. Jannsen for finite fields
to the case of all higher local fields. For that purpose a $p$-alteration
theorem for the local uniformization of schemes over valuation rings of
arbitrary finite rank and a corresponding Bertini theorem is developed
extending the results of O. Gabber, J. deJong, L. Illusie, M. Temkin, S. Saito,
U. Jannsen to the non-noetherian world. As an application it is shown that
certain motivic cohomology groups of varieties over higher local fields are
finite. This is one of the rare cases where such a result could be shown for
schemes without finite or separably closed residue fields. Furthermore, it will
be derived that the kernels of the reciprocity map $\rho^X : \text{SK}_N(X) \to
\pi_1^\text{ab}(X)$ and norm map $N_{X|F}: \text{SK}_N(X) \to K_N^M(F_N)$
modulo maximal $p'$-divisible subgroups are finite for regular $X$ which are
proper over a higher local field $F_N$ with final residue characteristic $p$.
This generalizes results of S. Bloch, K. Kato, U. Jannsen, S. Saito from
varieties over finite and local fields to varieties over higher local fields,
both of arbitrary dimensions.

homoclinic tangles near the divertor magnetic saddle in tokamak discharges.
These tangles intersect the divertor plates in static helical structures that
delimit the regions reached by open magnetic field lines reaching the plasma
column and leading the charged particles to the strike surfaces by parallel
transport. In this article we introduce a non-axisymmetric rotating magnetic
perturbation to model the time development of the three-dimensional magnetic
field of a single-null DIII-D tokamak discharge developing a rotating tearing
mode. The stable and unstable manifolds of the asymmetric magnetic saddle are
calculated through an adaptive method providing the manifold cuts at a given
poloidal plane and the strike surfaces. For the modeled shot, the experimental
heat pattern and its time development are well described by the rotating
unstable manifold, indicating the emergence of homoclinic lobes in a rotating
frame due to the plasma instabilities. In the model it is assumed that the
magnetic field is created by a stationary axisymmetric plasma current and a set
of rotating internal helical filamentary currents. The currents in the
filaments are adjusted to match the waveforms of the magnetic probes at the
mid-plane and the rotating magnetic field is introduced as a perturbation to
the axisymmetric field obtained from a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium
reconstruction code.

resonance acceleration regime are computed numerically and analytically. The
dependence of fundamental frequency on the laser intensity and magnetic
resonance parameter is examined carefully. By calculating the emission of a
single electron in a circularly polarized plane-wave laser field and constant
external magnetic field, the scale invariance of the radiation spectra is
evident in terms of harmonic orders. The scaling law of backscattered spectra
are exhibited remarkably for the laser intensity as well for the initial axial
momentum of the electron when the cyclotron frequency of the electron
approaches the laser frequency. The results indicate that the magnetic
resonance parameter plays an important role on the strength of emission. And
the rich features of scattering spectra found may be applicable to the
radiation source tunability.

  Offline Eigenvector Estimation: Given an explicit $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times

eigenvector in time $\tilde O([nnz(A) + \frac{d*sr(A)}{gap^2} ]* \log

is the stable rank, $gap$ is the relative eigengap. By separating the $gap$
dependence from the $nnz(A)$ term, our first runtime improves upon the
classical power and Lanczos methods. It also improves prior work using fast
subspace embeddings [AC09, CW13] and stochastic optimization [Sha15c], giving
significantly better dependencies on $sr(A)$ and $\epsilon$. Our second running
time improves these further when $nnz(A) \le \frac{d*sr(A)}{gap^2}$.
  Online Eigenvector Estimation: Given a distribution $D$ with covariance
matrix $\Sigma$ and a vector $x_0$ which is an $O(gap)$ approximate top
eigenvector for $\Sigma$, we show how to refine to an $\epsilon$ approximation
using $ O(\frac{var(D)}{gap*\epsilon})$ samples from $D$. Here $var(D)$ is a
natural notion of variance. Combining our algorithm with previous work to
initialize $x_0$, we obtain improved sample complexity and runtime results
under a variety of assumptions on $D$.
  We achieve our results using a general framework that we believe is of
independent interest. We give a robust analysis of the classic method of
shift-and-invert preconditioning to reduce eigenvector computation to
approximately solving a sequence of linear systems. We then apply fast
stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) based system solvers to achieve our

process comes from the violation of the law of equipartition of energy in the

study a special type of quantum heat engine consisting of three processes:
isoenergetic, isothermal and adiabatic processes. Therefore, this engine works
between the energy and heat baths. Combining two engines of this kind, it is
possible to realize the quantum Carnot engine. Furthermore, considering finite
velocity of change of the potential shape, here an infinite square well with
moving walls, the power output of the engine is discussed. It is found that the
efficiency and power output are both closely dependent on the initial and final
states of the quantum isothermal process. The performance of the engine cycle
is shown to be optimized by control of the occupation probability of the ground
state, which is determined by the temperature and the potential width. The
relation between the efficiency and power output is also discussed.

Generally, it can be concluded that MLIS courses at universities in the
country, can increase the value of a master's degree of graduates at an
acceptable level, but is not perfect; it seems that the authorities should
increase their efforts to promote the value of a master's degree in graduates.
