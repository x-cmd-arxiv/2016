induced by the absorption of two-photons from two phase modulated laser beams
and subject it to experimental testing for two types of photoactive samples,
solution of rhodamine 6G and GaP photodiode. In our experiment, the phases of
the laser beams are modulated at the frequencies f1 and f2, respectively. The
action signals, such as photoluminescence and photocurrent, which result from
the absorption of two photons, are isolated at frequencies m f (f=|f1-f2|,
m=0,1,2...). We demonstrate that the ratio of the amplitudes of the secondary
(m=2) and the primary (m=1) signals is sensitive to the type of relaxation
process taken place in the system and thus can be used for its identification.
Such sensitivity originates from cumulative effects of non-equilibrated state
of the system between the light pulses. When the cumulative effects are small,
i.e. the relaxation time is much shorter then the laser repetition rate or the
laser intensity is high enough to dominate the system behavior, the ratio
achieves its reference value 1:4 (the signature of two-photon absorption). In
the intermediate regimes the ratio changes rapidly with the growth of intensity
from zero value in case of second order relaxation process, while it
demonstrates slow monotonic decrease for linear relaxation. In the article we
also determine the value of the recombination rate in a GaP photodiode by using
the above approach.

""synergistic"" information that does not exist in either source alone. This
implies that the effect of public information on shark behavior is better

cognitive radio network where the secondary receiver is treated as a potential
eavesdropper with respect to the primary transmission. The secondary user is
allowed to transmit his own signals under the condition that the primary user's
secrecy rate and transmission scheme are intact. Under this setting we derive
the secondary user's achievable rates and the related constraints to guarantee
the primary user's weak secrecy rate, when Gelfand-Pinsker coding is used at
the secondary transmitter. In addition, we propose a multi-phase transmission
scheme to include 1) the phases of the clean relaying with cooperative jamming
and 2) the latency to successfully decode the primary message at the secondary
transmitter. A capacity upper bound for the secondary user is also derived.
Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the
traditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of
different transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the
nodes; 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's
achievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary
transmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter,
respectively. Thereby, a smart secondary transmitter is able to adapt its
relaying and cooperative jamming to guarantee primary secrecy rates and to
transmit its own data at the same time from relevant geometric positions.

amounts to a uncontrolled quantum ripple that eventually degenerates into
diffusion. If the conformation of these excitonic superpositions could be
engineered, though, they would constitute a new means of transporting
information and energy. We show that properly designed laser pulses can be used
to create such excitonic wave packets. They can be formed with a prescribed
speed, direction and spectral make-up that allows them to be selectively
passed, rejected or even dissociated using superlattices. Their coherence also
provides a handle for manipulation using active, external controls. Energy and
information can be conveniently processed and subsequently removed at a distant
site by reversing the original procedure to produce a stimulated emission. The
ability to create, manage and remove structured excitons comprises the
foundation for opto-excitonic circuits with application to a wide range of
quantum information, energy and light-flow technologies. The paradigm is
demonstrated using both Tight-Binding and Time-Domain Density Functional Theory
simulations.

analyze the gamma-ray emission in five adjacent energy bands between 1 GeV and

below the break is between 1.95 and 2.0. For higher energies, a simple
power-law fits the data, with an index of 2.2^{+0.7}_{-0.3} in the energy band

dominated by the out-of-plane spin excitations of the ordered moments due to
the suppression of damping in the superconducting state. Hence we offer a new

these signals are confirmed (or other new resonances are discovered at the TeV

explanation. Motivated by these tentative signals of new physics, we
investigate the theoretical possibility that large hierarchies in the masses of
glueballs could arise dynamically in new strongly-coupled gauge theories
extending the standard model of particle physics. We study lattice data on
non-Abelian gauge theories in the (near-)conformal regime as well as a simple
toy model in the context of gauge/gravity dualities. We focus our attention on
the ratio $R$ between the mass of the lightest spin-2 and spin-0 resonances,
that for technical reasons is a particularly convenient and clean observable to
study. For models in which (non-perturbative) large anomalous dimensions arise
dynamically, we show indications that this mass ratio can be large, with $R>5$.
Moreover, our results suggest that $R$ might be related to universal properties
of the IR fixed point. Our findings provide an interesting step towards
understanding large mass ratios in the non-perturbative regime of quantum field
theories with (near) IR conformal behaviour.

imaginary parts, \sigma$_1$ and \sigma$_2$, of the complex conductivity of
superconducting Pb as a function of magnetic field. Here we find features
reminiscent of those in temperature-dependent measurements, such as a maximum
in \sigma$_1$ (coherence peak). At magnetic fields above the critical field of
this type-I superconductor we still find low-loss microwave response, which we
assign to remaining superconductivity in the form of filaments within the Pb.
Hysteresis effects are found in the quality factor of resonances once the swept
magnetic field has exceeded the critical magnetic field. This is due to normal
conducting areas that are pinned and can therefore persist in the
superconducting phase. Besides zero-field-cooling we show an alternative way to
eliminate these even at T<T$_c$. Based on our microwave data, we determine the
critical magnetic field and the critical temperature of Pb in a temperature
range between 1.6K and 6.5K and magnetic fields up to 140mT, showing good
agreement with BCS predictions. We study a Sn sample in a Pb resonator to
demonstrate the applicability of superconducting Pb stripline resonators in the
experimental study of other (super-)conducting materials in a variable magnetic
field.

scintillators ($150 \times 75 \times 5 cm^3$) placed in pairs and located in
Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has been used for the search of transient
solar events and photomuons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On September 15,
2015, at 21:18:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 150915A (trigger 655721). The GRB light curve shows a weak complex
structure of long duration $T_{90}=164.7 \pm 49.7 $ s, and a fluence in the
15-150 keV band of $8.0 \pm 1.8 \times 10^{-7}erg/cm^2$. GRB 150915A was
fortuitously located in the field of view of the New-Tupi detector, and a
search for prompt emission in the GeV energy range is presented here. The
analysis was made using the ""scaler"" or ""single-particle"" technique. The
New-Tupi detector registered a counting rate excess peak of duration
$T_{90}=(6.1\pm 0.6)$ s with a signal significance $(4.4\pm 0.5)\sigma$, (and
not $6.9\sigma$ as reported in the previous version). The signal is within the
T90 duration of the Swift BAT GRB, with an estimated ""excess"" fluence of
$F_S(E>0.1 GeV)=1.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-6} erg/cm^2$. This value can be
considered the lower limit of the gamma ray fluence in the GeV energy region.
However, the Poisson probability of the event to be a background fluctuation is
$5.0 \times 10^{-6}$ and it appears in the counting rate of the New-Tupi
detector with an annual rate $\sim 76$. In addition, the signal has a
significance of only $2\sigma$ in the time profiles with a bin above 2 seconds.
Thus we conclude that the event has a high probability to be background
fluctuation.

techniques for millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems. The two fundamental

antenna arrays of small individual elements. We overview and compare models for
both of these factors, and present a baseline analytical approach based on
stochastic geometry that allows the computation of the statistical
distributions of the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
and also the per link data rate, which depends on the SINR as well as the
average load. There are many implications of the models and analysis: (a)
mmWave systems are significantly more noise-limited than at Sub-6GHz for most
parameter configurations; (b) initial access is much more difficult in mmWave;
(c) self-backhauling is more viable than in Sub-6GHz systems which makes
ultra-dense deployments more viable, but this leads to increasingly

cellular operators can mutually benefit by sharing their spectrum licenses

by outlining several important extensions of the baseline model, many of which

problem Smallest $p$-Edge Subgraph (S$p$ES), have come to play a central role
in approximation algorithms. This is due both to their practical importance,
and their usefulness as a tool for solving and establishing approximation
bounds for other problems. These two problems are not well understood, and it
is widely believed that they do not an admit a subpolynomial approximation
ratio (although the best known hardness results do not rule this out).
  In this paper we generalize both D$k$S and S$p$ES from graphs to hypergraphs.
We consider the Densest $k$-Subhypergraph problem (given a hypergraph $(V, E)$,
find a subset $W\subseteq V$ of $k$ vertices so as to maximize the number of
hyperedges contained in $W$) and define the Minimum $p$-Union problem (given a
hypergraph, choose $p$ of the hyperedges so as to minimize the number of
vertices in their union). We focus in particular on the case where all
hyperedges have size 3, as this is the simplest non-graph setting. For this
case we provide an $O(n^{4(4-\sqrt{3})/13 + \epsilon}) \leq
O(n^{0.697831+\epsilon})$-approximation (for arbitrary constant $\epsilon > 0$)
for Densest $k$-Subhypergraph and an $\tilde O(n^{2/5})$-approximation for
Minimum $p$-Union. We also give an $O(\sqrt{m})$-approximation for Minimum
$p$-Union in general hypergraphs. Finally, we examine the interesting special
case of interval hypergraphs (instances where the vertices are a subset of the
natural numbers and the hyperedges are intervals of the line) and prove that
both problems admit an exact polynomial time solution on these instances.

three different stiffnesses: flexible, intermediate, and rodlike. Flexible and
rodlike chains, which readily solidify into close-packed crystals (respectively
with randomly oriented and nematically aligned chains), display simple melt
dynamics with Arrhenius temperature dependence and a discontinuous change upon
solidification. Intermediate-stiffness chains, however, are fragile
glass-formers displaying Vogel-Fulcher dynamical arrest, despite the fact that
they also possess a nematic-close-packed crystalline ground state. To connect
this difference in dynamics to the differing microstructure of the melts, we
examine how various measures of structure, including cluster-level metrics
recently introduced in studies of colloidal systems, vary with chain stiffness
and temperature. No clear static-structural cause of the dynamical arrest is
found. However, we find that the intermediate-stiffness chains display
qualitatively different dynamical heterogeneity. Specifically, their stringlike
correlated motion (cooperative rearrangement) is correlated along chain
backbones in a way not found for either flexible or rodlike chains. This
activated ""crawling"" motion seems to be the cause of the dynamical arrest
observed for these systems, and shows that the factors controlling the
crystallization vs.\ glass formation competition in polymers likely depend
nonmonotonically on chain stiffness.

performance. Serializable CC schemes generally pay higher cost to prevent

serializability-enforcing certifier which can be applied with minimal overhead
on top of various CC schemes that offer higher performance but admit anomalies,
such as snapshot isolation and read committed. The underlying CC retains
control of scheduling and transactional accesses, while SSN tracks the
resulting dependencies. At commit time, SSN performs an efficient validation
test by examining only direct dependencies of the committing transaction to
determine whether it can commit safely or must abort to avoid a potential
dependency cycle.
  SSN performs robustly for various workloads. It maintains the characteristics
of the underlying CC without biasing toward certain types of transactions,
though the underlying CC might. Besides traditional OLTP workloads, SSN also
allows efficient handling of heterogeneous workloads with long, read-mostly
transactions. SSN can avoid tracking the majority of reads (thus reducing the
overhead of serializability certification) and still produce serializable
executions with little overhead. The dependency tracking and validation tests
can be done efficiently, fully parallel and latch-free, for multi-version
systems on modern hardware with substantial core count and large main memory.
  We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of SSN using extensive
simulations and an implementation that overlays snapshot isolation in ERMIA, a
memory-optimized OLTP engine that is capable of running different CC schemes.
Evaluation results confirm that SSN is a promising approach to serializability
with robust performance and low overhead for various workloads.

caused by a partonic recoil, and is determined by QCD dynamics. We compute the
single and double-differential transverse momentum distributions for fully

compare our predictions for the fiducial cross sections to the 8 TeV data set
from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, which both observed a tension between

find that the inclusion of the NNLO QCD effects does not fully resolve the
tension with the data for the unnormalised $p^Z_T$ distribution. However, we
observe that normalising the NNLO $Z$-boson transverse momentum distribution by
the NNLO Drell-Yan cross section substantially improves the agreement between

frameworks that aim to help developers to address programming tasks. However,
the number of JavaScript frameworks has risen rapidly to thousands of versions.
It is challenging for practitioners to identify the frameworks that best fit
their needs and to develop new ones which fit such needs. Furthermore, there is
a lack of knowledge regarding what drives developers towards the choice. This
paper explores the factors and actors that lead to the choice of a JavaScript
framework. We conducted a qualitative interpretive study of semi-structured
interviews. We interviewed 18 decision makers regarding the JavaScript
framework selection, up to reaching theoretical saturation. Through coding the
interview responses, we offer a model of desirable JavaScript framework
adoption factors. The factors are grouped into categories that are derived via
the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The factors are
performance expectancy (performance, size), effort expectancy (automatization,
learnability, complexity, understandability), social influence (competitor
analysis, collegial advice, community size, community responsiveness),
facilitating conditions (suitability, updates, modularity, isolation,
extensibility), and price value. A combination of four actors, which are
customer, developer, team, and team leader, leads to the choice. Our model
contributes to the body of knowledge related to the adoption of technology by
software engineers. As a practical implication, our model is useful for
decision makers when evaluating JavaScript frameworks, as well as for
developers for producing desirable frameworks.

tidally disrupted, yielding a sudden injection of gas close to the black hole
horizon which produces an electromagnetic flare. A few dozen of these flares
have been discovered in recent years, but current observations provide poor
constraints on the bolometric luminosity and total accreted mass of these
events. Using images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we
have discovered transient 3.4 micron emission from several previously known
tidal disruption flares. The observations can be explained by dust heated to
its sublimation temperature due to the intense radiation of the tidal flare.
From the break in the infrared light curve we infer that this hot dust is
located ~0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole. Since the dust has been
heated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the
reprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.
For the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity
integrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\times
10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature
of the dust. This bolometric luminosity is a factor ~10 larger than the
observed black body luminosity. Our work is the first to probe dust in the
nuclei of non-active galaxies on sub-parsec scales. The observed infrared
luminosity implies a covering factor ~1% for the nuclear dust in the host
galaxies.

In a similar manner to the stripping of gas by ram pressure, dark matter
self-interactions would transfer momentum between the two galaxy cluster dark
matter haloes, causing them to lag behind the collisionless galaxies. The
absence of an observed separation between the dark matter and stellar
components in the Bullet Cluster has been used to place upper limits on the
cross-section for dark matter scattering. We emphasise the importance of
analysing simulations in an observationally-motivated manner, finding that the
way in which the positions of the various components are measured can have a
larger impact on derived constraints on dark matter's self-interaction
cross-section than reasonable changes to the initial conditions for the merger.
In particular, we find that the methods used in previous studies to place some
of the tightest constraints on this cross-section do not reflect what is done
observationally, and overstate the Bullet Cluster's ability to constrain the
particle properties of dark matter. We introduce the first simulations of the
Bullet Cluster including both self-interacting dark matter and gas. We find
that as the gas is stripped it introduces radially-dependent asymmetries into
the stellar and dark matter distributions. As the techniques used to determine
the positions of the dark matter and galaxies are sensitive to different radial
scales, these asymmetries can lead to erroneously measured offsets between dark
matter and galaxies even when they are spatially coincident.

parameters the resulting dynamics ranges from exact unitarity to arbitrarily
fast decoherence (quantum Zeno effect). For a series of measurements the
effective dynamics includes feedback-control, which for a composite system
yields effective interactions between the subsystems. We quantify the amount of
decoherence accompanying such induced interactions, generalizing the lower
bound found for the gravitational example. However, by allowing multipartite
measurements, we show that interactions can be induced with arbitrarily low
decoherence. These results have implications for gravity-inspired decoherence
models. Moreover, we show how the framework can include terms beyond the usual
second-order approximation, which can spark new quantum control or simulation
protocols. Finally, within our simple approach we re-derive the quantum

versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ (O3N2) diagram in comparison with the local star-forming
galaxy sequence is now well established. The physical origin of the shift is
the subject of some debate, and has important implications for metallicity
measurements based on strong lines at all redshifts. To investigate the origin
of the O3N2 offset, we use a sample of ~100,000 star-forming galaxies from SDSS
DR12 to probe the empirical correlations between emission line diagnostics and
measurable galaxy physical properties. In particular, we examine how surface
density of star formation, ionization parameter, nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O)
ratio, and stellar mass drive position in two key diagnostic diagrams: O3N2 and
[OIII]/H$\beta$ versus [SII]/H$\alpha$ (O3S2). We show that, at fixed
[OIII]/H$\beta$, galaxies falling closer to the high-redshift locus in O3N2
have higher star formation density, stellar mass and N/O ratios. We also find a
tight correspondence in the distributions of stellar mass and N/O in the
diagnostic diagrams. This relation, spanning a range of galaxy evolutionary
states, suggests that the N/O-$M_{*}$ relation is more fundamental than the
N/O-metallicity relation. We argue that a tight N/O-$M_{*}$ relation is
well-motivated physically, and that the observed correlation of N/O with O/H in
the local universe is primarily a reflection of the existence of the
mass-metallicity relation. Because the mass-metallicity relation evolves much
more rapidly with redshift than N/O-$M_{*}$, the N/O ratios of high redshift
galaxies are significantly elevated in comparison with local galaxies with the
same gas-phase O/H. The O3N2 shift and elevated N/O ratios observed in high
redshift galaxies therefore come about as a natural consequence of the
N/O-$M_{*}$ relation combined with the evolution of the mass-metallicity
relation.

non-trivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, abelian and

examples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed
matter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN)
description of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic

naturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary

many-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different
""solution ingredients"" of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in
the TN language, namely: Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana
modes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN
built in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the
model. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both
at zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector. We
also show how the properties of two-point correlation functions follow easily.
Finally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to
a 2d Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The
results in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model,

challenges in solar physics. In this work, I seek to answer a portion of the
mystery by focusing on a particular acceleration process: Alfven waves launched
by the motion of magnetic field footpoints in the photosphere. The entire
corona is threaded with magnetic loops and flux tubes that open up into the
heliosphere. I have sought a better understanding of the role these magnetic
fields play in determining solar wind properties in open flux tubes. After an
introduction of relevant material, I discuss my parameter study of magnetic
field profiles and the statistical understanding we can draw from the resulting
steady-state wind. In the chapter following, I describe how I extended this
work to consider time dependence in the turbulent heating by Alfven waves in
three dimensional simulations. The bursty nature of this heating led to a
natural next step that expands my work to include not only the theoretical, but
also a project to analyze observations of small network jets in the
chromosphere and transition region, and the underlying photospheric magnetic
field that forms thresholds in jet production. In summary, this work takes a
broad look at the extent to which Alfven-wave-driven turbulent heating can

very same data combination is able to set, at $\sim70\%$ CL, an upper limit on

minimal mass expected in the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy scenario. If
high-multipole polarization data from Planck is also considered, the $95\%$ CL

obtained by considering recent measurements of the Hubble parameter. These
limits are obtained assuming a specific non-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum;
they slightly worsen when considering other degenerate neutrino mass schemes.
Current cosmological data, therefore, start to be mildly sensitive to the
neutrino mass ordering. Low-redshift quantities, such as the Hubble constant or
the reionization optical depth, play a very important role when setting the

lying on the edges of two topological Kitaev chains, respectively via couplings
$(t+\Delta)$ and $(\Delta-t)$. This setup enables us to probe MQPs in a quite
distinct way from the zero-bias peak feature. Most importantly, the system
behaves as a current switch made by two distinct paths: (i) for the upper dot
connected to both chains, the device perceives both MQPs as an ordinary fermion
and the current crosses solely the lower dot, since current in the upper dot is
prevented due to the presence of the superconducting gap; and (ii) by
suppressing slightly the hybridization of the upper dot with one chain, the
current is abruptly switched to flow through this dot, once a trapped electron
as a bound state in the continuum (BIC) (Phys. Rev. B 93, 165116 (2016))
appears in the lower dot. Such a current switch between upper and lower dots
characterizes the Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) proposed here, being the ratio
$t/\Delta$ the control parameter of the transition. This QPT is associated with
a change from an ordinary fermionic excitation regime to a MQP in the
interferometer, which enables not only the fundamental revealing of MQPs, but
also yields a current switch assisted by them.

analyze the red, green and blue (RGB) phase-shifting fringe-projection
profilometry technique. The phase-shifted fringe patterns in RGB fringe
projection are typically corrupted by crosstalk because the sensitivity curves
of most projection-recording systems overlap. Crosstalk distortion needs to be
compensated in order to obtain high quality measurements. We study
phase-demodulation methods for null/mild, moderate, and severe levels of RGB
crosstalk. For null/mild crosstalk, we can estimate the searched phase-map
using Bruning's 3-step phase-shifting algorithm (PSA). For moderate crosstalk,
the RGB recorded data is usually preprocessed before feeding it into Bruning's
PSA; alternatively, in this paper we propose a computationally more efficient
approach, which combines crosstalk compensation and phase-demodulation into a
single process. For severe RGB crosstalk, we expect non-sinusoidal fringes'
profiles (distorting harmonics) and significant uncertainties on the crosstalk
calibration (which produces pseudo-detuning error). Analyzing these distorting
phenomena, we conclude that squeezing interferometry is the most robust
demodulation method for RGB fringe-projection techniques. We support our
conclusions with numerical simulations and experimental results.

interact weakly with the surroundings, and to flow with little dissipation or
drag, producing exceptionally long diffusion lengths and relaxation times. In
analogy to Coulomb drag in bilayer two dimensional electron gases, in which the
contribution of the Coulomb interaction to the electric resistivity is studied
by measuring the interlayer resistivity (transresistivity), we predict a
nonlocal drag of magnons in a ferromagnetic bilayer structure based on
semiclassical Boltzmann equations. Nonlocal magnon drag depends on magnetic
dipolar interactions between the layers and manifests in the magnon current
transresistivity and the magnon thermal transresistivity, whereby a magnon
current in one layer induces a chemical potential gradient and/or a temperature
gradient in the other layer. The largest drag effect occurs when the magnon
current flows parallel to the magnetization, however for oblique magnon
currents a large transverse current of magnons emerges. We examine the effect
for practical parameters, and find that the predicted induced temperature
gradient is readily observable.

  Curve",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure in
machine learning. Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from
ranking to biometric screening to medicine, performance is measured not in
terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but in terms of the \emph{partial}
area under the ROC curve between two false positive rates. In this paper, we
develop support vector algorithms for directly optimizing the partial AUC
between any two false positive rates. Our methods are based on minimizing a
suitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error. In the case of
the full AUC, one can readily construct and optimize convex surrogates by
expressing the performance measure as a summation of pairwise terms. The
partial AUC, on the other hand, does not admit such a simple decomposable
structure, making it more challenging to design and optimize (tight) convex
surrogates for this measure.
  Our approach builds on the structural SVM framework of Joachims (2005) to
design convex surrogates for partial AUC, and solves the resulting optimization
problem using a cutting plane solver. Unlike the full AUC, where the
combinatorial optimization needed in each iteration of the cutting plane solver
can be decomposed and solved efficiently, the corresponding problem for the
partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our main contributions is a
polynomial time algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem
associated with partial AUC. We also develop an approach for optimizing a
tighter non-convex hinge loss based surrogate for the partial AUC using
difference-of-convex programming. Our experiments on a variety of real-world
and benchmark tasks confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.

considering noise in the measurement model, by developing a SOC algorithm based
on risk-sensitive control, that includes the dynamics of an observer in such a
way that the control law explicitly depends on the current measurement
uncertainty. In simulation results on a simple 2D manipulator, we have observed
that measurement uncertainty leads to low impedance behaviors, a result in
contrast with the effects of process noise that creates stiff behaviors. This
suggests that taking into account measurement uncertainty could be a

characterize the maximum achievable pre-log factor (degrees of freedom) and the

that for the case where N > 1, the optimal cell association guarantees the
achievability of the maximum uplink rate even when optimizing for the uplink

from the $\Lambda$CDM and the HDE model; this indicates that DE may contain
multiple components. (2) the asymptotic solution of $\Omega_{hde}$ and the
corresponding cosmic fate in a flat universe can be extended to the case of a
non-flat universe; moreover, compared with the case of a flat universe,
considering curvature will make HDE closer to a phantom dark energy. (3)
compared with JLA dataset, SNLS3 data more favor a phantom type HDE; in
contrast, using other types of observational data have no significant impact on
the cosmic evolutions of the $\Lambda$HDE model.

represents one of the most exciting frontiers in astronomy. Since the universe
was filled with hydrogen atoms at early times, the most promising probe of the
epoch of the first stars is the prominent 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen.
Current observational efforts are focused on the cosmic reionization era, but
observations of the pre-reionization cosmic dawn are also promising. While
observationally unexplored, theoretical studies predict a rich variety of
observational signatures from cosmic dawn. As the first stars formed, their
radiation (plus that from stellar remnants) produced significant cosmic events
including Lyman-alpha coupling at z~25, and early X-ray heating. Much focus has
gone to studying the angle-averaged power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations.
Additional probes include the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm spectrum, and the
line-of-sight anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum. A particularly striking
signature may result from the recently recognized effect of a supersonic
relative velocity between the dark matter and gas. Work in this field, focused
on understanding the whole era of reionization and cosmic dawn with analytical
models and numerical simulations, is likely to grow in intensity and
importance, as the theoretical predictions are finally expected to confront
21-cm observations in the coming years. [Abridged]

Based on incomplete data, estimators for bandable and sparse covariance

investigated.
  Minimax rates of convergence are established under the spectral norm loss and
the proposed estimators are shown to be rate-optimal under mild regularity
conditions. Simulation studies demonstrate that the estimators perform well
numerically. The methods are also illustrated through an application to data

wavelengths longward of ~2 {\mu}m. We assess the scientific and technical
benefits of operating such a telescope further into the infrared, with
particular emphasis on the study of exoplanets, which is a major science theme
for ATLAST/LUVOIR. For the study of exoplanet atmospheres, the capability to
work at least out to 5.0 {\mu}m is highly desirable. Such an extension of the
long wavelength limit of ATLAST would greatly increase its capabilities for
studies of exoplanet atmospheres and provide powerful capabilities for the

of using a triangular grid pattern is that it is asymptotically optimal in
terms of the minimum number of robots required for the complete coverage of an
arbitrary bounded area. We use a new topological map which is made and shared
by robots during the search operation. We consider an area that is unknown to
the robots a priori with an arbitrary shape, containing some obstacles. Unlike
many current heuristic algorithms, we give mathematically proofs of convergence
of the algorithms. The computer simulation results for the proposed algorithms
are presented using a simulator of real robots and environment. We evaluate the
performance of the algorithms via experiments with real robots. We compare the
performance of our own algorithms with three existing algorithms from other
researchers. The results demonstrate the merits of our proposed solution. A
further study on formation building with obstacle avoidance for a team of
mobile robots is presented in this report. We propose a decentralized formation
building with obstacle avoidance algorithm for a group of mobile robots to move

complicated formation problem with a group of anonymous robots; these robots
are not aware of their position in the final configuration and need to reach a
consensus during the formation process. We propose a randomized algorithm for

to the increase of unwanted, disruptive information from spammers, malware

spammers do not only annoy users, but also lead to financial loss and privacy
issues. There are two main challenges of spammer detection on Twitter. Firstly,
the data of social network scale with a huge volume of streaming social data.
Secondly, spammers continually change their spamming strategy such as changing
content patterns or trying to gain social influence, disguise themselves as far
as possible. With those challenges, it is hard to directly apply traditional
batch learning methods to quickly adapt newly spamming pattern in the
high-volume and real-time social media data. We need an anti-spammer system to
be able to adjust the learning model when getting a label feedback. Moreover,
the data on social media may be unbounded. Then, the system must allow update
efficiency model in both computation and memory requirements. Online learning
is an ideal solution for this problem. These methods incrementally adapt the
learning model with every single feedback and adjust to the changing patterns
of spammers overtime. Our experiments demonstrate that an anti-spam system

holes in the monolayer and bilayer structures. The analysis clearly elucidates
the crystal orientation dependence manifested through the anisotropic band
structure and the carrier-phonon scattering rates. In the monolayer, the hole
mobility in the armchair direction is estimated to be approximately five times
larger than in the zigzag direction at room temperature (460 cm$^2$/Vs vs. 90
cm$^2$/Vs). The bilayer transport, on the other hand, exhibits a more modest
anisotropy with substantially higher mobilities (1610 cm$^2$/Vs and 760

indicate a comparable dependence while the characteristic values are generally
smaller by about a factor of two. The variation in the saturation velocity is

diminished anisotropy, few-layer phosphorene offers a promising opportunity

  Ham, Chan-Byoung Chae","Frequency Assignment Problem with Net Filter Discrimination Constraints",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Managing radio spectrum resources is a crucial issue. The frequency
assignment problem (FAP) basically aims to allocate, in an efficient manner,
limited number of frequencies to communication links. Geographically close
links, however, cause interference, which complicates the assignment, imposing
frequency separation constraints. The FAP is closely related to the
graph-coloring problem and it is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose
to incorporate the randomization into greedy and fast heuristics. As far as
being implemented, the proposed algorithms are very straight forward and are
without system parameters that need tuned. The proposed algorithms
significantly improve, quickly and effectively, the solutions obtained by
greedy algorithms in terms of the number of assigned frequencies and the range.
The enhanced versions of proposed algorithms perform close to the lower bounds
while running for a reasonable duration. Another novelty of our study is its
consideration of the net filter discrimination effects in the communication
model. Performance analysis is done by synthetic and measured data, where the
measurement data includes the effect of the real 3-dimensional (3D)
geographical features in the Daejeon region in Korea. In both cases, we observe
a significant improvement by employing randomized heuristics.

the DC power flow state estimation problem. The proposed algorithm exploits the
singularity of the impedance matrix and the sparsity of the error vector by
posing the DC power flow problem as a sparse vector recovery problem that
leverages the structure of the power system and uses $l_1$-norm minimization
for state estimation. This approach can provably compute the measurement errors
exactly, and its performance is robust to the arbitrary magnitudes of the
measurement errors. Hence, the proposed approach can detect the noisy elements
if the measurements are contaminated with additive white Gaussian noise plus
sparse noise with large magnitude. The effectiveness of the proposed
sparsity-based decomposition-DC power flow approach is demonstrated on the IEEE

many-to-one stable matching problem, and assume that the true preference lists
of both sides are complete and strict. The lists actually submitted, however,
are truncated. Let I be such a truncated instance. When we apply the
resident-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley to I, the
algorithm produces a set of tentative matches (resident-hospital pairs). We say
that a tentative match in this set is finalizable in I if it is in the
resident-optimal stable matching for every completion of I (a complete instance
of which I is a truncation). We study the problem we call FTM (Finalizability
of Tentative Matches) of deciding if a given tentative match is finalizable in
a given truncated instance. We first show that FTM is coNP-complete, even in
the stable marriage case where the quota of each hospital is restricted to be
1.
  We then introduce and study a special case: we say that a truncated instance
is resident-minimal, if further truncation of the preference lists of the
residents inevitably changes the set of tentative matches. Resident-minimal
instances are not only practically motivated but also useful in natural
backtrack computations for the general case. We give a computationally useful
characterization of negative instances of FTM in this special case, which, for
instance, can be used to formulate an integer program for FTM. For the stable
marriage case, in particular, this characterization yields a polynomial time
algorithm to solve FTM for resident-minimal instances. On the other hand, we
show that FTM remains coNP-complete for resident-minimal instances, if the
maximum quota of the hospitals is 2 or larger.
  We also give a polynomial-time decidable sufficient condition for a tentative
match to be finalizable in the general case.

multi-wavelength unbiased survey of the gas-rich dwarf galaxy populations in
three nearby interacting galaxy groups. The NGC 4725/47 group hosts two tidal
knots and one dIrr. Both tidal knots are located within a prominent HI tidal
tail, appear to have sufficient mass (M_gas~10^8 M_sol) to evolve into
long-lived tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) and are fairly young in age. The NGC
3166/9 group contains a TDG candidate, AGC 208457, at least three dIrrs and
four HI knots. Deep CFHT imaging confirms that the optical component of AGC
208457 is bluer -- with a 0.28 mag g-r colour -- and a few Gyr younger than its
purported parent galaxies. Combining the results for these groups with those
from the NGC 871/6/7 group reported earlier, we find that the HI properties,
estimated stellar ages and baryonic content of the gas-rich dwarfs clearly
distinguish tidal features from their classical counterparts. We optimistically
identify four potentially long-lived tidal objects associated to three separate
pairs of interacting galaxies, implying that TDGs are not readily produced
during interaction events as suggested by some recent simulations. The tidal

At the room temperature, their highest thermal conductance can be comparable

We define the ""oblivious"" and ""non-oblivious"" influence models. We show that
gOLF models are non-oblivious influence models played on a two layered

  Together with OLF models, the Satisfaction measure was introduced and

in the force. In the presence of disorder, it is widely admitted, as well as
experimentally and numerically verified, that the velocity presents a stretched
exponential dependence in the force (the so-called 'creep law'), which is out
of reach of linear response, or more generically of direct perturbative

phenomenology. It provides a justification of the creep law form of the
velocity-force characteristics, in a quasistatic approximation. It allows,
moreover, to capture the non-trivial effects of short-range correlations in the
disorder, which govern the low-temperature asymptotics. It enables us to
establish a phase diagram where the creep law manifests itself in the vicinity

parabolic geometries}, are abelian parabolic geometries whose flat model is an
R-space $G\cdot\mathfrak{p}$ in the infinitesimal isotropy representation
$\mathbb{W}$ of a larger self-dual symmetric R-space $H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$. We
also give a classification of projective parabolic geometries with
$H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$ irreducible which, in addition to the aforementioned
classical geometries, includes a geometry modelled on the Cayley plane
$\mathbb{OP}^2$ and conformal geometries of various signatures.
  The larger R-space $H\cdot\mathfrak{q}$ severely restricts the Lie-algebraic
structure of a projective parabolic geometry. In particular, by exploiting a
Jordan algebra structure on $\mathbb{W}$, we obtain a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-grading on
the Lie algebra of $H$ in which we have tight control over Lie brackets between
various summands. This allows us to generalise known results from the classical
theories. For example, which riemannian metrics are compatible with the
underlying geometry is controlled by the first BGG operator associated to
$\mathbb{W}$.
  In the final chapter, we describe projective parabolic geometries admitting a
$2$-dimensional family of compatible metrics. This is the usual setting for the
classical projective structures; we find that many results which hold in these

developed in low aspect ratio. But under the fraction of this ratio, particles
tend to develop in high aspect ratio. For longer pulse ON time, structures of

iterative solvers, but also as preconditioners for Krylov methods. In practice,
Krylov acceleration is almost always used, since the Krylov method finds a much
better residual polynomial than the stationary iteration, and thus converges
much faster. We show in this paper that also for non-linear problems, domain
decomposition methods can either be used directly as iterative solvers, or one
can use them as preconditioners for Newton's method. For the concrete case of
the parallel Schwarz method, we show that we obtain a preconditioner we call
RASPEN (Restricted Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Exact Newton) which is
similar to ASPIN (Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton), but with all
components directly defined by the iterative method. This has the advantage
that RASPEN already converges when used as an iterative solver, in contrast to
ASPIN, and we thus get a substantially better preconditioner for Newton's
method. The iterative construction also allows us to naturally define a coarse
correction using the multigrid full approximation scheme, which leads to a
convergent two level non-linear iterative domain decomposition method and a two
level RASPEN non-linear preconditioner. We illustrate our findings with
numerical results on the Forchheimer equation and a non-linear diffusion

As a
part of SPIRAL 2 facility, SHIRaC aims to handle and cool typical SPIRAL 2
beams with large emittances (up to 80 pi.mm.mrad) and high currents (up to 1
uA). Its purposes are to enhance as much as possible the beam quality
(transverse geometric emittance of less than 3 pi.mm.mrad and longitudinal
energy spread close to 1 eV) and to transmit more than 60 % of ions.
  Numerical simulations and experimental studies have shown that the required
beam quality can be reached only in term of the emittance. The energy spread is
very far from expected values. It is sensitive to the space charge and the
buffer gas diffusion and more importantly to the RF field derivative effect.
The latter arises at the RFQ exit and increases with the RF parameters (the
frequency and the amplitude of the RF voltage).
  Studies allowing to enhance the cooled beam quality, mainly the energy spread
reduction, are presented and discussed along this paper. They consist in
implementing a miniature RFQ at the RFQ exit. Using this method, it becomes
possible to improve the cooled beam quality and to reach 1 eV of longitudinal
energy spread and around 1.75 {\pi}.mm.mrad of transverse geometric emittance
for beam currents going up to 1 uA.
  The transport of the cooled beam from SHIRaC towards a HRS has been done with
an electrostatic quadrupole triplet. Simulations and first experimental tests
showed that more than 95 % of cooled beams can reach the HRS.
  Finally, developments related to the nuclearization protection methods aiming
to avoid the escape of any nuclear matter from the SHIRaC beamline are studied.

genomes from individuals of the same species when fast random access is
desired. With Kuruppu et al.'s (SPIRE 2010) original implementation, a
reference genome is selected and then the other genomes are greedily parsed
into phrases exactly matching substrings of the reference. Deorowicz and
Grabowski (Bioinformatics, 2011) pointed out that letting each phrase end with
a mismatch character usually gives better compression because many of the
differences between individuals' genomes are single-nucleotide substitutions.
Ferrada et al. (SPIRE 2014) then pointed out that also using relative pointers
and run-length compressing them usually gives even better compression. In this
paper we generalize Ferrada et al.'s idea to handle well also short insertions,
deletions and multi-character substitutions. We show experimentally that our
generalization achieves better compression than Ferrada et al.'s implementation

concepts familiar to researchers in domain decomposition. This allows us to get
a new understanding of MTFs and a natural block Jacobi iteration, for which we
determine optimal relaxation parameters. We then show how iterative multitrace
formulation solvers are related to a well known domain decomposition method
called optimal Schwarz method: a method which used Dirichlet to Neumann maps in
the transmission condition. We finally show that the insight gained from the
simple model problem leads to remarkable identities for Calderon projectors and
related operators, and the convergence results and optimal choice of the
relaxation parameter we obtained is independent of the geometry, the space
dimension of the problem{\color{black}, and the precise form of the spatial
elliptic operator, like for optimal Schwarz methods. We illustrate our analysis

who proved such formulas for smooth functions decades ago. The extension to

results to obtain the large-scale behaviour of the local entropy and the
spatially bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) of thermal equilibrium states of
non-interacting fermions in position space $\mathbb R^d$ ($d\ge 1$) at positive
temperature, $T>0$. In particular, our definition of the thermal EE leads to
estimates that are simultaneously sharp for small $T$ and large scaling
parameter $\alpha>0$ provided that the product $T\alpha$ remains bounded from
below. Here $\alpha$ is the reciprocal quasiclassical parameter. For $d=1$ we
obtain for the thermal EE an asymptotic formula which is consistent with the

accuracy. In this paper, we revisit the issue of SPH kernel and particle
consistency and demonstrate that SPH has a limiting second-order convergence
rate. Numerical experiments with suitably chosen test functions validate this
conclusion. In particular, we find that when using the root mean square error
as a model evaluation statistics, well-known corrective SPH schemes, which were
thought to converge to second, or even higher order, are actually first-order
accurate, or at best close to second order. We also find that observing the
joint limit when $N\to\infty$, $h\to 0$, and $n\to\infty$, as was recently
proposed by Zhu et al., where $N$ is the total number of particles, $h$ is the
smoothing length, and $n$ is the number of neighbor particles, standard SPH
restores full $C^{0}$ particle consistency for both the estimates of the
function and its derivatives and becomes insensitive to particle disorder.

Navier--Stokes equation, we show how the Poincar\'e--Riemann--Hilbert
boundary-value problem enables us to construct effective estimates of solutions
for this case. The apparatus of the three-dimensional inverse problem of
quantum scattering theory is developed for this. It is shown that the unitary
scattering operator can be studied as a solution of the
Poincar\'e--Riemann--Hilbert boundary-value problem. The same scheme of
reduction of Riemann integral equations for the zeta function to the
Poincar\'e--Riemann--Hilbert boundary-value problem allows us to construct
effective estimates that describe the behaviour of the zeros of the zeta
function very well.

of inter-conversion of matter and dark energy, in the framework of Brans-Dicke
theory. An empirical scale factor has been used, which generates a signature
flip of the deceleration parameter with time. To account for the
non-conservation of matter, a function of time f(t) is incorporated into the
equation representing the density of matter. Its value at any instant of time
is proportional to the matter content of the universe. The functional form of
f(t) has been determined from the field equations by using an empirical scalar
field parameter expressed in terms of the scale factor. It is found to decrease
with time almost monotonically, implying a conversion of matter into dark
energy. Using this function f(t), the time variation of the density of matter
has been determined and also the expressions regarding the proportions of
matter and dark energy of the universe have been formulated. Time variation of
gravitational constant, its fractional rate of change and the Brans-Dicke
dimensionless parameter has been analyzed. The dependence of Brans-Dicke
parameter upon the scalar field has been determined. The present study enables
us to correlate the change of matter content with the change of deceleration
parameter and gravitational constant without using any specific mechanism of
interaction between matter and scalar field.

suggest a discord between quantum theory and special relativity. We propose a
resolution for this discord by first observing that there is a problem of time
in quantum theory. There should exist a reformulation of quantum theory which
does not refer to classical time. Such a reformulation is obtained by
suggesting that space-time is fundamentally non-commutative. Quantum theory
without classical time is the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of the
underlying non-commutative relativity. Stochastic fluctuations about
equilibrium give rise to the classical limit and ordinary space-time geometry.
However, measurement on an entangled state can be correctly described only in
the underlying non-commutative space-time, where there is no causality
violation, nor a spooky action at a distance.

(passive) polymeric cylinder with an ultrasonic hysteresis-type absorption
submerged in a non-viscous fluid requires that the absorption efficiency is
positive (Qabs > 0) satisfying the law of the conservation of energy. This
condition imposes restrictions on the values attributed to the normalized
absorption coefficients for the compressional and shear-wave wavenumbers for
each partial-wave mode n. The forbidden values produce negative axial radiation
force, absorption and extinction efficiencies, as well as an enhancement of the
scattering efficiency, not in agreement with the conservation of energy law.
Numerical results for the radiation force, extinction, absorption and
scattering efficiencies are performed for three viscoelastic (VE) polymer
cylinders immersed in a non-viscous host liquid (i.e. water) with particular
emphasis on the shear-wave absorption coefficient of the cylinder, the
dimensionless size parameter and the partial-wave mode number n. Mathematical
constraints are established for the non-dimensional absorption coefficients of
the longitudinal and shear waves for a cylinder (i.e. 2D case) and a sphere
(i.e. 3D case) in terms of the sound velocities in the VE material. The
analysis suggests that the domain of validity for any viscoelastic model
describing acoustic attenuation inside a lossy cylinder (or sphere) in a
non-viscous fluid must be verified based upon the optical theorem.
