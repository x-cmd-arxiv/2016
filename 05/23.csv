command-line utility, written in C, for analyzing astronomical time-series
data, especially light curves. The program provides a general-purpose set of
tools for processing light curves including signal identification, filtering,
light curve manipulation, time conversions, and modeling and simulating light
curves. Some of the routines implemented include the Generalized Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, the Box-Least Squares transit search routine, the Analysis of
Variance periodogram, the Discrete Fourier Transform including the CLEAN
algorithm, the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform, light curve arithmetic, linear and
non-linear optimization of analytic functions including support for Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analyses with non-trivial covariances, characterizing and/or
simulating time-correlated noise, and the TFA and SYSREM filtering algorithms,
among others. A mechanism is also provided for incorporating a user's own
compiled processing routines into the program. VARTOOLS is designed especially
for batch processing of light curves, including built-in support for parallel
processing, making it useful for large time-domain surveys such as searches for
transiting planets. Several examples are provided to illustrate the use of the
program.

a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Many variations of this problem
have been studied, for example, in the context of proof labeling schemes (PLS),
locally checkable proofs (LCP), and non-deterministic local decision (NLD). In
all of these contexts, verification time is assumed to be constant. Korman,
Kutten and Masuzawa [PODC 2011] presented a proof-labeling scheme for MST, with
poly-logarithmic verification time, and logarithmic memory at each vertex.
  In this paper we introduce the notion of a $t$-PLS, which allows the
verification procedure to run for super-constant time. Our work analyzes the
tradeoffs of $t$-PLS between time, label size, message length, and computation
space. We construct a universal $t$-PLS and prove that it uses the same amount
of total communication as a known one-round universal PLS, and $t$ factor
smaller labels. In addition, we provide a general technique to prove lower
bounds for space-time tradeoffs of $t$-PLS. We use this technique to show an
optimal tradeoff for testing that a network is acyclic (cycle free). Our
optimal $t$-PLS for acyclicity uses label size and computation space $O((\log
n)/t)$. We further describe a recursive $O(\log^* n)$ space verifier for
acyclicity which does not assume previous knowledge of the run-time $t$.

superconducting properties of materials. Recent experiments have demonstrated
that the metamaterial approach is capable of achieving this goal, such as
tripling the critical temperature Tc in Al-Al2O3 epsilon near zero (ENZ)
core-shell metamaterial superconductors. However, transport properties of such
metamaterials remained much worse compared to conventional superconductors.
Here, we demonstrate that an Al/Al2O3 hyperbolic metamaterial geometry is
capable of a similar Tc enhancement, while having superior transport and
magnetic properties compared to the core-shell metamaterial superconductors.
This result opens up numerous new possibilities for metamaterial enhancement of
Tc in other practically important simple superconductors, such as niobium and
MgB2. It also indicates that the recently discovered hyperbolic properties of
high Tc superconductors may play considerable role in superconductivity
enhancement in cuprates.

rapidly with the number and dimensions of the images to be processed. Several
fields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images,
which might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all adding
to the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method of
increasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolution
approach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentation
starts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps.
The starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily with
no clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed that
starting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in different
accuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category
(depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolution
selection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces a
framework for the automated selection of the best resolution for image
segmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based on
user/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computation
time. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of the
resolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previously
determined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution)
distribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the data
difficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two different
segmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learning
enable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining at
least the original accuracy.

design the interconnections between the nodes of two different networks $G_1$

setting, each player is associated with a node in $G_1$ and has functional
dependencies on certain nodes in $G_2$. We use a distance-based utility for the
players in which the goal of each player is to purchase a set of edges
(incident to its associated node) such that the sum of the distances between
its associated node and the nodes it depends on in $G_2$ is minimized. We
consider a heterogeneous set of players (i.e., players have their own costs and
benefits for constructing edges). We show that finding a best response of a
player in this game is NP-hard. Despite this, we characterize some properties
of the best response actions which are helpful in determining a Nash
equilibrium for certain instances of this game. In particular, we prove
existence of pure Nash equilibria in this game when $G_2$ contains a star

electronic devices. Here we show that the first-order metamagnetic phase
transition in FeRh films becomes strongly asymmetric in mesoscale structures.
In patterned FeRh stripes we observed pronounced supercooling and an
avalanche-like abrupt transition from the ferromagnetic to the
antiferromagnetic phase while the reverse transition remains nearly continuous
over a broad temperature range. Although modest asymmetry signatures have been
found in FeRh films, the effect is dramatically enhanced at the mesoscale. The
asymmetry in the transitions is independent of applied magnetic fields and the
activation volume of the antiferromagnetic phase is more than two orders of
magnitude larger than typical magnetic heterogeneities observed in films. The
collective behavior upon cooling results from the role of long-range
ferromagnetic exchange correlations that become important at the mesoscale and
should be a general property of first-order magnetic phase transitions.

distinguished from trivial insulators by the presence of nontrivial conducting

all the TIs discovered experimentally rely on the presence of either time
reversal or symmorphic mirror symmetry to protect massless Dirac-like boundary
states. Very recently, it has been theoretically proposed that several
materials are a new type of TIs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry, where
glide-mirror can protect novel exotic surface fermions with hourglass-shaped
dispersion. However, an experimental confirmation of such new nonsymmorphic TI
(NSTI) is still missing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
reveal that such hourglass topology exists on the (010) surface of crystalline
KHgSb while the (001) surface has no boundary state, which is fully consistent
with first-principles calculations. We thus experimentally demonstrate that
KHgSb is a NSTI hosting hourglass fermions. By expanding the classification of
topological insulators, this discovery opens a new direction in the research of
nonsymmorphic topological properties of materials.

interest. These materials give rise to condensed matter realizations of many
important concepts in high-energy physics, leading to wide-ranging protected
properties in transport and spectroscopic experiments. The most studied TMs,
i.e., Weyl and Dirac semimetals, feature quasiparticles that are direct
analogues of the textbook elementary particles. Moreover, the TMs known so far
can be characterized based on the dimensionality of the band crossing. While
Weyl and Dirac semimetals feature zero-dimensional points, the band crossing of
nodal-line semimetals forms a one-dimensional closed loop. In this paper, we
identify a TM which breaks the above paradigms. Firstly, the TM features
triply-degenerate band crossing in a symmorphic lattice, hence realizing
emergent fermionic quasiparticles not present in quantum field theory.
Secondly, the band crossing is neither 0D nor 1D. Instead, it consists of two
isolated triply-degenerate nodes interconnected by multi-segments of lines with
two-fold degeneracy. We present materials candidates. We further show that
triplydegenerate band crossings in symmorphic crystals give rise to a Landau
level spectrum distinct from the known TMs, suggesting novel magneto-transport
responses. Our results open the door for realizing new topological phenomena

state of the initial system, and notice some interesting features. We also
observe the behaviour of the net quantum correlation as we continuously
increase the interaction time, for the general state of N two-level atoms in a

Functional mapping, which is aimed at mapping genes that affect developmental
patterns, is instrumental for studying the genetic architecture of biological
changes. Often biological processes are mediated by a network of developmental
and physiological components and, therefore, are better described by multiple
phenotypes. In this article, we develop a multivariate model for functional
mapping that can detect and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that
simultaneously control multiple dynamic traits. Because the true genotypes of
QTLs are unknown, the measurements for the multiple dynamic traits are modeled
using a mixture distribution. The functional means of the multiple dynamic
traits are estimated using the nonparametric regression method, which avoids
any parametric assumption on the functional means. We propose the profile
likelihood method to estimate the mixture model. A likelihood ratio test is
exploited to test for the existence of pleiotropic effects on distinct but
developmentally correlated traits. A simulation study is implemented to
illustrate the finite sample performance of our proposed method. We also
demonstrate our method by identifying QTLs that simultaneously control three
dynamic traits of soybeans. The three dynamic traits are the time-course
biomass of the leaf, the stem, and the root of the whole soybean. The genetic

instability of small finite data samples, we repeatedly subsample the data and
select those substructures (from the optimal models) that are both stable and
parsimonious. These substructures can be visualized through a causal graph. Our

corrections to the asymptotic critical behavior in terms of non universal

critical transition temperature for one-, two- and three-dimensional samples
are found taking into account the fact that fluctuations occur at all length
scales as the critical point of a system is approached. The GL model in the
free-field approximation and the 3D-XY model are suitable for describing the
weak and strong fluctuation regimes respectively. However, with a modified
quadratic coefficient, the renormalized GL model is able to explain certain
experimental observations including the specific heat of complicated systems,
such as the cuprate superconductors and the $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides. It is
clearly shown that the enhancement, suppression or rounding of the specific

shared memory over an asynchronous, distributed message passing system.
Previous literature has developed several shared memory emulation algorithms
based on replication and erasure coding techniques. In this paper, we present
information-theoretic lower bounds on the storage costs incurred by shared
memory emulation algorithms. Our storage cost lower bounds are universally
applicable, that is, we make no assumption on the structure of the algorithm or
the method of encoding the data.
  We consider an arbitrary algorithm $A$ that implements an atomic multi-writer
single-reader (MWSR) shared memory variable whose values come from a finite set
$\mathcal{V}$ over a system of $N$ servers connected by point-to-point
asynchronous links. We require that in every fair execution of algorithm $A$
where the number of server failures is smaller than a parameter $f$, every
operation invoked at a non-failing client terminates. We define the storage
cost of a server in algorithm $A$ as the logarithm (to base 2) of number of
states it can take on; the total-storage cost of algorithm $A$ is the sum of
the storage cost of all servers.
  Our results are as follows. (i) We show that if algorithm $A$ does not use
server gossip, then the total storage cost is lower bounded by $2
\frac{N}{N-f+1}\log_2|\mathcal{V}|-o(\log_2|\mathcal{V}|)$. (ii) The total
storage cost is at least $2 \frac{N}{N-f+2}
\log_{2}|\mathcal{V}|-o(\log_{2}|\mathcal{V}|)$ even if the algorithm uses
server gossip. (iii) We consider algorithms where the write protocol sends
information about the value in at most one phase. We show that the total
storage cost is at least $\nu^* \frac{N}{N-f+\nu^*-1} \log_2( |\mathcal{V}|)-
o(\log_2(|\mathcal{V}|),$ where $\nu^*$ is the minimum of $f+1$ and the number

To appear in SICOMP 2020",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The greedy spanner is arguably the simplest and most well-studied spanner
construction. Experimental results demonstrate that it is at least as good as
any other spanner construction, in terms of both the size and weight
parameters. However, a rigorous proof for this statement has remained elusive.
  In this work we fill in the theoretical gap via a surprisingly simple
observation: The greedy spanner is \emph{existentially optimal} (or
existentially near-optimal) for several important graph families, in terms of
both the size and weight. Roughly speaking, the greedy spanner is said to be
existentially optimal (or near-optimal) for a graph family $\mathcal G$ if the
worst performance of the greedy spanner over all graphs in $\mathcal G$ is just
as good (or nearly as good) as the worst performance of an optimal spanner over
all graphs in $\mathcal G$.
  Focusing on the weight parameter, the state-of-the-art spanner constructions
for both general graphs (due to Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA'16]) and
doubling metrics (due to Gottlieb [FOCS'15]) are complex. Plugging our
observation on these results, we conclude that the greedy spanner achieves
near-optimal weight guarantees for both general graphs and doubling metrics,
thus resolving two longstanding conjectures in the area.
  Further, we observe that approximate-greedy spanners are existentially
near-optimal as well. Consequently, we provide an $O(n \log n)$-time
construction of $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners for doubling metrics with constant
lightness and degree. Our construction improves Gottlieb's construction, whose
runtime is $O(n \log^2 n)$ and whose number of edges and degree are unbounded,
and remarkably, it matches the state-of-the-art Euclidean result (due to

due to the added time dimension in search space. In approaches that ignore the
time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is
unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally
sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness,
it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of
adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion
planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the
context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the
idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic
environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model.
Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions
of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a
low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete
and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost
sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of
3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show
that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over
4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates
significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.

ultra-heterogeneous graphs. It iteratively assists users in query graph
construction by making suggestions via machine learning methods. In its active
mode, Orion automatically suggests top-k edges to be added to a query graph. In
its passive mode, the user adds a new edge manually, and Orion suggests a
ranked list of labels for the edge. Orion's edge ranking algorithm, Random
Decision Paths (RDP), makes use of a query log to rank candidate edges by how
likely they will match the user's query intent. Extensive user studies using
Freebase demonstrated that Orion users have a 70% success rate in constructing
complex query graphs, a significant improvement over the 58% success rate by
the users of a baseline system that resembles existing visual query builders.
Furthermore, using active mode only, the RDP algorithm was compared with
several methods adapting other machine learning algorithms such as random
forests and naive Bayes classifier, as well as class association rules and
recommendation systems based on singular value decomposition. On average, RDP
required 40 suggestions to correctly reach a target query graph (using only its

structure accompanies the ferromagnetic transition in the system of magnetic
dopants. Experimentally, the QAH transition manifests itself as a jump in the
dependence of longitudinal resistivity on a weak external magnetic field.
Microscopically, this jump originates from the emergence of a chiral edge mode
on one side of the ferromagnetic transition. We study analytically the effect
of an extended confinement on the structure of the edge modes. We employ the
simplest model of the extended confinement in the form of potential step next
to the hard wall. It is shown that, unlike the conventional quantum Hall
effect, where all edge channels are chiral, in QAH effect, a complex structure
of the boundary leads to nonchiral edge modes which are present on both sides
of the ferromagnetic transition. Wave functions of nonchiral modes are
different above and below the transition: on the ""topological"" side, where the
chiral edge mode is supported, nonchiral modes are ""repelled"" from the
boundary, i.e. they are much less localized than on the ""trivial"" side. Thus,
the disorder-induced scattering into these modes will boost the extension of
the chiral edge mode. The prime experimental manifestation of nonchiral modes
is that, by contributing to longitudinal resistance, they smear the QAH
transition.

stratified flows has been studied by analyzing the non-hydrostatic inviscid
Boussinesq equations. We have focused on a widely-used model of geophysical and
astrophysical vortices, which assumes an axisymmetric Gaussian structure for
pressure anomalies in the horizontal and vertical directions. For a range of
Rossby number ($-0.5 < Ro < 0.5$) and Burger number ($0.02 < Bu < 2.3$)
relevant to observed long-lived vortices, the growth rate and spatial structure
of the most unstable eigenmodes have been numerically calculated and presented
as a function of $Ro-Bu$. We have found neutrally-stable vortices only over a
small region of the $Ro-Bu$ parameter space: cyclones with $Ro \sim 0.02-0.05$
and $Bu \sim 0.85-0.95$. However, we have also found that anticyclones in
general have slower growth rates compared to cyclones. In particular, the
growth rate of the most unstable eigenmode for anticyclones in a large region
of the parameter space (e.g., $Ro<0$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$) is
slower than $50$ turn-around times of the vortex (which often corresponds to
several years for ocean eddies). For cyclones, the region with such slow growth
rates is confined to $0<Ro<0.1$ and $0.5 \lesssim Bu \lesssim 1.3$. While most
calculations have been done for $f/\bar{N}=0.1$ (where $f$ and $\bar{N}$ are
the Coriolis and background Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequencies), we have
numerically verified and explained analytically, using non-dimensionalized
equations, the insensitivity of the results to reducing $f/\bar{N}$ to the more
ocean-relevant value of $0.01$. The results of this paper provide a
steppingstone to study the more complicated problems of the stability of
geophysical (e.g., those in the atmospheres of giant planets) and astrophysical
vortices (in accretion disks).

sparse coefficients describing a locally linear 3D structural interpolation
reveal the local sequencing information. Our formulation optimizes a biconvex
cost function that leverages a compressed sensing formulation and enforces both
structural dependency coherence across video streams, as well as motion
smoothness across estimates from common video sources. We further analyze the

introducing an approach for heuristic-based plan generation, as well as a
mechanism to detect cardinality estimation error at runtime, ROSIE relieves the

structured in a hierarchical fashion, our model is state-extended ground-tree
rewrite systems equipped with shared unbounded integer counters that can be
incremented, decremented, and compared against an integer constant. Since the
model is Turing-complete, we propose a decidable underapproximation. First,
using a restriction similar to context-bounding, we underapproximate the global
control by a weak global control (i.e. DAGs possibly with self-loops), thereby
limiting the number of synchronisations between different threads. Second, we
bound the number of reversals between non-decrementing and non-incrementing
modes of the counters. Under this restriction, we show that reachability
becomes NP-complete. In fact, it is poly-time reducible to satisfaction over
existential Presburger formulas, which allows one to tap into highly optimised
SMT solvers. Our decidable approximation strictly generalises known decidable
models including (i) weakly-synchronised ground-tree rewrite systems, and (ii)
synchronisation/reversal-bounded concurrent pushdown systems systems with
counters. Finally, we show that, when equipped with reversal-bounded counters,
relaxing the weak control restriction by the notion of senescence results in

$m_e$ is determined from the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. In certain

FFT spectrum suggesting a possible lifting of the double degeneracy in accord
with the helical spin texture at outer and inner Fermi surfaces with opposite

uncovered over a wide temperature range in needle crystal of $\rm Cd_3As_2$

luminosity of $\sim0.3-4.4$ L$_{\odot}$. The other six cores are found to
remain as starless and probably are in a dynamically transitional state. The
temperature maps produced using multi-wavelength images show an enhancement of
about 3-6 K towards the outer boundary of these cores, suggesting that they are
most likely being heated externally by nearby stars and/or interstellar
radiation fields. Large virial parameters and an over-dominance of red
asymmetric line profiles over the cores may indicate that the cores are set
into either an expansion or an oscillatory motion, probably due to the external
heating. Most of the starless cores show coreshine effect due to the scattering
of light by the micron-size dust grains. This may imply that the age of the
cores is of the order of $\sim10^{5}$ years, being consistent with the
timescale required for the cores to evolve into an oscillatory stage due to the
external perturbation. Our observational results support the idea that the
external feedback from nearby stars and/or interstellar radiation fields may
play an important role in the dynamical evolution of the cores.

aggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but
connecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has
traditionally been difficult. Manifestations of homophily, the notion that
individuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed
in many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior
translates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be,
remains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the
population dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a
macroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela,
a 3-month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61
million people, making it the largest gathering in the history of humanity.
While we find strong overall evidence for both types of homophily for residents
of different states, participants from low-representation states show
considerably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than
those from high-representation states. These manifestations of homophily are
amplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we
estimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that
homophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales

hyperbolic KM algebras with symmetric Cartan matrices,
$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -a \\ -a & 2 \\ \end{array}\right], a\geq 3$.
The case when $a=3$ is called $\mathcal{F}ib$ because of its connection with
the Fibonacci numbers (Feingold 1980). Some important structural results about
$\mathcal{F}$ come from the decomposition with respect to its affine subalgebra
$A^{(1)}_1$. Here we study the decomposition of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to
its subalgebra $\mathcal{F}ib$. We find that $\mathcal{F}$ has a grading by
$\mathcal{F}ib$-level, and prove that each graded piece, $\mathcal{F}ib(m)$ for
$m\in\mathbb{Z}$, is an integrable $\mathcal{F}ib$-module. We show that for
$|m|>2$, $\mathcal{F}ib(m)$ completely reduces as a direct sum of highest- and
lowest-weight modules, and for $|m|\leq 2$, $\mathcal{F}ib(m)$ contains one
irreducible non-standard quotient module $V^{\Lambda_m}=V(m)\Big/U(m)$. We then
prove that the quotient $\mathcal{F}ib(m)\Big/V(m)$ completely reduces as a
direct sum of one trivial module (on level 0), and standard modules. We give an
algorithm for determining the inner multiplicities of any irreducible
$\mathcal{F}ib$-module, in particular the non-standard modules on levels
$|m|\leq 2$. We show that multiplicities of non-standard modules on levels
$|m|=1,2$ do not follow the Kac-Peterson recursion, but instead appear to
follow a recursion similar to Racah-Speiser. We then use results of Borcherds

light and measurement scheme. This procedure makes use of the celebrated
statistical principle of maximum likelihood, along with other validation tools,
to grow an appropriate seed subspace into the optimal reconstruction subspace,
much like the nucleation of a seed into a crystal. Apart from using the

nuclides, especially at the Z = 12, N = 12, should be associated with an
octahedral deformed shape. Within the framework of molecular geometrical
symmetry, we find a possibility that the Z = 12, N = 12 system would form an
octahedral structure consisting of six points of alpha(4He) particles, yielding
the ground collectivity. With this point of view, we draw the following serial
molecular structures; the Z = 10, N = 10, 20Ne, corresponds to a hexahedral,
the Z = 8, N = 8, 16O, does to a tetrahedral, and the Z = 6, N = 6, 12C, does
to a trigonal symmetry. Moreover, the Z = 2, N = 2, 4He(alpha), fits into a
tetrahedral symmetry with four points of nucleons; two protons and two
neutrons. The enhanced deformation at Z = 12 with N > 20 would be explained by
a deformed shape related to an Ethene(Ethylene)-like skeleton with six alpha
particles. The deformation at Z = 10, with N = 10 and 12, can be interpreted as
being attributed to a hexahedral shape combined by five alpha particles as
well. By noticing that the Z = 4, N = 4 system is unstable to the ground state
under two-body system with two alpha particles, we conclude that alpha
particles, rather than the eight-protons-neutrons nucleon, govern the 8Be
stability. Accordingly, the alpha particle should be a third nucleon, like a
proton or a neutron, in a nucleus. We name it the 'Alpharon'. With this
picture, we are able to open a new gate toward understanding of nuclear
many-body systems; nucleon-nucleon interaction, shell structures,
nucleon-synthesis, and nuclear matters. We argue that nature favors three-body
systems; three quarks for a nucleon, three nucleons for a nucleus.

shrinking balls under iteration generated by a large general class of dynamical
systems called weakly Markov. Our ultimate main result is that these
distributions converge to the exponential law when the balls shrink to points.
We apply this result to many classes of smooth dynamical systems that include
conformal iterated function systems, rational functions on the Riemann sphere
$\widehat{\mathbb C}$, and transcendental meromorphic functions on the complex
plane $\mathbb{C}$. We also apply them to expanding repellers and holomorphic
endomorphisms of complex projective spaces.
  One of the key ingredients in our approach is to solve the well known, in
this field of mathematics, problem of appropriately estimating the measures of,
suitably defined, large class of geometric annuli. We successfully do it. This
problem is, in the existing literature, differently referred to by different
authors; we call it the Thick Thin Annuli Property.
  Having this property established, we prove that for non--conformal systems
the aforementioned distributions converge to the exponential one along sets of
radii whose relative Lebesgue measure converges fast to one.
  But this is not all. In the context of conformal iterated function systems,
we establish the Full Thin Annuli Property, which gives the same estimates for
all radii. ln this way, we solve a long standing problem. As a result, we prove
that the convergence to the exponential law holds along all radii for
essentially all conformal iterated function systems and, with the help of the
techniques of first return maps, for all aforementioned conformal dynamical
systems.

systems with a large number of storage nodes. A pivotal recovery metric upon
the failure of a storage node is repair bandwidth cost which refers to the
amount of data that must be downloaded for regenerating the lost data. Since
all the surviving nodes are not always accessible, we intend to introduce a
class of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that can be re-used when the
number of selected nodes varies yet yields close to optimal repair bandwidth.
Such codes provide flexibility in engaging more surviving nodes in favor of
reducing the repair bandwidth without redesigning the code structure and
changing the content of the existing nodes. We call this property of MDS codes
progressive engagement. This name comes from the fact that if a failure occurs,
it is shown that the best strategy is to incrementally engage the surviving
nodes according to their accessing cost (delay, number of hops, traffic load or
availability in general) until the repair-bandwidth or accessing cost
constraints are met. We argue that the existing MDS codes fail to satisfy the
progressive engagement property. We subsequently present a search algorithm to
find a new set of codes named rotation codes that has both progressive
engagement and MDS properties. Furthermore, we illustrate how the existing
permutation codes can provide progressive engagement by modifying the original
recovery scheme. Simulation results are presented to compare the repair
bandwidth performance of such codes when the number of participating nodes
varies as well as their speed of single failure recovery.

We are interested in interacting subsystems of this form, which we model by a

Specifically, we study the structure learning problem for spatially distributed
dynamical systems coupled via a directed acyclic graph. Unlike established
structure learning procedures that find locally maximum posterior probabilities
of a network structure containing latent variables, our work exploits the
properties of dynamical systems to compute globally optimal approximations of
these distributions. We arrive at this result by the use of time delay
embedding theorems. Taking an information-theoretic perspective, we show that
the log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation in terms of information
transfer.

an influence on the intrinsic detector resolution of GEMs via suppression of

a neon based mixture, whereas other gases provided an intrinsic detector
resolution closer to 1, meaning a multiplication distribution closer to the

scheduling, routing, packing, bioinformatics, and many more. Despite recent
advances in developing scalable solvers, there are still many problems which
are often very hard to solve. Typically the most advanced solvers include
elements which are stochastic in nature. If a same instance is solved many
times using different seeds then depending on the inherent characteristics of a
problem instance and the solver, one can observe a highly-variant distribution
of times spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore, to solve a problem
instance efficiently it is often useful to solve the same instance in parallel
with different seeds. With the proliferation of cloud computing, it is natural
to think about an elastic solver which can scale up by launching searches in
parallel on thousands of machines (or cores). However, this could result in
consuming a lot of energy. Moreover, not every instance would require thousands
of machines. The challenge is to resolve the tradeoff between solution time and
energy consumption optimally for a given problem instance. We analyse the
impact of the number of machines (or cores) on not only solution time but also
on energy consumption. We highlight that although solution time always drops as
the number of machines increases, the relation between the number of machines
and energy consumption is more complicated. In many cases, the optimal energy
consumption may be achieved by a middle ground, we analyse this relationship in
detail. The tradeoff between solution time and energy consumption is studied
further, showing that the energy consumption of a solver can be reduced
drastically if we increase the solution time marginally. We also develop a
prediction model, demonstrating that such insights can be exploited to achieve
faster solutions times in a more energy efficient manor.

ELODIE radial velocities to search for the existence of orbiting companions to
HD219828. A dynamical analysis is also performed to study the stability of the
system and to constrain the orbital parameters and planet masses. We announce
the discovery of a long period (P=13.1years) massive (msini=15.1MJup) companion
(HD219828c) in a very eccentric orbit (e=0.81). The same data confirms the
existence of a hot-neptune, HD219828b, with a minimum mass of 21 MEarth and a
period of 3.83days. The dynamical analysis shows that the system is stable. The
HD219828 system is extreme and unique in several aspects. First, among all
known exoplanet systems it presents an unusually high mass ratio. We also show
that systems like HD219828, with a hot neptune and a long-period massive
companion are more frequent than similar systems with a hot jupiter instead.
This suggests that the formation of hot neptunes follows a different path than
the formation of their hot jovian counterparts. The high mass, long period, and
eccentricity of HD219828c also make it a good target for Gaia astrometry as
well as a potential target for atmospheric characterisation, using direct
imaging or high-resolution spectroscopy. Astrometric observations will allow us
to derive its real mass and orbital configuration. If a transit of HD219828b is
detected, we will be able to fully characterise the system, including the
relative orbital inclinations. With a clearly known mass, HD219828c may become
a benchmark object for the range in between giant planets and brown dwarfs.

and sufficiently low temperature there is a spontaneous breaking of the
circular symmetry between colors and a phase transition forwards a
ferromagnet-like phase. Our second main result concerns 5-circular coloring of
random 3-regular graphs. While this case is found colorable, we conclude that
the description via one-step replica symmetry breaking is not sufficient. We
observe that simulated annealing is very efficient to find proper colorings for

fractality of crumpled damaged graphene. Pristine graphene membranes are
damaged by adding random vacancies and carbon-hydrogen bonds. Crumpled
membranes exhibit a fractal dimension of $ 2.71 \pm 0.02$ when all interactions
between carbon atoms are considered, and $2.30 \pm 0.05$ when non-covalent
interactions are suppressed. The transition between these two values, obtained
by switching on/off the non-covalent interactions of equilibrium
configurations, is shown to be reversible and independent on thermalisation. In
order to explain this transition, we propose a theoretical model that is
compatible with our numerical findings. Finally, we also compare damaged
graphene membranes with other crumpled structures, as for instance, polymerised
membranes and paper sheets, that share similar scaling properties.

character, first is of itinerant nature located very close to the Fermi level,
and second, is of less itinerant (relatively localized character), located
beyond 2 eV below the Fermi level. These distinct states are clearly
distinguishable in the resonant photoemission data. Comparison between the
results obtained from experiments and first principle based electronic
structure calculation show that the origin of the itinerant character of the Fe
3d states is due to the ordered B2 structure, whereas the relatively less
itinerant (localized) Fe 3d states are from the disorders present in the
sample. The exchange splitting of the Fe 3s core level peak confirms the
presence of local moment in this system. It is found that the itinerant
electrons arise due to the hybridization between Fe 3d and Al 3s-3p states.
Presence of hybridization is observed as a shift in the Al 2p core-level
spectra as well as in the X-ray near edge absorption spectra towards lower
binding energy. Our photoemission results are thus explained by the
co-existence of ordered and disordered phases in the system.

estimated using ""Milne's device"" by comparing the result from two different
methods in a predictor-corrector pair. Using a predictor-corrector pair the
expensive part of the procedure, the solution of the velocity and pressure
equations, is performed only once per time step and an estimate of the local
error is easily obtained. The stability of the numerical solution is maintained
and the accuracy is controlled by keeping the local error below a given
threshold using PI-control. Depending on the threshold, the time step $\Delta
t$ is bound by stability requirements or accuracy requirements. Our method
takes a shorter $\Delta t$ than an implicit method but with less work in each
time step and the solver is simpler. The method is analyzed theoretically with
respect to stability and applied to the simulation of a 2D ice slab and a 3D
circular ice sheet. %The automatically chosen $\Delta t$ is either restricted
by accuracy or stability depedning on an error tolerance. The stability bounds
in the experiments are explained by and agree well with the theoretical
results.

are applicable. The stochastic Galerkin method yields a larger linear dynamical
system, whose solution approximates the unknown coefficients in the expansions.
The Hardy norms of the transfer function provide information about the
input-output behaviour of the Galerkin system. We investigate two approaches to
construct a sparse representation of the quantity of interest, where just a low
number of coefficients is non-zero. Firstly, a standard basis is reduced by the
omission of basis functions, whose accompanying Hardy norms are relatively
small. Secondly, a projection-based model order reduction is applied to the
Galerkin system and allows for the definition of new basis functions as a
sparse representation. In both cases, we prove error bounds on the sparse

  galaxies","14 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper is a brief overview of the works by Iosif S. Shklovsky
(1916--1985), carried out over almost 30 years (1955--1985), on the nature of
activity (primarily in the radio frequency range) in nuclei of some galaxies.
  Worthy of note is Shklovsky's pioneering work of 1962, in which he made an
attempt to consider possible evolutionary tracks of extragalactic radio sources
by constructing an analog of the Herzsprung--Russel diagram for stars (radio
luminosity at 160 MHz was taken instead of optical luminosity; total radio size
at the same frequency, as the other parameter). Later works by other authors
are also discussed, where similar diagrams were plotted using a larger
observational material.
  Special attention is paid to the evolution of Shklovsky's views regarding the
possible ways of gas getting into radio galaxies' central regions, followed by
high-velocity ejections of magnetized plasmons from their nuclei. In his
assumptions, Shklovsky was mainly based on the observational data for the
properties of the closest radio galaxy, NGC 4486 (Virgo A, M87), which he
believed to be the same reference standard for extragalactic radio astronomy as
the Crab Nebula for galactic radio astronomy.
  Shklovsky's approach to the recurrence of the activity phenomenon in galactic
nuclei and the one-sided character of radio ejections from them is discussed.
  Modern views on these issues are also briefly considered.

marginally significant deficit in the number of ULXs, with respect to the
number expected from scaling relations of X-ray binaries with the star
formation rate (SFR). Although the high metalicity of the galaxy could result
in lower ULX numbers, the good agreement between the observed total X-ray
luminosity of ULXs, and that expected from the relevant scaling relation
indicates that this deficit could be the result of confusion effects. The
integrated spectrum of the galaxy shows the presence of a hot gaseous component

use a class-adapted denoiser (patch-based using Gaussian mixture models) in a

situations where the image being processed is from one of a collection of
possible classes or, more importantly, contains regions of different classes.
More specifically, we propose a method to locally select one of a set of
class-adapted Gaussian mixture patch priors, previously estimated from clean

heavier than iron are created in extreme, astrophysical environments. A
particularly challenging part of that question is the creation of the so-called
p-nuclei, which are believed to be mainly produced in some types of supernovae.
The lack of needed nuclear data presents an obstacle in nailing down the
precise site and astrophysical conditions. In this work, we present for the
first time measurements on the nuclear level density and average strength
function of $^{92}$Mo. State-of-the-art p-process calculations systematically
underestimate the observed solar abundance of this isotope. Our data provide
stringent constraints on the $^{91}$Nb$(p,{\gamma})^{92}$Mo reaction rate,
which is the last unmeasured reaction in the nucleosynthesis puzzle of
$^{92}$Mo. Based on our results, we conclude that the $^{92}$Mo abundance
anomaly is not due to the nuclear physics input to astrophysical model
calculations.

  In close binaries with accretion disks the time lag is connected with effects
of viscosity defining a radial motion of matter in the accretion disk. In AGN
flashes, the falling matter has a low angular momentum, and the time lag is
defined by the free fall time to the gravitating center.

dissipation on quantum many-body systems in their many-body localized (MBL)

ergodic state, their dynamics is characterized by slow relaxation manifested in
non-exponential decay of self-correlations. Here we shed light on a currently
much debated issue, namely the role of interactions for this relaxation
dynamics. We focus on the experimentally relevant situation of the evolution
from an initial charge density wave in the presence of strong dephasing noise.
We find a crossover from a regime dominated by disorder to a regime dominated
by interactions, with a concomitant change of time correlators from stretched
exponential to compressed exponential form. The strongly interacting regime can
be explained in terms of nucleation and growth dynamics of relaxing regions -
reminiscent of the kinetics of crystallization in soft matter systems - and
should be observable experimentally. This interaction-driven crossover suggests
that the competition between interactions and noise give rise to a much richer
structure of the MBL phase than anticipated so far.

size and choice of the active orbital space and peculiarities of the

structures of reactants and products can often be well described by
single-reference methods and hence are accessible to accurate coupled cluster

four 3d-metallocenes with the complete active space self-consistent field

data are well within the experimental error bars. This accuracy can also be
approached by complete active space calculations with an orbital selection
based on information entropy measures. The entropy based active space selection

on the functional renormalization group (FRG). The traditional FRG has been
formulated for systems that exhibit a translational symmetry with an associated
Fermi surface, which can provide the organization principle for the
renormalization group (RG) procedure. We here advance an alternative
formulation, where the RG-flow is organized in the energy-domain rather than in
k-space. This has the advantage that it can also be applied to inhomogeneous
matter lacking a band-structure, such as disordered metals or molecules. The
energy-domain FRG ({\epsilon}FRG) presented here accounts for Fermi-liquid
corrections to quasi-particle energies and particle-hole excitations. It goes
beyond the state of the art GW-BSE, because in {\epsilon}FRG the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (BSE) is solved in a self-consistent manner. An efficient
implementation of the approach that has been tested against exact
diagonalization calculations and calculations based on the density matrix
renormalization group is presented.
  Similar to the conventional FRG, also the {\epsilon}FRG is able to signalize
the vicinity of an instability of the Fermi-liquid fixed point via runaway flow
of the corresponding interaction vertex. Embarking upon this fact, in an
application of {\epsilon}FRG to the spinless disordered Hubbard model we
calculate its phase-boundary in the plane spanned by the interaction and
disorder strength. Finally, an extension of the approach to finite temperatures
and spin S = 1/2 is also given.

  Study of the Linux Kernel",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Preprocessors support the diversification of software products with #ifdefs,
but also require additional effort from developers to maintain and understand
variable code. We conjecture that #ifdefs cause developers to produce more
vulnerable code because they are required to reason about multiple features
simultaneously and maintain complex mental models of dependencies of
configurable code.
  We extracted a variational call graph across all configurations of the Linux
kernel, and used configuration complexity metrics to compare vulnerable and
non-vulnerable functions considering their vulnerability history. Our goal was
to learn about whether we can observe a measurable influence of configuration
complexity on the occurrence of vulnerabilities.
  Our results suggest, among others, that vulnerable functions have higher
variability than non-vulnerable ones and are also constrained by fewer
configuration options. This suggests that developers are inclined to notice
functions appear in frequently-compiled product variants. We aim to raise
developers' awareness to address variability more systematically, since
configuration complexity is an important, but often ignored aspect of software
product lines.

Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is investigated. While nonadiabatic
couplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO
approximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is
found to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation.
This is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by
their deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation,
the accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of
the BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context
of a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an
adequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO
approximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately
unentangled. Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement
properties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely
unentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.

range are ubiquitous in solar prominences. The waves are probably driven by
photospheric motions and may transport energy up to prominences suspended in
the corona. Dissipation of wave energy can lead to heating of the cool
prominence plasma, so contributing to the local energy balance within the
prominence. Here we discuss the role of Alfv\'en wave dissipation as a heating
mechanism for the prominence plasma. We consider a slab-like quiescent
prominence model with a transverse magnetic field embedded in the solar corona.
The prominence medium is modelled as a partially ionized plasma composed of a
charged ion-electron single fluid and two separate neutral fluids corresponding
to neutral hydrogen and neutral helium. Friction between the three fluids acts
as a dissipative mechanism for the waves. The heating caused by
externally-driven Alfv\'en waves incident on the prominence slab is
analytically explored. We find that the dense prominence slab acts as a
resonant cavity for the waves. The fraction of incident wave energy that is
channelled into the slab strongly depends upon the wave period, $P$. Using
typical prominence conditions, we obtain that wave energy trapping and
associated heating are negligible when $P \gtrsim 100$ s, so that it is
unlikely that those waves have a relevant influence on prominence energetics.
When $1$ s $\lesssim P \lesssim 100$ s the energy absorption into the slab
shows several sharp and narrow peaks, that can reach up to 100%, when the
incident wave frequency matches a cavity resonance of the slab. Wave heating is
enhanced at those resonant frequencies. Conversely, when $P \lesssim 1$ s
cavity resonances are absent, but the waves are heavily damped by the strong
dissipation. We estimate that wave heating may compensate for about 10% of
radiative losses of the prominence plasma.

properties in rare-earth compounds in general. Here, we investigate and
eventually clarify this discrepancy in the particular case of SmB6 by the
photoemission core-level spectra. We focus on the change in both Sm and B
states depending on time, temperature, probing depth, and surface termination
on the cleaved (100) surface. Our spectra show that the unusual time-dependent
change in the Sm valence occurs within a period of hours, which is not related
to the adsorption of residual gases. Moreover, we observe a reduction of the
surface feature in the B and Sm states on the same timescale accompanied by the
formation of a subsurface region. Thus, it indicates the relatively slow charge
redistribution between the surface and subsurface regions. Our findings
demonstrate that the f states is strongly involved in the surface relaxation.

physiological costs when compared to parthenogenic reproduction, most
prominently: for maintaining the corresponding (molecular) machinery, for
finding a mating partner, and through the decreased fraction of females in a
population, which decreases the reproductive capacity. Based on principles from
information theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic
model, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all
species maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche
and allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea
to the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more
than compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining
populations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to
maintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the
advantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining
populations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison
with asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already
significantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic
complexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity.
The model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses
about the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red
Queen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases
population frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones. In
addition, we suggest simple explanations for niche-dependent prevalence of
transient asexuality and the exceptional asexual lineage of Bdelloid rotifers.

within the tissue. During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle
is aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a
microtubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle
is displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of
centering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle
during the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We
found that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the
transverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured
by the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the
cell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the
fluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of
the short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations
in the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins
underlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of
one thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in
these cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make
contact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high
stability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making
contact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert
compressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of
microtubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning
the spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of
anaphase.

look at the effect this broader set of free parameters has on direct detection

maintaining gauge invariance of the simplified model under the full SM gauge

see very large differences in the mono-jet cross section when the usual
simplified model assumptions are loosened and isospin violation between RH and

totally eclipses its main-sequence companion every 24.6 days. This

Difficulties in obtaining a complete lightcurve mean the precision of existing
radii measurements could be improved. Our aim is to improve the precision of
the radius measurements for the stars in AI Phe using high-precision photometry
from WASP, and use these improved radius measurements together with estimates
of the masses, temperatures and composition of the stars to place constraints
on the mixing length, helium abundance and age of the system. A best-fit ebop
model is used to obtain lightcurve parameters, with their standard errors
calculated using a prayer-bead algorithm. These were combined with previously
published spectroscopic orbit results, to obtain masses and radii. A Bayesian
method is used to estimate the age of the system for model grids with different
mixing lengths and helium abundances. The radii are found to be
$R_1=1.835\pm0.014$ R$_{\odot}$, $R_2=2.912\pm0.014$ R$_{\odot}$ and the masses
$M_1=1.1973\pm0.0037$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_2=1.2473\pm0.0039$ M$_{\odot}$. From the
best-fit stellar models we infer a mixing length of 1.78, a helium abundance of
$Y_{AI}=0.26^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ and an age of $4.39\pm0.32$ Gyr. Times of primary
minimum show the period of AI Phe is not constant. Currently, there are
insufficient data to determine the cause of this variation. Improved precision
in the masses and radii have improved the age estimate, and allowed the mixing
length and helium abundance to be constrained. The eccentricity is now the
largest source of uncertainty in calculating the masses. More binaries with
parameters measured to a similar level of precision would allow us to test for
relationships between helium abundance and mixing length.

based on an expansion of Slater determinants, the FCIQMC method suffers from a

atomization energies in small basis sets, reducing the error from 28~mE$_{\text

enable high-level assumptions about unknown functions to be encoded in a
parsimonious, flexible and general way. Although elegant, the application of
GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when
data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models.
Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the
last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a
small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper, we
develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation
Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point
approximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the
new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference
(variational free-energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing
approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way, all
of approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling
time' resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble
previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes
new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on
regression and classification tasks.

van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF-CX) is employed, which is shown to
yield excellent agreement with reference data for the structural parameters.
The calculated in-plane thermal conductivity compares well with experimental
room temperature values, when phonon-phonon and isotopic scattering are
included. To explain the behavior over the entire available temperature range
one must, however, include additional (temperature independent) scattering
mechanisms that limit the mean free path. Generally, the primary heat carrying
modes have mean free paths of $1\,\mu\text{m}$ or more, which makes these
materials very susceptible to structural defects. The conductivity of Mo and
W-based TMDs is primarily determined by the chalcogenide species and increases
in the order Te-Se-S. While for the tellurides and selenides the transition
metal element has a negligible effect, the conductivity of WS$_2$ is notably
higher than for MoS$_2$, which can be traced to the much larger phonon band gap
of the former. Overall the present study provides a consistent set of thermal

range of potential applications such as spintronic devices, data storage and
sensors. As a strong candidate for the applications among the limited list of
single-phase multiferroic materials, BiFeO3 (BFO) is a quite attractive
material due to its multiferroic properties at room temperature (RT). However,
BFO is widely known to have large leakage current and small spontaneous
polarization due to the existence of crystalline defects such as oxygen
vacancies. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of pure BFO is very weak owing to
its antiferromagnetic nature. In this paper, the effects of Ni2+ substitution
on the magnetic properties of bulk BFO have been investigated. BFO, and
BiFe0.99Ni0.01O3, BiFe0.98Ni0.02O3 and BiFe0.97Ni0.03O3 (BFNO: Ni-doped BFO)
ceramics were prepared by solid-state reaction and rapid sintering, and
analyzed by structural and magnetic-property measurements. The leakage current
density was measured at RT by using a standard ferroelectric tester. All the
Ni-doped BFO exhibit the similar rhombohedral perovskite structure (R3c) to
that of BFO. The magnetic properties of Ni-doped BFO are much enhanced with

  Stochastic Theory of Turbulence","42 pages",,,,"hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A nonlocal quantum-field model is constructed for the system of hydrodynamic
equations for incompressible viscous fluid (the stochastic Navier--Stokes (NS)
equation and the continuity equation). This model is studied by the following
two mutually parallel methods: the Wilson--Polchinski functional
renormalization group method (FRG), which is based on the exact functional
equation for the generating functional of amputated connected Green's functions
(ACGF), and the Heemskerk--Polchinski holographic renormalization group method
(HRG), which is based on the functional Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation for the
holographic boundary action. Both functional equations are equivalent to
infinite hierarchies of integro-differential equations (coupled in the FRG
case) for the corresponding families of Green's functions (GF). The RG-flow
equations can be derived explicitly for two-particle functions. Because the
HRG-flow equation is closed (contains only a two-particle GF), the explicit
analytic solutions are obtained for the two-particle GF (in terms of the
modified Bessel functions $I$ and $K$) in the framework of the minimal
holographic model and its simple generalization, and these solutions have a
remarkable property of minimal dependence on the details of the random force
correlator (the function of the energy pumping into the system). The
restrictions due to the time-gauged Galilean symmetry present in this theory,
the problem of choosing the pumping function, and some generalizations of the
standard RG-flow procedures are discussed in detail. Finally, the question of
whether the HRG-solutions can be used to solve the FRG-flow equation for the
two-particle GF (in particular, the relationship between the regulators in the
two methods) is studied.

low-noise measurements at cryogenic temperatures and investigated their
attenuation characteristics for different wire lengths, shapes, and preparation
methods up to 20 GHz. We used nominally 30-micrometer-sized SUS 304L powder and
mixed with Stycast 2850FT by Emerson and Cumming with catalyst 23LV. A 0.1 mm
insulated copper wire was wound on preformed powder-mixture spools in the shape
of a right-circular cylinder, a flattened elliptic cylinder and a toroid, and
the coils were encapsulated in metal tubes or boxes filled with the powder
mixture. All the fabricated powder filters showed a large attenuation at high
frequencies with a cut-off frequency near 1 GHz. However, the toroidal filter
showed prominent ripples corresponding to resonance modes in the 0.5-m-long
coil wire. A filter with a 2:1 powder/epoxy mixture mass rate and a wire length
of 1.53 m showed an attenuation of -93 dB at 4 GHz and the attenuation was
linearly proportional to the wire length. As the powder-to-epoxy ratio
increased, the high-frequency attenuation increased. An equally-spaced
single-layer coil structure was found to be more efficient in attenuation than
a double-layer coil. Geometry of the metal filter-case affected noise ripples
with the least noise in a circular-tube case.

document summarizes the new method used to treat the elliptical cross section

document does not introduce the new method and the elliptical photonic NW SPS
design in the context of existing literature but instead dives directly into
the equations. Additionally, the document assumes that the reader possess
expert knowledge of general modal expansion techniques. The presented formalism
does not implement Li's factorization rules nor the recently proposed open
boundary geometry formalism with fast convergence towards the open geometry
limit but instead relies on (older) formalism based on coordinate
transformations for emulating open systems. However, the document does contain
all the information needed for the expert reader to implement the method and
reproduce the simulations.

  ill-posed linear inverse problems",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear inverse problems are ubiquitous. Often the measurements do not follow
a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, a model matrix with a large condition
number can complicate the problem further by making it ill-posed. In this case,
the performance of popular estimators may deteriorate significantly. We have
developed a new estimator that is both nearly optimal in the presence of
Gaussian errors while being also robust against outliers. Furthermore, it
obtains meaningful estimates when the problem is ill-posed through the
inclusion of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularizations. The computation of our
estimate involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. Hence, we are not
guaranteed to find the global minimum in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, we
propose two algorithms that converge to a good local minimum in a reasonable
(and adjustable) amount of time, as an approximation of the global minimum. We
also analyze how the introduction of the regularization term affects the
statistical properties of our estimator. We confirm high robustness against
outliers and asymptotic efficiency for Gaussian distributions by deriving
measures of robustness such as the influence function, sensitivity curve, bias,
asymptotic variance, and mean square error. We verify the theoretical results
using numerical experiments and show that the proposed estimator outperforms
recently proposed methods, especially for increasing amounts of outlier
contamination. Python code for all of the algorithms are available online in
the spirit of reproducible research.

transition metal-oxide and carbon nanotube array would help the current
limitations of the modern supercapacitor. TiO2 was chosen for its common
occurrence in everyday materials and promising capacitance levels. A
multi-walled carbon nanotube array was grown on a SiO2 precursor via CCVD. The
transition metal oxide was then deposited via RF Sputtering methods to a MWCNT
array. Recharge tests and characterization were conducted using scanning
capacitance microscopy (SCM). While these tests are preliminary, this novel

efficiency of electrochemical energy storage as well as an advance towards a
