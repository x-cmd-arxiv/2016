$\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$, which is well motivated from three independent
approaches. As is well known, the hint of varying fine structure constant
$\alpha$ was found in 1998. If $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ is right, it means
that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ should also be varying. Here, we try
to develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant
$\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$, in which we view it from an interacting vacuum
energy perspective. Then, we consider the observational constraints on these
models by using the 293 $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ data from the absorption systems
in the spectra of distant quasars. We find that the model parameters can be
tightly constrained to the very narrow ranges of ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ typically.
On the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model
$\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ from another perspective, namely it can be
equivalent to a model containing ""dark energy"" and ""warm dark matter"", but
there is no interaction between them. We find that this is also fully
consistent with the observational constraints on warm dark matter.

been studied for over fifty years, fault tolerance for such solvers has seen
much attention in recent years. For iterative solvers, two major reliable
strategies of recovery exist: checkpoint-restart for backward recovery, or some
type of redundancy technique for forward recovery. Important redundancy
techniques like ABFT techniques for sparse matrix-vector products (SpMxV) have
recently been proposed, which increase the resilience of CG methods. These
techniques offer limited recovery options, and introduce a tolerable overhead.
In this work, we study a more powerful resilience concept, which is redundant
multithreading. It offers more generic and stronger recovery guarantees,
including any soft faults in CG iterations (among others covering ABFT SpMxV),
but also requires more resources. We carefully study this redundancy/efficiency
conflict. We propose a fault tolerant CG method, called TwinCG, which
introduces minimal wallclock time overhead, and significant advantages in
detection and correction strategies. Our method uses Dual Modular Redundancy
instead of the more expensive Triple Modular Redundancy; still, it retains the
TMR advantages of fault correction. We describe, implement, and benchmark our
iterative solver, and compare it in terms of efficiency and fault tolerance
capabilities to state-of-the-art techniques. We find that before
parallelization, TwinCG introduces around 5-6% runtime overhead compared to
standard CG, and after parallelization efficiently uses BLAS. In the presence
of faults, it reliably performs forward recovery for a range of problems,
outperforming SpMxV ABFT solutions.

implemented a radiative transfer module into the JUPITER code to account for
realistic heating and cooling of the gas. We focus on the circumplanetary gas
flow, determining its characteristics at very high resolution ($80\%$ of
Jupiter's diameter). In our nominal simulation where the temperature evolves
freely by the radiative module and reaches 13000 K at the planet, a
circumplanetary envelope was formed filling the entire Roche-lobe. Because of
our equation of state is simplified and probably overestimates the temperature,
we also performed simulations with limited maximal temperatures in the planet
region (1000 K, 1500 K, and 2000 K). In these fixed temperature cases
circumplanetary disks (CPDs) were formed. This suggests that the capability to
form a circumplanetary disk is not simply linked to the mass of the planet and
its ability to open a gap. Instead, the gas temperature at the planet's
location, which depends on its accretion history, plays also fundamental role.
The CPDs in the simulations are hot and cooling very slowly, they have very
steep temperature and density profiles, and are strongly sub-Keplerian.
Moreover, the CPDs are fed by a strong vertical influx, which shocks on the CPD
surfaces creating a hot and luminous shock-front. In contrast, the pressure
supported circumplanetary envelope is characterized by internal convection and
almost stalled rotation.

process) models is introduced. The main idea is to solve not one, but an entire
family of MDPs, parameterized by a weighting factor $\zeta$ that appears in the
one-step reward function. For an MDP with $d$ states, the family of value
functions $\{ h^*_\zeta : \zeta\in\Re\}$ is the solution to an ODE, $$
\frac{d}{d\zeta} h^*_\zeta = {\cal V}(h^*_\zeta) $$ where the vector field
${\cal V}\colon\Re^d\to\Re^d$ has a simple form, based on a matrix inverse.
  This general methodology is applied to a family of average-cost optimal
control models in which the one-step reward function is defined by
Kullback-Leibler divergence. The motivation for this reward function in prior
work is computation: The solution to the MDP can be expressed in terms of the
Perron-Frobenius eigenvector for an associated positive matrix. The drawback
with this approach is that no hard constraints on the control are permitted. It
is shown here that it is possible to extend this framework to model randomness
from nature that cannot be modified by the controller. Perron-Frobenius theory
is no longer applicable -- the resulting dynamic programming equations appear
as complex as a completely unstructured MDP model. Despite this apparent
complexity, it is shown that this class of MDPs admits a solution via this new
ODE technique. This approach is new and practical even for the simpler problem
in which randomness from nature is absent.

account for subgrid scale effects in explicitly filtered large eddy simulations

diffusion model and demonstrate its shock capturing ability and spectral
performance for solving the Burgers turbulence problem, which is a simplified
prototype for more realistic turbulent flows showing the same quadratic
nonlinearity. Our numerical assessments present the behavior of various
diffusivity functions in conjunction with a detailed sensitivity analysis with
respect to the free modeling parameters. In comparison to direct numerical
simulation (DNS) and under-resolved DNS results, we find that the proposed
closure model is efficient in the prevention of energy accumulation at grid
cut-off and is also adept at preventing any possible spurious numerical
oscillations due to shock formation under the optimal parameter choices. In
contrast to other relaxation filtering approaches, it is also shown that a
larger inertial range can be obtained by the proposed anisotropic diffusion
model using a compact stencil scheme in an efficient way.

compression, which is the task where Alice receives a sample from a known

small error. This problem has a one-shot solution due to Huffman, in which the
messages are of variable length and the expected length of the messages matches
the asymptotic and i.i.d. compression rate of the Shannon entropy of the
source.
  In this work, we consider a quantum extension of above task, where Alice
receives a sample from a known probability distribution and needs to transmit a
part of a pure quantum state (that is associated to the sample) to Bob. We
allow entanglement assistance in the protocol, so that the communication is
possible through classical messages, for example using quantum teleportation.
The classical messages can have a variable length and the goal is to minimize
their expected length. We provide a characterization of the expected
communication cost of this task, by giving a lower bound that is near optimal
up to some additive factors.
  A special case of above task, and the quantum analogue of the source
compression problem, is when Alice needs to transmit the whole of her pure
quantum state. Here we show that there is no one-shot interactive scheme which
matches the asymptotic and i.i.d. compression rate of the von Neumann entropy
of the average quantum state. This is a relatively rare case in quantum
information theory where the cost of a quantum task is significantly different
from its classical analogue. Further, we also exhibit similar results for the
fully quantum task of quantum state redistribution, employing some different
techniques. We show implications for the one-shot version of the problem of
quantum channel simulation.

spectrum and infrastructure sharing. However, even when sharing is technically
beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be
profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of
resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave
service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, where
consumers' utility depends on the size of the network, and the strategic
decisions of consumers and service providers are connected to detailed network
simulations. The results suggest that ""open"" deployments of neutral small cells

it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than ""open"" (unlicensed)

line are studied. The orthogonality is understood in a broad sense, and is
given in terms of a nondegenerate continuous sesquilinear form, which in turn
is determined by a quasidefinite matrix of bivariate generalized functions with
a well defined support. The discussion of the orthogonality for such a
sesquilinear form includes, among others, matrix Hankel cases with linear
functionals, general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal
polynomials with an infinite support. The first transformation considered is
that of Geronimus type, two different methods are developed. A spectral one,
based on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial, and constructed
in terms of the second kind functions. Then, using spectral techniques and
spectral jets, Christoffel-Geronimus formulas for the transformed polynomials
and norms are presented. For this type of transformations, the paper also
proposes an alternative method, which does not require of spectral techniques.
A discussion on matrix spectral linear transformations is presented, as well.
These transformations can be understood as rational perturbations of the matrix
of bivariate generalized functions together with an addition of appropriate
masses, determined these last ones by the spectral properties of the polynomial
denominator. As for the Geronimus case, two techniques are applied, spectral
and mixed spectral/nonspectral. Christoffel--Geronimus--Uvarov formulas are
found with both approaches and some applications are given. The transformation
theory is finally discussed in the context of the 2D non-Abelian Toda lattice
and noncommutative KP hierarchies, understood as the theory of continuous
transformations of quasidefinite sesquilinear forms. This approach allows for
the finding of perturbed quasitau and Baker matrices.

forms through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. These mechanisms
have important consequences on the morphology and nucleation rates of the
resultant crystals but it is unclear whether a nucleus forms spontaneously from
solution in a single step or through multiple steps. Using in-situ electron
microscopy, we observe and quantify how gold and silver nanocrystals nucleate
from a supersaturated aqueous gold and silver solution in three distinct steps:
(I) spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases, (II)
nucleation of amorphous gold nanoclusters within the gold-rich liquid phase,
followed by (III) crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab-initio
calculations on gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated
with strong gold-gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold

important implications for the formation and growth of both crystalline and

(or ""signature"") that characterizes the heartbeat pattern for an individual in
ballistocardiogram data. The $e$FUMI method models the problem of learning a
heartbeat concept from a BCG signal as a MIL problem. This approach elegantly
addresses the uncertainty inherent in a BCG signal e. g., misalignment between
training data and ground truth, mis-collection of heartbeat by some
transducers, etc. Given a BCG training signal coupled with a ground truth
signal (e.g., a pulse finger sensor), training ""bags"" labeled with only binary
labels denoting if a training bag contains a heartbeat signal or not can be
generated. Then, using these bags, $e$FUMI learns a personalized concept of
heartbeat for a subject as well as several non-heartbeat background concepts.
After learning the heartbeat concept, heartbeat detection and heart rate
estimation can be applied to test data. Experimental results show that the
estimated heartbeat concept found by $e$FUMI is more representative and a more
discriminative prototype of the heartbeat signals than those found by
comparison MIL methods in the literature.

the influence is propagated from seed users only once following a probabilistic
diffusion model and users' activation are determined via single cascade. In

receiving enough pieces of information propagated to her before she makes the
final purchase decision. In this paper we model such cumulative activation as
the following process: first multiple pieces of information are propagated
independently in the social network following the classical independent cascade
model, then the user will be activated (and adopt the product) if the
cumulative pieces of information she received reaches her cumulative activation
threshold. Two optimization problems are investigated under this framework:
seed minimization with cumulative activation (SM-CA), which asks how to select
a seed set with minimum size such that the number of cumulatively active nodes
reaches a given requirement $\eta$; influence maximization with cumulative
activation (IM-CA), which asks how to choose a seed set with fixed budget to
maximize the number of cumulatively active nodes. For SM-CA problem, we design
a greedy algorithm that yields a bicriteria $O(\ln n)$-approximation when
$\eta=n$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. For both SM-CA
problem with $\eta<n$ and IM-CA problem, we prove strong inapproximability

follows: particular spatial points follow an exceptional dynamical path that
differs from that of their neighbors, with the consequence that, in the
neighborhood of these exceptional points, the spatial profile becomes ever more
sharp. Spikes are consequences of the BKL-type oscillatory evolution towards
generic singularities of spacetime. Do spikes persist when the spacetime
dynamics is treated using quantum mechanics? To address this question, we treat
a Hamiltonian system that describes the dynamics of the approach to the
singularity and consider how to quantize that system. We argue that this

on an undirected weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ into a distribution of tree metrics
$(T,D_T)$ such that for every pair $u,v\in V$, $d_G(u,v)\leq d_T(u,v)$ and
${\bf{E}}_{T}[d_T(u,v)]\leq O(\log n)\cdot d_G(u,v)$. Such embeddings have
proved highly useful in designing fast approximation algorithms, as many hard
problems on graphs are easy to solve on tree instances. For a graph with $n$
vertices and $m$ edges, our algorithm runs in $O(m\log n)$ time with high
probability, which improves the previous upper bound of $O(m\log^3 n)$ shown by
Mendel et al.\,in 2009.
  The key component of our algorithm is a new approximate single-source
shortest-path algorithm, which implements the priority queue with a new data
structure, the ""bucket-tree structure"". The algorithm has three properties: it
only requires linear time in the number of edges in the input graph; the
computed distances have a distance preserving property; and when computing the
shortest-paths to the $k$-nearest vertices from the source, it only requires to
visit these vertices and their edge lists. These properties are essential to
guarantee the correctness and the stated time bound.
  Using this shortest-path algorithm, we show how to generate an intermediate
structure, the approximate dominance sequences of the input graph, in $O(m \log
n)$ time, and further propose a simple yet efficient algorithm to converted
this sequence to a tree embedding in $O(n\log n)$ time, both with high
probability. Combining the three subroutines gives the stated time bound of the
algorithm.
  Then we show that this efficient construction can facilitate some
applications. We proved that FRT trees (the generated tree embedding) are
Ramsey partitions with asymptotically tight bound, so the construction of a
series of distance oracles can be accelerated.

real-time fashion to make real-time decisions. Such tasks include simple
reporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicality
of such analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with a
fundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy.
  In this paper, we study this trade-off in the context of a specific domain,
Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). Our choice of this domain is influenced
by its commonalities with several other domains that produce real-time data,
our access to a large live dataset, and their real-time nature and
dimensionality which makes it a natural fit for a popular analysis technique,
machine learning (ML). We find that the latency accuracy trade-off can be
resolved using two broad, general techniques: intelligent data grouping and
task formulations that leverage domain characteristics. Based on this, we
present CellScope, a system that addresses this challenge by applying a domain
specific formulation and application of Multi-task Learning (MTL) to RAN
performance analysis. It achieves this goal using three techniques: feature
engineering to transform raw data into effective features, a PCA inspired
similarity metric to group data from geographically nearby base stations
sharing performance commonalities, and a hybrid online-offline model for
efficient model updates. Our evaluation of CellScope shows that its accuracy
improvements over direct application of ML range from 2.5x to 4.4x while
reducing the model update overhead by up to 4.8x. We have also used CellScope
to analyze a live LTE consisting of over 2 million subscribers for a period of
over 10 months, where it uncovered several problems and insights, some of them
previously unknown.

unknown signal $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{R}^n$ is of prime importance and the
focus of reconstruction algorithms has mainly been either $\|x\|_0$ or its
convex relaxation (via $\|x\|_1$). However, it is typically unknown in practice
and has remained a challenge when nothing about the size of the support is
known. As pointed recently, $\|x\|_0$ might not be the best metric to minimize
directly, both due to its inherent complexity as well as its noise performance.
Recently a novel stable measure of sparsity $s(\mathbf{x}) :=
\|\mathbf{x}\|_1^2/\|\mathbf{x}\|_2^2$ has been investigated by Lopes
\cite{Lopes2012}, which is a sharp lower bound on $\|\mathbf{x}\|_0$. The
estimation procedure for this measure uses only a small number of linear
measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very
little computation. The usage of the quantity $s(\mathbf{x})$ in sparse signal
estimation problems has not received much importance yet. We develop the idea
of incorporating $s(\mathbf{x})$ into the signal estimation framework. We also

curvature to the realm of undirected networks. Investigation of Forman
curvature in diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that
this measure captures several aspects of the organization of complex undirected
networks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed
in nature, and the Forman curvature for undirected networks is unsuitable for
analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we here extend the Forman curvature
for undirected networks to the case of directed networks. The simple
mathematical formula for the Forman curvature in directed networks elegantly
incorporates node weights, edge weights and edge direction. By applying the
Forman curvature for directed networks to a variety of model and real-world

real directed networks which are weighted or spatial in nature. These results

single-parameter Gaussian approximation methods produce very poor results in

on event horizon in $f(R)$ gravity. While thermodynamical laws holds in

With alternative formulation of thermodynamical parameters (temperature and
entropy), thermodynamical laws hold on event horizon in Einstein Gravity. With
this motivation, we extend the idea of generalised Hawking temperature and
modified Bekenstein entropy in homogeneous and isotropic model of universe on
event horizon and examine whether thermodynamical laws hold in f(R) gravity.
Specifically, we examine and compare validity of generalised second law of
thermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamical equilibrium (TE) in four alternative
modified Bekenstein scenarios. As Dark energy is a possible dominant candidate
for matter in the univerese and Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) can give
effective description of f(R) gravity, so matter in the universe is taken as in
the form interacting HDE. In order to understand the complicated expressions,
finally the above laws are examined from graphical representation using three
Planck data sets and it is found that generalised/modified Hawking temperature
has a crucial role in making perfect thermodynamical system.

frequency (RF) chains and relieve the huge energy consumption in mmWave massive
MIMO systems, thus attracting much interests from academic and industry.
However, most existing hybrid precoding schemes are based on singular value
decomposition (SVD). Due to the very different sub-channel signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) after SVD, complicated bit allocations is usually required to
match the sub-channel SNRs. To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean
decomposition (GMD)-based hybrid precoding scheme to avoid the complicated bit
allocation. Its basic idea is to seek a pair of analog and digital precoding
matrices that are sufficiently close to the optimal unconstrained GMD precoding
matrix. Specifically, we design the analog (digital) precoding matrix while
keeping the digital (analog) precoding matrix fixed. Further, the principle of
basis pursuit is utilized in the design of analog precoding matrix, while we
obtain the digital precoding matrix by projecting the GMD operation on the
digital precoding matrix. Simulation results verify that the proposed GMD-based
hybird precoding scheme outperforms conventional SVD-based hybrid precoding
schemes and achieves much better bit error rate (BER) performance with low
complexity.

communication is a prerequisite. Public key infrastructure (PKI) can be used to
secure VANETs where an onboard tamper proof device (TPD) stores a number of
encryption keys which are renewed upon visiting a certificate authority (CA).
We previously proposed a dynamic key distribution protocol for PKI-based VANETs
[1] to reduce the role of the TPD. A vehicle dynamically requests a key from
its nearest road side unit. This request is propagated through network
infrastructure to reach a CA cloud and a key is securely returned. A proposed
key revocation mechanism reduced the number of messages needed for revocation
through Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution. In this paper,
performance evaluation and security of the proposed dynamic key distribution is
investigated analytically and through network simulation. Furthermore,
extensive analysis is performed to demonstrate how the proposed protocol can
dynamically support efficient and cost-reduced key distribution. Analysis and
performance evaluation results clearly make the case for dynamic key
distribution for PKI-based VANETS.

surface and presents linear polarization of its continuum. We have previously
discovered linear polarization signatures associated with individual lines in
the spectra of cool and evolved stars. Here, we investigate whether a similar
linearly polarized spectrum exists for Betelgeuse. We used the
spectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain
high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the
least-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach. We have discovered the existence of
a linearly polarized spectrum for Betelgeuse, detecting a rather strong signal
(at a few times 10$^{-4}$ of the continuum intensity level), both in individual
lines and in the LSD profiles. Studying its properties and the signal observed
for the resonant \ion{Na}{i}\,D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing
depolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear
polarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the
radiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh
scattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to
interpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two
brightness spots and their positions on the surface of Betelgeuse. We show that
applying the model to each velocity bin along the Stokes Q and U profiles
allows the derivation of a map of the bright spots. We use the Narval linear
polarization observations of Betelgeuse obtained over a period of 1.4 years to
study the evolution of the spots. Our study of the linearly polarized spectrum
of Betelgeuse provides a novel method for studying the evolution of brightness
spots at its surface and complements quasi-simultaneous observations obtained
with PIONIER at the VLTI.

sheet morphology that in projection appears filamentary. The stellar winds are
introduced using appropriate Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 solar
mass star case, the wind forms a narrow bipolar cavity with minimal effect on
the parent cloud. In the 40 solar mass star case, the more powerful stellar
wind creates a large cylindrical cavity through the centre of the cloud. After
12.5 Myrs and 4.97 Myrs respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae
(SNe). In the 15 solar mass star case, the SN material and energy is primarily
deposited into the molecular cloud surroundings over ~10^5 years before the SN
remnant escapes the cloud. In the 40 solar mass star case, a significant
fraction of the SN material and energy rapidly escapes the molecular cloud

further star formation), and strengthen the magnetic field, typically by

dynamically screened, because of which the expansion rate is {\em smaller} than
that in $\Lambda$CDM at high redshifts. In this paper, we constrain the Phantom
braneworld using distance measures such as Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the compressed Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) data. We find that the simplest braneworld models provide a good fit to
the data. For instance, BAO +SNeIa data can be accommodated by the braneworld
for a large region in parameter space $0 < \Omega_l < 0.3$ at $1\sigma$. The
Hubble parameter can be as high as $H_0 < 78$ km/s/Mpc, and the effective
equation of state at present can show phantom-like behaviour with $w_0 < -1.2$
at $1\sigma$. We note a correlation between $H_0$ and $w_0$, with higher values
of $H_0$ leading to a lower, and more phantom-like, value of $w_0$. Inclusion
of CMB data provides tighter constraints $\Omega_l < 0.1$. (Here $\Omega_l$
encodes the ratio of the five and four dimensional Planck mass.) The Hubble
parameter in this case is more tightly constrained to $H_0 < 71$ km/s/Mpc, and
the effective equation of state to $w_0 < -1.1$. Interestingly, we find that
the universe is allowed be closed or open, with $-0.5 < \Omega_{\kappa} < 0.5$,
even on including the compressed CMB data. There appears to be some tension in
the low and high $z$ BAO data which may either be resolved by future data, or
act as a pointer to interesting new cosmology.

by certain breather solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger (fNLS)
equation which are referred to as solitons on finite background (SFBs). A more
general modelling of rogue waves can be achieved via the consideration of
multiphase, or finite-band, fNLS solutions of whom the standard SFBs and the
structures forming due to their collisions represent particular, degenerate,
cases. A generalised rogue wave notion then naturally enters as a
large-amplitude localised coherent structure occurring within a finite-band
fNLS solution. In this paper, we use the winding of real tori to show the
mechanism of the appearance of such generalized rogue waves and derive an
analytical criterion distinguishing finite-band potentials of the fNLS equation
that exhibit generalised rogue waves.

engaging in politics, and conducting business. Ironically, the same enabling
social media technology is encroaching into everyday life and reconfiguring
relations of participation. Yet, while participation in online communities has
been widely studied empirically, theoretical aspects of this social phenomenon
need further investigation. This paper uses a sociomaterial perspective to
further develop theoretical explanation of participation in online communities
and the impacts of not participating online. A sociomaterial view of online
community participation decenters the human participant and recognises the
agency of technology, thus creating a richer understanding than epistemological
paradigms. Using converging hermeneutic circles, the paper first reviews
literature for evidence of sociomaterial applications to online community
research, and then proposes a framework for expressing participation in online
communities from a sociomaterial perspective. Subsequently, implications of the
findings and the potential for future studies are discussed.

resulting in an approximation of the full probability distribution for the

probability distribution is computationally expensive, parallelised algorithms
can make many practically relevant problems computationally feasible. The
probability distribution not only provides estimates for the values of the

mathematical model is used to study the outcome of real-world experiments.
Keeping in mind the applicability of our approach to tackle real-world

content. These allow for efficient organization and categorization of items, as
well as facilitate relevant search queries. As such, the selected set of tags
for an item can have a considerable effect on the volume of traffic that
eventually reaches an item. In settings where tags are chosen by an item's
creator, who in turn is interested in maximizing traffic, a principled approach
for choosing tags can prove valuable. In this paper we introduce the problem of
optimal tagging, where the task is to choose a subset of tags for a new item
such that the probability of a browsing user reaching that item is maximized.
We formulate the problem by modeling traffic using a Markov chain, and asking
how transitions in this chain should be modified to maximize traffic into a
certain state of interest. The resulting optimization problem involves
maximizing a certain function over subsets, under a cardinality constraint. We
show that the optimization problem is NP-hard, but nonetheless has a simple
(1-1/e)-approximation via a simple greedy algorithm. Furthermore, the structure
of the problem allows for an efficient implementation of the greedy step.To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform experiments on three
tagging datasets, and show that the greedy algorithm outperforms other
baselines.

imaging from the GAMA survey we use bulge-disc decompositions to understand the
wavelength-dependent behavior of single-S\'ersic structural measurements.
  We denote the variation in single-S\'ersic index with wavelength as
$\mathcal{N}$, likewise for effective radius we use $\mathcal{R}$. We find that
most galaxies with a substantial disc, even those with no discernable bulge,
display a high value of $\mathcal{N}$. The increase in S\'ersic index to longer
wavelengths is therefore intrinsic to discs, apparently resulting from radial
variations in stellar population and/or dust reddening. Similarly, low values
of $\mathcal{R}$ ($<$ 1) are found to be ubiquitous, implying an element of
universality in galaxy colour gradients.
  We also study how bulge and disc colour distributions vary with galaxy type.
We find that, rather than all bulges being red and all discs being blue in
absolute terms, both components become redder for galaxies with redder total
colours. We even observe that bulges in bluer galaxies are typically bluer than
discs in red galaxies, and that bulges and discs are closer in colour for
fainter galaxies. Trends in total colour are therefore not solely due to the
colour or flux dominance of the bulge or disc.

chemical and dynamical point of view. It presents a rich molecular chemistry
characterized by large abundances of deuterated and complex molecules.
Furthermore, it hosts an extremely young Class 0 object and one candidate to
First Hydrostatic Core (FHSC). Our aim was to determine the cosmic ray
ionization rate and the depletion factors in this extremely young star forming
region. We carried out a spectral survey towards Barnard 1b as part of the IRAM
Large program ASAI using the IRAM 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta (Spain). This
provided a very complete inventory of neutral and ionic C-, N- and S- bearing
species with, up to our knowledge, the first secure detections of the
deuterated ions DCS+ and DOCO+. We used a state-of-the-art
pseudo-time-dependent gas-phase chemical model to determine the value of the
cosmic ray ionization rate and the depletion factors. The observational data
were well fitted with $\zeta_{H_2}$ between 3E-17 s$^{-1}$ and 1E-16 s$^{-1}$.
Elemental depletions were estimated to be ~10 for C and O, ~1 for N and ~25 for
S. Barnard B1b presents similar depletions of C and O than those measured in
pre-stellar cores. The depletion of sulfur is higher than that of C and O but
not as extreme as in cold cores. In fact, it is similar to the values found in
some bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several
scenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose
that it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and
enhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that
permits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical
depths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the
surrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as
well.

$\gamma=3$ when the transition is of infinite order at $K_c=0$ independently on
the random fields. Contrarily to the Ising model, even strong Gaussian random
fields do not suppress the second-order phase transition in both complete
graphs and scale-free networks though the fields increase the critical coupling
for $\gamma > 3$. Our simulations support these analytical results.

literature to predict the activity of neuronal populations, given only the
time-averaged correlations of the neuron activities. This paper provides
evidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, predicts
a bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some
population sizes the second mode peaks at high activities, with 90% of the
neuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. This
bimodality has several undesirable consequences: 1. The presence of two modes
is unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity. 2. The prediction of a
high-activity mode is unrealistic on neurobiological grounds. 3. Boltzmann
learning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise model found by this method is
not the maximum entropy distribution; similarly, solving the inverse problem by
common variants of mean-field approximations has the same problem. 4. The
Glauber dynamics associated with the model is either unrealistically bistable,
or does not reflect the distribution of the pairwise model. This bimodality is
first demonstrated for an experimental dataset comprising 159 neuron activities
recorded from the motor cortex of macaque monkey. Using a reduced
maximum-entropy model, evidence is then provided that this bimodality affects
typical neural recordings of population sizes of a couple of hundreds or more
neurons. As a way to eliminate the bimodality and its ensuing problems, a
modified pairwise model is presented, which -- most important -- has an
associated pairwise Glauber dynamics. This model avoids bimodality thanks to a
minimal asymmetric inhibition. It can be interpreted as a
minimum-relative-entropy model with a particular prior, or as a maximum-entropy
model with an additional constraint.

second-quantized fermionic fields coupled to classical bosonic fields. The
focus is on getting a mathematically sound connection between causal fermion

as in the development and verification of the HSA-compliant platform itself. We
use the Event-B language to build a provably correct hierarchy of models from
the most abstract to a detailed refinement of HSA close to implementation
level. Our memory models are general in that they represent an arbitrary number
of masters, programs and instruction interleavings. We reason about such
general models using refinements. Using Rodin tool we are able to model and
verify an entire hierarchy of models using proofs to establish that each
refinement is correct. We define an automated validation method that allows us
to test baseline compliance of the model against a suite of published HSA
litmus tests. Once we complete model validation we develop a coverage driven
method to extract a richer set of tests from the Event-B model and a user
specified coverage model. These tests are used for extensive regression testing
of hardware and software systems. Our method of refinement based formal

quantified by the $l_{1}$-norm QC, when a qubit (a two-level quantum system) is
subjected to noise quantum channels commonly appearing in quantum information
science. We notice that QC is generally not conserved and that even incoherent
initial states can lead to transitory system-environment QC. We show that for
the amplitude damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of
local and non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On
the other hand, for the phase damping channel (PDC) entanglement does not
account for all non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and
also on the qubit's initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and
conditions for time invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase,
and bit-phase flip channels. Here we reveal the qualitative dynamical
inequivalence between these channels and the PDC and show that the creation of
system-environment entanglement does not necessarily imply in the destruction
of the qubit's QC. We also investigate the resources needed for non-local QC
creation, showing that while the PDC requires initial coherence of the qubit,
for some other channels non-zero population of the excited state (i.e., energy)
is sufficient. Related to that, considering the depolarizing channel we notice
the qubit's ability to act as a catalyst for the creation of joint QC and
entanglement, without need for nonzero initial QC or excited state population.

high-density properties of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed
in light kaonic nuclei with the relativistic mean-field theory. More
specifically, the $1p_{1/2}$ halo spreads out linearly with increasing the
pressure and sound velocity square at supra-normal densities and quadratically
with decreasing the incompressibility at saturation density. These results
suggest that the novel halo in light kaonic nuclei can serve as a sensitive
indicator of the nuclear EOS of symmetric matter at supra-normal densities.

invariance, that would be seen as a statistical anisotropy in the angular
correlations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) temperature
fluctuations. This can be described by a general parameterisation of the
initial conditions that takes into account the possible direction-dependence of
both the amplitude and the phase of particle creation during inflation. The
leading effect in the CMBR two-point function is typically a quadrupole
modulation, whose coefficient is analytically constrained here to be $|B|
\lesssim 0.06$. The CMBR three-point function then acquires enhanced
non-gaussianity, especially for the local configurations. In the large
occupation number limit, a distinctive prediction is a modulation of the
non-gaussianity around a mean value depending on the angle that short and long
wavelength modes make with the preferred direction. The maximal variations with
respect to the mean value occur for the configurations which are coplanar with
the preferred direction and the amplitude of the non-gaussianity increases
(decreases) for the short wavelength modes aligned with (perpendicular to) the
preferred direction. For a high scale model of inflation with maximally pumped
up isotropic occupation and $\epsilon\simeq 0.01$ the difference between these
two configurations is about $0.27$, which could be detectable in the future.
For purely anisotropic particle creation, the non-Gaussianity can be larger and
its anisotropic feature very sharp. The non-gaussianity can then reach $f_{NL}
\sim 30$ in the preferred direction while disappearing from the correlations in
the orthogonal plane.

parity-time symmetric media with well-designed loss and gain are presented to
create a nontrivial effect of unidirectional diffraction, which is observed
near the exceptional points (EPs) in the non-Hermitian systems. Here, we report
the design and realization of non-Hermitian acoustic metamaterial (NHAM) and
show that by judiciously tailoring the inherent loss, the phase and amplitude
of reflection can possibly be tuned in a decoupled manner. Such decoupled

It is simply defined as follows: start with an initial percolation
configuration $\omega(t=0)$. Let this configuration evolve in time according to
a simple exclusion process with symmetric kernel $K(x,y)$. We start with a
general investigation (following [HPS97]) of this dynamical process $t \mapsto
\omega_K(t)$ which we call $K$-exclusion dynamical percolation. We then proceed
with a detailed analysis of the planar case at the critical point (both for the
triangular grid and the square lattice $Z^2$) where we consider the power-law
kernels $K^\alpha$ \[ K^{\alpha}(x,y) \propto \frac 1 {\|x-y\|_2^{2+\alpha}} \,
. \] We prove that if $\alpha > 0$ is chosen small enough, there exist
exceptional times $t$ for which an infinite cluster appears in
$\omega_{K^{\alpha}}(t)$. (On the triangular grid, we prove that it holds for
all $\alpha < \alpha_0 = \frac {217}{816}$.) The existence of such exceptional
times for standard i.i.d. dynamical percolation (where sites evolve according
to independent Poisson point processes) goes back to the work by Schramm-Steif
in [SS10]. In order to handle such a $K$-exclusion dynamics, we push further
the spectral analysis of exclusion noise sensitivity which had been initiated
in [BGS13]. (The latter paper can be viewed as a conservative analogue of the
seminal paper by Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm [BKS99] on i.i.d. noise sensitivity.)
The case of a nearest-neighbour simple exclusion process, corresponding to the
limiting case $\alpha = +\infty$, is left widely open.

The aim is to provide a unified and flexible approach to the semiclassical
analysis of bosonic systems. We also give a detailed overview of possible
applications of this approach to mathematical problems of both axiomatic
relativistic quantum field theories and nonrelativistic many body systems. If
the theory has infinitely many degrees of freedom, the set of Wigner measures,
i.e. the classical counterpart of the set of quantum states, coincides with the
set of all cylindrical measures acting on the algebraic dual of the space of
test functions for the field, and this reveals a very rich semiclassical
structure compared to the finite-dimensional case. We characterize the
cylindrical Wigner measures and the \emph{a priori} properties they inherit
from the corresponding quantum states.

us to easily monitor a network and identify coordinated reports manifesting
significant network disruptions, reducing uninteresting alarms. Our

displacements up to 3rd-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), in contrast
with previous versions that used Zeldovich approximation (ZA).
  We run Pinocchio on the same initial configuration of a reference N-body
simulation, so that the comparison extends to the object-by-object level. We
consider haloes at redshifts 0 and 1, using different LPT orders either for
halo construction - where displacements are needed to decide particle accretion
onto a halo or halo merging - or to compute halo final positions.
  We compare the clustering properties of Pinocchio haloes with those from the
simulation by computing the power spectrum and 2-point correlation function
(2PCF) in real and redshift space (monopole and quadrupole), the bispectrum and
the phase difference of halo distributions. We find that 2LPT and 3LPT give
noticeable improvement. 3LPT provides the best agreement with N-body when it is
used to displace haloes, while 2LPT gives better results for constructing
haloes. At the highest orders, linear bias is typically recovered at a few per
cent level.
  In Fourier space and using 3LPT for halo displacements, the halo power
spectrum is recovered to within 10 per cent up to $k_{max}\sim0.5\ h/$Mpc. The
results presented in this paper have interesting implications for the

HI velocity components. Magnetic and kinematical data suggest a close
connection between these components. They may represent gas on either side of a
shock wave preceding a weak-D ionization front. Magnetic fields in the Veil HI

Strong fields in the Veil HI components may have resulted from low turbulence

devices reflect existing RF signals emitted by legacy communications systems,

photonic resonators which, as compared to a silicon (Si) thin film, do not only
absorb more visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light, but also show an
inherent photonic light concentration that enhances their performance as solar
absorbers. Using numerical simulations we show, how light concentration is
induced by high optical cross sections of the individual SiNWs but cannot be
optimized independently of the SiNW array absorption. While an ideal spatial
density exists, for which the SiNW array absorption for VIS and NIR wavelengths
reaches a maximum, the spatial correlation of SiNWs in an array suppresses the
formation of optical Mie modes responsible for light concentration. We show
that different from SiNWs with straight sidewalls, arrays of inverted silicon
nanocones (SiNCs) permit to avoid the mode suppression. In fact they give rise
to an altered set of photonic modes which is induced by the spatial correlation
of SiNCs in the array, and therefore show a higher degree of freedom to
independently optimize light absorption and light concentration. Apart from
explaining the good light absorbing and concentrating properties of SiNC
arrays, the work justifies a revaluation of SiNW arrays as optical absorbers.

is poorly understood, but studies of Cepheids and a small sample of open
clusters suggest that it steepens in the inner disk. We investigate the
metallicity gradient of the inner disk using a sample of inner disk open
clusters that is three times larger than has previously been studied in the
literature to better characterize the gradient in this part of the disk. We
used the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) [Fe/H] values and stellar parameters for stars
in 12 open clusters in the inner disk from GES-UVES data. Cluster mean [Fe/H]
values were determined based on a membership analysis for each cluster. Where
necessary, distances and ages to clusters were determined via comparison to
theoretical isochrones. The GES open clusters exhibit a radial metallicity
gradient of -0.10+-0.02 dex/kpc, consistent with the gradient measured by other
literature studies of field red giant stars and open clusters in the range R_GC
~ 6-12 kpc. We also measure a trend of increasing [Fe/H] with increasing
cluster age, as has also been found in the literature. We find no evidence for
a steepening of the inner disk metallicity gradient inside the solar circle as
earlier studies indicated. The age-metallicity relation shown by the clusters
is consistent with that predicted by chemical evolution models that include the
effects of radial migration, but a more detailed comparison between cluster
observations and models would be premature.

method for the photometric classification of SLSNe to construct our sample. Our
sample includes two previously spectroscopically-identified objects, and a
further new candidate selected using our classification technique. We use the
point-source recovery efficiencies from Perrett et.al. (2010) and a Monte Carlo
approach to calculate the rate based on our SLSN sample. We find that the three
identified SLSNe from SNLS give a rate of 91 (+76/-36) SNe/Yr/Gpc^3 at a
volume-weighted redshift of z=1.13. This is equivalent to 2.2 (+1.8/-0.9)
x10^-4 of the volumetric core collapse supernova rate at the same redshift.
When combined with other rate measurements from the literature, we show that
the rate of SLSNe increases with redshift in a manner consistent with that of
the cosmic star formation history. We also estimate the rate of ultra-long
gamma ray bursts (ULGRBs) based on the events discovered by the Swift
satellite, and show that it is comparable to the rate of SLSNe, providing
further evidence of a possible connection between these two classes of events.
We also examine the host galaxies of the SLSNe discovered in SNLS, and find
them to be consistent with the stellar-mass distribution of other published
samples of SLSNe.
