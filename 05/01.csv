John domains with uniform constants. We prove that for every simply connected
domain $\Omega \subset {\Bbb R}^2$ with $C^1$-boundary there is a corresponding
partition $\Omega = \Omega_1 \cup \ldots \cup \Omega_N$ with $\sum_{j=1}^N
\mathcal{H}^1(\partial \Omega_j \setminus \partial \Omega) \le \theta$ such
that each component is a John domain with a John constant only depending on
$\theta$. The result implies that many inequalities in Sobolev spaces such as
Poincar\'e's or Korn's inequality hold on the partition of $\Omega$ for uniform
constants, which are independent of $\Omega$.

quality or high frame rates but are not able to deliver high spatial and
temporal resolution simultaneously, which limits their ability to image dynamic
processes in living tissue. A particular example is the planar Fabry-Perot (FP)
scanner, which yields high-resolution images but takes several minutes to
sequentially map the photoacoustic field on the sensor plane, point-by-point.
However, as the spatio-temporal complexity of many absorbing tissue structures
is rather low, the data recorded in such a conventional, regularly sampled
fashion is often highly redundant. We demonstrate that combining variational
image reconstruction methods using spatial sparsity constraints with the
development of novel PAT acquisition systems capable of sub-sampling the
acoustic wave field can dramatically increase the acquisition speed while
maintaining a good spatial resolution: First, we describe and model two general
spatial sub-sampling schemes. Then, we discuss how to implement them using the
FP scanner and demonstrate the potential of these novel compressed sensing PAT
devices through simulated data from a realistic numerical phantom and through
measured data from a dynamic experimental phantom as well as from in-vivo
experiments. Our results show that images with good spatial resolution and
contrast can be obtained from highly sub-sampled PAT data if variational image
reconstruction methods that describe the tissues structures with suitable
sparsity-constraints are used. In particular, we examine the use of total
variation regularization enhanced by Bregman iterations. These novel
reconstruction strategies offer new opportunities to dramatically increase the
acquisition speed of PAT scanners that employ point-by-point sequential
scanning as well as reducing the channel count of parallelized schemes that use
detector arrays.

morphology can be controlled by using a nematic elastomer substrate, we develop
the theory of small-amplitude wrinkles of an isotropic film atop a nematic
elastomer. The directors of the nematic elastomer are assumed to lie in a plane
parallel to the plane of the undeformed film. For uniaxial compression of the
film along the direction perpendicular to the elastomer directors, the system
behaves as a compressed film on an isotropic substrate. When the uniaxial
compression is along the direction of nematic order, we find that the soft
elasticity characteristic of liquid crystal elastomers leads to a critical
stress for wrinkling which is very small compared to the case of an isotropic
substrate. We also determine the wavelength of the wrinkles at the critical
stress, and show how the critical stress and wavelength depend on substrate
depth and the anisotropy of the polymer chains in the nematic elastomer.

been studied intensively in the literature. Under various performance metrics,
the ultimate performance of secondary devices are eventually dictated by the
presumed channel idle time distribution. Such distributions can take any
arbitrary form in practice. In this work, we study idle time distributions in
wireless local area networks (WLAN) using large amount of the channel idle time
data collected in real-world WLAN networks. We demonstrate with experimental
data that the channel idle time distribution can be closely modeled by
hyper-exponential distribution. Furthermore, one can treat the primary packet
arrival process as a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Several secondary
transmission strategies are discussed under this model. It is shown that using
only one hyper-exponential distribution, the secondary user can achieve a
desirable performance when the primary packet arrival process is stationary.
However, experimental data suggests that in practice, this process is not
stationary and the secondary user can experience a large performance loss with
stationary transmission strategy. We propose a novel transmission strategy that
achieves suboptimal secondary user performance when the idle time distribution
is not stationary. The performances of secondary transmission strategies are
demonstrated using experimental data.

  estimating causal effects","Work originally included in PhD Thesis, May 2014, MIT",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.AP stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the absence of unobserved confounders, matching and weighting methods are
widely used to estimate causal quantities including the Average Treatment
Effect on the Treated (ATT). Unfortunately, these methods do not necessarily
achieve their goal of making the multivariate distribution of covariates for
the control group identical to that of the treated, leaving some (potentially
multivariate) functions of the covariates with different means between the two
groups. When these ""imbalanced"" functions influence the non-treatment potential
outcome, the conditioning on observed covariates fails, and ATT estimates may
be biased. Kernel balancing, introduced here, targets a weaker requirement for
unbiased ATT estimation, specifically, that the expected non-treatment
potential outcome for the treatment and control groups are equal. The
conditional expectation of the non-treatment potential outcome is assumed to
fall in the space of functions associated with a choice of kernel, implying a
set of basis functions in which this regression surface is linear. Weights are
then chosen on the control units such that the treated and control group have
equal means on these basis functions. As a result, the expectation of the
non-treatment potential outcome must also be equal for the treated and control
groups after weighting, allowing unbiased ATT estimation by subsequent
difference in means or an outcome model using these weights. Moreover, the
weights produced are (1) precisely those that equalize a particular
kernel-based approximation of the multivariate distribution of covariates for
the treated and control, and (2) equivalent to a form of stabilized inverse
propensity score weighting, though it does not require assuming any model of
the treatment assignment mechanism. An R package, KBAL, is provided to
implement this approach.

sky were restricted by either an energy threshold above a few hundred TeV or
poor neutrino angular resolution. Here we present a search for southern sky
point sources with greatly improved sensitivities to neutrinos with energies
below 100 TeV. By selecting charged-current $\nu_{\mu}$ interacting inside the
detector, we reduce the atmospheric background while retaining efficiency for
astrophysical neutrino-induced events reconstructed with sub-degree angular
resolution. The new event sample covers three years of detector data and leads
to a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity to point sources emitting below
100 TeV in the southern sky. No statistically significant evidence of point
sources was found, and upper limits are set on neutrino emission from
individual sources. A posteriori analysis of the highest-energy ~100 TeV

form, free of game theory terminology. On the other hand, inspired by this
formalism, we state and prove a {\it multilinear minimax theorem}, a
generalization of von Neumann's bilinear minimax theorem. As in the bilinear
case, the proof is based on relating the underlying optimizations to a
primal-dual pair of linear programming problems, albeit more complicated LPs.
The theorem together with its proof is of independent interest. Next, we use
the theorem to associate to a multilinear form in NE a {\it multilinear minimax
relaxation} (MMR), where the primal-dual pair of solutions induce an
approximate equilibrium point that provides a nontrivial upper bound on a
convex combination of {\it expected payoffs} in any NE solution. In fact we
show any positive probability vector associated to the players induces a
corresponding {\it diagonally-scaled} MMR approximate equilibrium with its
associated upper bound. By virtue of the proof of the multilinear minimax
theorem, MMR solution can be computed in polynomial-time. On the other hand, it
is known that even in bimatrix games NE is {\it PPAD-complete}, a complexity
class in NP not known to be in P. The quality of MMR solution and the
efficiency of solving the underlying LPs are the subject of further
investigation. However, as shown in a separate article, for a large set of test
problems in bimatrix games, not only the MMR payoffs for both players are
better than any NE payoffs, so is the computing time of MMR in contrast with
that of Lemke-Howsen algorithm. In large size problems the latter algorithm
even fails to produce a Nash equilibrium. In summary, solving MMR provides a

contact sensors to reliably manipulate a movable object on a cluttered
tabletop. We formulate contact manipulation as a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) in the joint space of robot configurations and object
poses. The POMDP formulation enables the robot to actively gather information
and reduce the uncertainty on the object pose. Further, it incorporates all
major constraints for robot manipulation: kinematic reachability,
self-collision, and collision with obstacles. To solve the POMDP, we apply
DESPOT, a state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithm. Our approach leverages two
key ideas for computational efficiency. First, it performs lazy construction of
a configuration-space lattice by interleaving construction of the lattice and
online POMDP planning. Second, it combines online and offline POMDP planning by
solving relaxed POMDP offline and using the solution to guide the online search
algorithm. We evaluated the proposed approach on a seven degree-of-freedom
robot arm in simulation environments. It significantly outperforms several
existing algorithms, including some commonly used heuristics for contact
manipulation under uncertainty.

long-standing challenge to our understanding of Ice Giant planets. Here we
present the first Uranus structure and evolution models that are constructed to
agree with both the observed low luminosity and the gravity field data. Our
models make use of modern ab initio equations of state at high pressures for
the icy components water, methane, and ammonia. Proceeding step by step, we
confirm that adiabatic models yield cooling times that are too long, even when
uncertainties in the ice:rock ratio (I:R) are taken into account. We then argue
that the transition between the ice/rock-rich interior and the H/He-rich outer
envelope should be stably stratified. Therefore, we introduce a simple thermal
boundary and adjust it to reproduce the low luminosity. Due to this thermal
boundary, the deep interior of the Uranus models are up to 2--3 warmer than
adiabatic models, necessitating the presence of rocks in the deep interior with
a possible I:R of $1\times$ solar. Finally, we allow for an equilibrium
evolution (Teff ~ Teq) that begun prior to the present day, which would
therefore no longer require the current era to be a ""special time"" in Uranus'
evolution. In this scenario, the thermal boundary leads to more rapid cooling
of the outer envelope. When Teff ~ Teq is reached, a shallow, subadiabatic zone
in the atmosphere begins to develop. Its depth is adjusted to meet the
luminosity constraint. This work provides a simple foundation for future Ice
Giant structure and evolution models, that can be improved by properly treating
the heat and particle fluxes in the diffusive zones.

  Transactions on Networking",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many sequential decision-making problems in communication networks can be
modeled as contextual bandit problems, which are natural extensions of the
well-known multi-armed bandit problem. In contextual bandit problems, at each
time, an agent observes some side information or context, pulls one arm and
receives the reward for that arm. We consider a stochastic formulation where
the context-reward tuples are independently drawn from an unknown distribution
in each trial. Motivated by networking applications, we analyze a setting where
the reward is a known non-linear function of the context and the chosen arm's
current state. We first consider the case of discrete and finite context-spaces
and propose DCB($\epsilon$), an algorithm that we prove, through a careful
analysis, yields regret (cumulative reward gap compared to a distribution-aware
genie) scaling logarithmically in time and linearly in the number of arms that
are not optimal for any context, improving over existing algorithms where the
regret scales linearly in the total number of arms. We then study continuous
context-spaces with Lipschitz reward functions and propose CCB($\epsilon,
\delta$), an algorithm that uses DCB($\epsilon$) as a subroutine.
CCB($\epsilon, \delta$) reveals a novel regret-storage trade-off that is
parametrized by $\delta$. Tuning $\delta$ to the time horizon allows us to
obtain sub-linear regret bounds, while requiring sub-linear storage. By
exploiting joint learning for all contexts we get regret bounds for
CCB($\epsilon, \delta$) that are unachievable by any existing contextual bandit
algorithm for continuous context-spaces. We also show similar performance
bounds for the unknown horizon case.

at most comparable to the gamma in the GRB one. Therefore no hadronic GRB,
fireball or hadronic thin precessing jet, escaping exploding star in tunneled

here, based on a purely electronic progenitor jet, fed by neutrons (and relics)

explain unsolved puzzles such as the existence of the X-ray precursor in many

of strong magnetic field in both weakly and strongly coupled regimes. In weakly
coupled regime, we compute $\hat q$ in perturbative QCD at complete leading
order (that is, leading log as well as the constant under the log) in QCD
coupling constant $\alpha_s$, assuming the hierarchy of scales $\alpha_s eB\ll
T^2\ll eB$. We consider two cases of jet orientations with respect to the
magnetic field: 1) the case of jet moving parallel to the magnetic field, 2)
the case jet moving perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the former case, we
find $\hat q\sim \alpha_s^2 (eB)T\log(1/\alpha_s)$, while in the latter we have
$\hat q\sim \alpha_s^2 (eB)T\log(T^2/\alpha_seB)$. In both cases, this leading
order result arises from the scatterings with thermally populated lowest Landau
level quarks. In strongly coupled regime described by AdS/CFT correspondence,
we find $\hat q\sim \sqrt{\lambda}(eB)T$ or $\hat
q\sim\sqrt{\lambda}\sqrt{eB}T^2$ in the same hierarchy of $T^2\ll eB$ depending
on whether the jet is moving parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field,
respectively, which indicates a universal dependence of $\hat q$ on $(eB)T$ in
both regimes for the parallel case, the origin of which should be the
transverse density of lowest Landau level states proportional to $eB$. Finally,
the asymmetric transverse momentum diffusion in the case of jet moving
perpendicular to the magnetic field may give an interesting azimuthal asymmetry
of the gluon Bremsstrahlung spectrum in the BDMPS-Z formalism.

importance sampling, we derive a necessary condition for optimal sensor
decision rules in the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost
function. Then, a Gauss-Seidel/person-by-person optimization algorithm can be
obtained to search the optimal sensor decision rules. It is proved that the
discretized algorithm is finitely convergent. The complexity of the new
algorithm is $O(LN)$ compared with $O(LN^L)$ of the previous algorithm where
$L$ is the number of sensors and $N$ is a constant. Thus, the proposed methods
allows us to design the large sensor networks with general high-dimension
dependent observations. Furthermore, an interesting result is that, for the
fixed AND or OR fusion rules, we can analytically derive the optimal solution
in the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost function. In general,
the solution of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is only local optimal. However, in
the new framework, we can prove that the solution of Gauss-Seidel algorithm is

networks can show metastability, resembling an endemic equilibrium. In a
general setting, the metastable state may involve a large portion of the

Localized infections are not interesting because a true outbreak concerns
network--wide invasion of the contact graph rather than localized infection of
certain sites within the contact network. Existing approaches to localization
phenomenon suffer from a major drawback: they fully rely on the steady--state
solution of mean--field approximate models in the neighborhood of their phase
transition point, where their approximation accuracy is worst; as statistical
physics tells us. We propose a dispersion entropy measure that quantifies the
localization of infections in a generic contact graph. Formulating a maximum
entropy problem, we find an upper bound for the dispersion entropy of the
possible metastable state in the exact SIS process. As a result, we find
sufficient conditions such that any initial infection over the network either
dies out or reaches a localized metastable state. Unlike existing studies
relying on the solution of mean--field approximate models, our investigation of
epidemic localization is based on characteristics of exact SIS equations. Our
proposed method offers a new paradigm in studying spreading processes over
complex networks.

squared of the pion electromagnetic form fac tor, brings a relatively large
contribution to the theoretical error, since the low accuracy of experimental
measurements in this region is amplified by the drastic increase of the
integration kernel. We derive stringent constraints on the two-pion
contribution by exploiting analyticity and unitarity of the pion
electromagnetic form factor. To avoid the poor knowledge of the modulus of this
function, we use instead its phase, known with high precision in the elastic
region from Roy equations for pion-pion scattering via the Fermi-Watson
theorem. Above the inelastic threshold we adopt a conservative integral
condition on the modulus, determined from data and perturbative QCD. Additional
high precision data on the modulus in the range $0.65-0.71$ GeV, obtained from
$e^+e^-$ annihilation and $\tau$-decay experiments, are used to improve the
predictions on the modulus at lower energies by means of a parametrization-free
analytic extrapolation. The results are optimal for a given input and do not
depend on the unknown phase of the form factor above the inelastic threshold.
The present work improves a previous analysis based on the same technique,
including more experimental data and employing better statistical tools for
their treatment. We obtain for the contribution to $a_\mu$ from below 0.63 GeV

general wireless interference network with caches equipped at all transmitters
and receivers. The tradeoff is characterized by an information-theoretic
metric, \emph{normalized delivery time} (NDT), which is the worst-case delivery
time of the actual traffic load at a transmission rate specified by degrees of
freedom (DoF) of a given channel. We obtain both an achievable upper bound and
a theoretical lower bound of the minimum NDT for any number of transmitters,
any number of receivers, and any feasible cache size tuple. We show that the
achievable NDT is exactly optimal in certain cache size regions, and is within
a bounded multiplicative gap to the theoretical lower bound in other regions.
In the achievability analysis, we first propose a novel cooperative
transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy. It offers the freedom to adjust
file splitting ratios for NDT minimization. We then propose a delivery strategy
which transforms the considered interference network into a new class of
cooperative X-multicast channels. It leverages local caching gain, coded
multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain (via interference alignment
and interference neutralization) opportunistically. Finally, the achievable NDT
is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. This study reveals that
with caching at both transmitter and receiver sides, the network can benefit
simultaneously from traffic load reduction and transmission rate enhancement,
thereby effectively reducing the content delivery latency.

The third scheme is based on joint source-channel coding obtained by extending
the Ozarow-Leung (OL) transmission scheme, which applies uncoded linear
transmission. Numerical simulations show that despite its simplicity, the
energy-distortion tradeoff of the OL-based scheme is close to that of the
better separation-based scheme, which indicates that the OL scheme is

wave (mmWave) systems. One explanation is the highly directional transmission
in mmWave, which reduces the interference caused by one network on the other
networks sharing the same resources. In this paper, we model a mmWave cellular
system where an operator that primarily owns an exclusive-use license of a
certain band can sell a restricted secondary license of the same band to
another operator. This secondary network has a restriction on the maximum
interference it can cause to the original network. Using stochastic geometry,
we derive expressions for the coverage and rate of both networks, and establish
the feasibility of secondary licensing in licensed mmWave bands. To explain
economic trade-offs, we consider a revenue-pricing model for both operators in
the presence of a central licensing authority. Our results show that the
original operator and central network authority can benefit from secondary
licensing when the maximum interference threshold is properly adjusted. This
means that the original operator and central licensing authority have an
incentive to permit a secondary network to restrictively share the spectrum.
Our results also illustrate that the spectrum sharing gains increase with
narrow beams and when the network densifies.

Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect in our luminosity-redshift sub-samples, and argue that
such an effect is due to a decrease in the covering factor of a distant
obscuring torus with increasing X-ray luminosity. By comparing the distribution
of the reflection fraction, the ratio of the normalization of the reflected
component to the direct radiation, we find that the low-luminosity,
low-redshift sub-sample had systematically higher reflection fraction values
than the high-redshift, high-luminosity one. On the other hand, no significant
difference is found between samples having similar luminosity but different
redshift, suggesting that the structure of the torus does not evolve strongly
with redshift. Contrary to previous works, we do not find evidence for an
increasing photon index at high Eddington ratio. This may be an indication that
the structure of the accretion disc changes as the Eddington ratio approaches
unity. Comparing our X-ray spectral analysis results with the optical spectral
classification, we find that $\sim20$ per cent of optical type-1 AGN show an
X-ray absorbing column density higher than $10^{21.5}\,\rm{cm^{-2}}$, and about
50 per cent of type-2 AGN have an X-ray absorbing column density less than
$10^{21.5}\,\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We suggest that the excess X-ray absorption shown in
the high-luminosity optical type-1 AGN can be due to small-scale dust-free gas
within (or close to) the broad line region, while in the low-luminosity ones it
can be due to a clumpy torus with a large covering factor.

level of two standard deviations. We find no significant correlation between
$\beta_{\mathrm{s}}$ and foregrounds parameters, with the exception of the
point sources amplitude at $143\,\mathrm{GHz}$, $A^{PS}_{143}$, which shifts by
half sigma when the running of the running is considered. We further study the
cosmological implications of such preference for
$\alpha_\mathrm{s},\beta_\mathrm{s}\sim0.01$ by including in the analysis the

neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}$. We find that when the running of the running is

$A_L = 1$ and $\Omega_k = 0$ but still hint at possible deviations. The
indication for $\beta_\mathrm{s} > 0$ survives at two standard deviations when
external datasets such as BAO and CFHTLenS are included in the analysis, and
persists at $\sim 1.7$ standard deviations when CMB lensing is considered. We
discuss the possibility of constraining $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ with current and
future measurements of CMB spectral distortions, showing that an experiment
like PIXIE could provide strong constraints on $\alpha_\mathrm{s}$ and
$\beta_\mathrm{s}$.

predictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for the nearest-neighbor spacing

parameter $\omega$, which takes the value $\omega=0$ for regular systems and
$\omega \simeq 1$ for chaotic systems. We obtain $\omega=0.85 \pm 0.02$ which
is, to our knowledge, the closest value to chaos ever observed in experimental
bound states of nuclei. By contrast, the results for unnatural parity states
are far from RMT behavior. We interpret these results as a consequence of the
strength of the residual interaction in $^{208}$Pb, which, according to
experimental data, is much stronger for natural than for unnatural parity
states. In addition our results show that chaotic and non-chaotic nuclear
states coexist in the same energy region of the spectrum.

on the wide range of applications in atomic and molecular physics (including
atom optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, formation of ultracold molecules,
precision experiments, etc.), quantum information (including single- and
two-qubit gates, entangled-state preparation, etc.), solid-state physics
(including processes in doped crystals, nitrogen-vacancy centers,

studied in a non Markovian framework. The device is constructed from a molecule
connected to a hot and cold reservoir. The heat baths are modelled using the
stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian method. The molecule is modelled by an
asymmetric double-well potential. Each well is semi-locally connected to a heat
bath composed of spins. The dynamics is driven by a combined system-bath
Hamiltonian. The temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath
composed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium. A random swap operation
exchange spins between the primary and secondary baths. The combined system is
studied in various system-bath coupling strengths. In all cases the average
heat current always flows from the hot towards the cold bath in accordance to
the second law of thermodynamics. The asymmetry of the double well generates a
rectifying effect meaning that when the left and right baths are exchanged the
heat current follows the hot to cold direction. The heat current is larger when
the high frequency is coupled to the hot bath. Adding an external driving field
can reverse the transport direction. Such a refrigeration effect is modelled by
a periodic driving field in resonance with the frequency difference of the two
potential wells. A minimal driving amplitude is required to overcome the heat
leak effect. In the strong driving regime the cooling power is non-monotonic

requires a comprehensive picture of the maldistribution of the working fluid
and uniformity of cooling within the same. In this article, detailed
simulations employing parallel micro channel systems with specialized
manifold-channel configurations i.e. U, I and Z have been performed. Eulerian
Lagrangian Discrete Phase Model and Effective Property Model with water and
alumina water nanofluid as working fluids have been employed. The distributions
of the dispersed particulate phase and continuous phase have been observed to
be, in general, different from the flow distribution and this has been found to
be strongly dependent on the flow configuration. Particle maldistribution has
been conclusively shown to be influenced by various migration and diffusive
phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian motion, thermophoretic drift, etc. To
understand the uniformity of cooling within the device, which is of importance
in real time scenario, an appropriate figure of merit has been proposed. It has
been observed that uniformity of cooling improved using nanofluid as working
fluid as well as enhanced relative cooling in hot zones, providing evidence of
the smart nature of such dispersions. To further quantify this smart effect,
real time mimicking hot-spot scenarios have been computationally probed with
nanofluid as the coolant. A silicon-based microchip emitting non-uniform heat
flux (gathered from real-time monitoring of an Intel Core i7 4770 3.40 GHz quad

identify optimal adaptive designs which improve previous designs in two ways:
Firstly, designs can be found exhibiting lower expected sample size under the

introduced witness condition, which controls the upper tail. The parameter $v$

iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The
3rd and 5th harmonic signals from SPIONs mixed with blood induced by AMF were
detected using a gradiometer coil. Blood coagulation was induced artificially
by adding CaCl2 solution to whole blood of sheep at various temperatures and
hematocrits. We calculated the coagulation rate (k) and normalized signal
intensity at infinite time (Sinf) by fitting the time course of the normalized
3rd harmonic signal to S(t)=(1-Sinf)exp(-kt)+Sinf. The k values increased
significantly with increasing temperature and decreased significantly with
increasing hematocrit. The Sinf values decreased significantly with increasing
temperature and tended to increase with increasing hematocrit. Blood
anticoagulation was induced by adding heparin to the whole blood sampled from
mice. There were significant differences in both the 3rd and 5th harmonic
signals between groups with and without heparin at 25 min or more after adding
heparin. We also calculated the 3rd and 5th harmonic signals for viscosities
ranging from 0.001 to 1 kg/m/s, with an assumption that the magnetization and
particle size distribution of SPIONs obey the Langevin theory of paramagnetism
and log-normal distribution, respectively. The 3rd and 5th harmonic signals
increased slowly with increasing viscosity and had peaks at approximately 0.015
and 0.025 kg/m/s, respectively. After these peaks, they decreased monotonically
with increasing viscosity. These results confirm the rationale of our method.
In conclusion, our method will be useful for measuring blood coagulation and
anticoagulation and for studying their processes.

over a networked system. In an aggregative game, a player's objective is a
function of the aggregate of all the players' decisions. Every player maintains
an estimate of this aggregate, and the players exchange this information with
their local neighbors over a connected network. We study distributed
synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for information exchange and
equilibrium computation over such a network. Under standard conditions, we
establish the almost-sure convergence of the obtained sequences to the
equilibrium point. We also consider extensions of our schemes to aggregative
games where the players' objectives are coupled through a more general form of
aggregate function. Finally, we present numerical results that demonstrate the
performance of the proposed schemes.

general semilinear elliptic equation of second order involving $L^1$ functions

existence and uniqueness of `{\it very weak}' solutions to the boundary value
problem for a given $L^1$ function. However, a `{\it very weak}' solution need
not exist when an $L^1$ function is replaced with a measure due to which the

analyze the corrections to the thermodynamics of this system by first relating
the fluctuations in the entropy to the fluctuations in the energy. Then, we
will use the relation between entropy and a conformal field theory to analyze
the fluctuations in the entropy. We will demonstrate that similar physical
results are obtained from both these approaches. We will also study the effect

fundamental physics which assumes a much stronger synergy between cosmology and
quantum physics than exists in contemporary theory. In IST the (quasi-cyclic)
universe $U$ is treated as a deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely
on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $I_U$ of its state space. In this
approach, the geometry of $I_U$, and not a set of differential evolution
equations in space-time $\mathcal M_U$, provides the most primitive description
of the laws of physics. As such, IST is non-classical. The geometry of $I_U$ is
based on Cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic to
the algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. In IST, the
non-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from number
theory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\phi$ and $\cos \phi$. The
complex Hilbert Space and the relativistic Dirac Equation respectively are
shown to describe $I_U$, and evolution on $I_U$, in the singular limit of IST
at $p=\infty$; particle properties such as de Broglie relationships arise from
the helical geometry of trajectories on $I_U$ in the neighbourhood of $\mathcal
M_U$. With the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $I_U$,
certain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to the
more traditional Euclidean metric, take points away from $I_U$ and are
therefore unphysically large. This allows (the $\psi$-epistemic) IST to evade
the Bell and Pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. In
IST, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining the
pseudo-Riemannian metric of $\mathcal M_U$ with the p-adic metric of $I_U$. A
generalisation of the field equations of general relativity which can achieve
this is proposed.

symmetric matter and charged distribution under general relativistic framework.
The model represents a compact star of embedding class one. The solutions
obtain here are general in their nature having the following two features:
firstly, the metric becomes flat and also the expressions for the pressure,
energy density and electric charge become zero in all the cases if we consider
the constant $A=0$, which shows that our solutions represent the so-called
`electromagnetic mass model' \cite{Lorentz1904}, and secondly, the metric
function $\nu(r)$, for the limit $n$ tends to infinity, converts to
$\nu(r)=C{r}^{2}+ ln~B$, which is the same as considered by Maurya et al.
\cite{Maurya2015a}. We have investigated several physical aspects of the model
and find that all the features are acceptable within the demand of the
contemporary theoretical studies and observational evidences.
