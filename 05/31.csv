The better the Hessian approximation the better the convergence. But how good
is a given approximation theoretically? How much are we losing? This paper
addresses that question and proves that for a particularly popular and
empirically strong approximation known as the Gauss-Newton approximation, we
actually lose very little--for a large class of highly expressive objective
terms, the true Hessian actually limits to the Gauss-Newton Hessian quickly as
the trajectory's time discretization becomes small. This result both motivates
it's use and offers insight into computationally efficient design. For
instance, traditional representations of kinetic energy exploit the generalized
inertia matrix whose derivatives are usually difficult to compute. We introduce
here a novel reformulation of rigid body kinetic energy designed explicitly for
fast and accurate curvature calculation. Our theorem proves that the
Gauss-Newton Hessian under this formulation efficiently captures the kinetic
energy curvature, but requires only as much computation as a single evaluation
of the traditional representation. Additionally, we introduce a technique that
exploits these ideas implicitly using Cholesky decompositions for some cases
when similar objective terms reformulations exist but may be difficult to find.
Our experiments validate these findings and demonstrate their use on a
real-world motion optimization system for high-dof motion generation.

how to discriminate these four solutions. Firstly, we find that two of them are
already excluded by the decay $B_c^-\to \tau^-\bar\nu_\tau$, because the
predicted decay widths have already overshot the total width $\Gamma_{B_c}$. It
is then found that the remaining two solutions result in two effective

a sign and enhance the absolute value of the coefficient of $\bar c_L\gamma_\mu
b_L\,\bar \tau_L\gamma^\mu{\nu_\tau}_L$ operator by about $12\%$. However, they
give nearly the same predictions as in the SM for the $D^\ast$ and $\tau$
longitudinal polarizations as well as the lepton forward-backward asymmetries

modulation enters as a complex hopping phase, leading straightforwardly to an
artificial magnetic field upon adding a second dimension. We show that this
artificial gauge field has important consequences, such as the counterintuitive
reduction of average energy under resonant driving, or the realisation of
quantum Hall physics. Our approach offers significant advantages over previous
implementations of synthetic dimensions, providing an intriguing route towards
higher-dimensional topological physics and strongly-correlated states.

scales of around $35$ Mm, commonly referred to as supergranules. Inferring the
sub-surface flow profile of supergranules from measurements of the surface and
photospheric wavefield is an important challenge faced by helioseismology.
Traditionally, the inverse problem has been approached by studying the linear
response of seismic waves in a horizontally translationally invariant
background to the presence of the supergranule; following an iterative approach
that does not depend on horizontal translational invariance might perform
better, since the misfit can be analyzed post iterations. In this work, we
construct synthetic observations using a reference supergranule, and invert for
the flow profile using surface measurements of travel-times of waves belonging
to modal ridges $f$ (surface-gravity) and $p_{1}$ through $p_{7}$ (acoustic).
We study the extent to which individual modes and their combinations contribute
to infer the flow. We show that this method of non-linear iterative inversion
tends to underestimate the flow velocities as well as inferring a shallower
flow profile, with significant deviations from the reference supergranule near
the surface. We carry out a similar analysis for a sound-speed perturbation and
find that analogous near-surface deviations persist, although the iterations
converge faster and more accurately. We conclude that a better approach to
inversion would be to expand the supergranule profile in an appropriate basis,
thereby reducing the number of parameters being inverted for and appropriately
regularizing them.

a diffusion matrix that depends on particle covariance matrices. Besides some

Impact of content at varying granularities, for the purpose of predicting links

The unigram language model performed the best, indicating strong similarity of

are prevalent. Although much has been done to prevent failures, network nodes
and links are bound to fail eventually. Failure recovery processes are
therefore needed. Failure recovery is mainly influenced by (1) detection of the
failure, and (2) circumvention of the detected failure. However, especially in
SDNs where controllers recompute network state reactively, this leads to high
delays. Hence, next to primary rules, backup rules should be installed in the
switches to quickly detour traffic once a failure occurs. In this work, we
propose algorithms for computing an all-to-all primary and backup network
forwarding configuration that is capable of circumventing link and node
failures. Omitting the high delay invoked by controller recomputation through
preconfiguration, our proposal's recovery delay is close to the detection time
which is significantly below the 50 ms rule of thumb. After initial recovery,
we recompute network configuration to guarantee protection from future
failures. Our algorithms use packet-labeling to guarantee correct and shortest
detour forwarding. The algorithms and labeling technique allow packets to
return to the primary path and are able to discriminate between link and node
failures. The computational complexity of our solution is comparable to that of
all-to-all-shortest paths computations. Our experimental evaluation on both
real and generated networks shows that network configuration complexity highly
decreases compared to classic disjoint paths computations. Finally, we provide
a proof-of-concept OpenFlow controller in which our proposed configuration is

underly the right sequence of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow
subsystem steers the fast one back and forth along these paths leading to
bursting behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of
bursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystems. Transitions
between classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow modulation of the model's

possible transitions. This provides a single framework to understand the

far played dominant roles in investigations of asymptotic safety for quantum
gravity. This thesis is devoted to exploring asymptotic safety in infinite
dimensional, or functional, truncations of the effective action as well as the
effects that can be caused by the single field approximation in this context.
It begins with a comprehensive analysis of the three existing flow equations of
the single field f(R) truncation by determining their spaces of global fixed
point solutions and, where applicable, of corresponding eigenoperator
solutions. As a second result, it is then shown that one incarnation of the
single field f(R) approximation actually breaks down in the sense that there is
no physical content left to explore. In order to clarify whether such drastic
findings can be caused by the approximations used in setting up the
renormalisation group flow, we identify the single field approximation as a
prime candidate and show in the more familiar context of scalar field theory
that it can indeed lead to many types of non-physical results. As a way to
avoid such non-physical behaviour we highlight the importance of the previously
known split Ward identity and exemplify its usefulness by fully restoring the
correct physical picture in scalar field theory. Taking this result as evidence
that the split Ward identity may lead to well behaved functional truncations
also in gravity, we derive the flow equations of conformal gravity in a
bi-field truncation of the effective action that goes beyond the local
potential approximation in the fluctuation field. It is found that the split
Ward identity leads to a simplified set of renormalisation group equations for
the conformal factor that, while differing at crucial points, bear close
resemblance to flow equations obtained in scalar field theory.

parameter $\chi$ enters theory always coupled to the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
$r$, e.g. in combination of the form $\chi \cdot r$. Thus, the capability to
detect $\chi$ critically depends on the value of $r$. We find that with present

which $r\sim0.1(0.05)$, the maximal chirality case, i.e. $\chi = \pm1$, could
be detected with a significance of $\sim2.5(1.5)\sigma$ at best. We conclude
that the two-point statistics at the basis of CMB likelihood functions is
currently unable to constrain chirality and may only provide weak limits on
$\chi$ in the most optimistic scenarios. Hence, it is crucial to investigate
the use of other observables, e.g. provided by higher order statistics, to
constrain these kind of parity violating theories with the CMB.

able to put stringent constraints on the amplitude of features, but no

of the experimental reach in constraining such features using 21 cm tomography

with potentially access to a large number of modes. We consider three different
categories of theoretically motivated models: the sharp feature models,
resonance models, and standard clock models. We study the improvements on
bounds on features as a function of the total number of observed modes and
identify parameter degeneracies. The detectability depends critically on the
amplitude, frequency and scale-location of the features, as well as the angular
and redshift resolution of the experiment. We quantify these effects by
considering different fiducial models. Our forecast shows that a cosmic
variance limited 21 cm experiment measuring fluctuations in the redshift range
$30\leq z \leq 100$ with a 0.01-MHz bandwidth and sub-arcminute angular
resolution could potentially improve bounds by several orders of magnitude for

profile within the fluid and, therefore, represents a natural means for
analyzing general, radiation-dominated, relativistic shear flows.

heavy particle sector whose interactions with the inflaton, the lightest state

interactions the heavy sector may contain stable states whose relic abundance
is generated at the end of inflation by the gravity alone. This general
feature, and the absence of any particle physics signal of dark matter so far,
motivates us to look for new directions in the dark sector physics, including
scenarios in which dark matter is super-heavy. In this article we study the
possibility that the dark matter is even heavier than the inflaton, its
existence follows from the inflaton dynamics, and its abundance today is {\it
naturally} determined by the weakness of gravitational interaction. This
implies that the super-heavy dark matter scenarios can be tested via the
measurements of inflationary parameters and/or the CMB isocurvature
perturbations and non-Gaussianities. We explicitly work out details of three
Coleman-Weinberg inflation scenarios, study the systematics of super-heavy dark
matter production in those cases, and compute which parts of the parameter
spaces can be probed by the future CMB measurements.

approximately half a million high-quality galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) allows us to explore this invariance down to a nominal
precision in redshift of one part per million (statistical). Our analysis is
performed over the redshift interval 0.02<z<0.25. We use the centroids of
spectral lines over the 3700-6800\AA\ rest-frame optical window. We do not find
any difference in redshift between the blue and red sides down to a precision

wavelength-independence of the (1+z) redshift law is confirmed over a wide
spectral window at this precision level. This result holds independently of the
stellar population of the galaxies and their kinematical properties. This
result is also robust against wavelength calibration issues. The limited
spectral resolution (R~2000) of the SDSS data combined with the asymmetric
wavelength sampling of the spectral features in the observed restframe due to
the (1+z) stretching of the lines prevent our methodology to achieve a
precision higher than 10$^{-5}$, at z>0.1. Future attempts to constrain this

potentials the truncation scale, $a_t$, is mainly governed by (i) the mass
enclosed within the dwarf half-light radius ($R_h$) and (ii) the slope of the
DM halo profile at $R\approx R_h$, and is largely independent of the initial
eccentricity distribution of the binary systems and the anisotropy of the
stellar orbits about the galactic potential. For the reported velocity
dispersion and half-light radius of Segue I, the closest ultra-faint, our
models predict $a_t$ values that are a factor 2--3 smaller in cuspy haloes than

distribution function of a tracer population should be independent of time

is spherical. We study the limitations of such modelling by applying a general
dynamical model with minimal assumptions to a large sample of galactic haloes
from cosmological $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations. Using dark matter
particles as dynamical tracers, we find that the systematic uncertainties in
the measured mass and concentration parameters typically have an amplitude of
25% to 40%. When stars are used as tracers, however, the systematic
uncertainties can be as large as a factor of $2-3$. The systematic
uncertainties are not reduced by increasing the tracer sample size and vary
stochastically from halo to halo. These systematic uncertainties are mostly
driven by underestimated statistical noise caused by correlated phase-space
structures that violate the steady state assumption. The number of independent
phase-space structures inferred from the uncertainty level sets a limiting
sample size beyond which a further increase no longer significantly improves
the accuracy of dynamical inferences. The systematic uncertainty level is
determined by the halo merger history, the shape and environment of the halo.
Our conclusions apply generally to any spherical steady-state model.

component-separation method, the so-called generalized needlet internal linear

produce significantly improved all-sky maps of Planck thermal dust emission,

contamination of the thermal dust maps, we provide more accurate estimates of
the local dust temperature and dust spectral index over the sky with reduced
dispersion, especially at high Galactic latitudes above $b = \pm 20{\deg}$. We
find that the dust temperature is $T = (19.4 \pm 1.3)$ K and the dust spectral
index is $\beta = 1.6 \pm 0.1$ averaged over the whole sky, while $T = (19.4

Moreover, subtracting the new CIB-removed thermal dust maps from the
CMB-removed Planck maps gives access to the CIB anisotropies over 60 % of the
sky at Galactic latitudes $|b| > 20{\deg}$. Because they are a significant
improvement over previous Planck products, the GNILC maps are recommended for
thermal dust science. The new CIB maps can be regarded as indirect tracers of
the dark matter and they are recommended for exploring cross-correlations with
lensing and large-scale structure optical surveys. The reconstructed GNILC
thermal dust and CIB maps are delivered as Planck products.

circumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by
sub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad

Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) require theoretical descriptions of the complete
event in a neutrino-nucleus reaction. Since nuclear targets are used this
requires a good understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions.
  Purpose: Develop a consistent theory and code framework for the description
of lepton-nucleus interactions that can be used to describe not only inclusive
cross sections, but also the complete final state of the reaction.
  Methods: The Giessen-Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation of
quantum-kinetic transport theory is used, with improvements in its treatment of
the nuclear ground state and of 2p2h interactions. For the latter an empirical
structure function from electron scattering data is used as a basis.
  Results: Results for electron-induced inclusive cross sections are given as a
necessary check for the overall quality of this approach. The calculated
neutrino-induced inclusive double-differential cross sections show good
agreement with data from neutrino- and antineutrino reactions for different
neutrino flavors at MiniBooNE and T2K. Inclusive double-differential cross
sections for MicroBooNE, NOvA, MINERvA and LBNF/DUNE are given.
  Conclusions: Based on the GiBUU model of lepton-nucleus descriptions a good
theoretical description of inclusive electron-, neutrino- and
antineutrino-nucleus data over a wide range of energies, different neutrino
flavors and different experiments is now possible. Since no tuning is involved
this theory and code should be reliable also for new energy regimes and target

from theoretical studies of the one-triplet dispersion in unfrustrated chains

highly frustrated two-dimensional material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ show an almost

apparent multi-triplet excitations. We investigate these questions in the
frustrated spin ladder and present numerical results from exact diagonalization
for the dynamical structure factor as a function of temperature. We find
anomalously rapid transfer of spectral weight out of the one-triplet band and
into both broad and sharp spectral features at a wide range of energies,
including below the zero-temperature gap of this excitation. These features are
multi-triplet bound states, which develop particularly strongly near the

account for the properties of BHs in today's galaxies, notably why some
galaxies host a BH, and others do not. We investigate the formation,
distribution and growth of BH `seeds' by using the adaptive mesh refinement
code Ramses. We develop an implementation of BH formation in dense,
low-metallicity environments, as advocated by models invoking the collapse of
the first generation of stars, or of dense nuclear star clusters. The seed
masses are computed one-by-one on-the-fly, based on the star formation rate and
the stellar initial mass function. This self-consistent method to seed BHs
allows us to study the distribution of BHs in a cosmological context and their
evolution over cosmic time. We find that all high-mass galaxies tend to a host
a BH, whereas low-mass counterparts have a lower probability of hosting a BH.
After the end of the epoch of BH formation, this probability is modulated by
the growth of the galaxy. The simulated BHs connect to low-redshift
observational samples, and span a similar range in accretion properties as
Lyman-Break Analogs. The growth of BHs in low-mass galaxies is stunted by
strong supernova feedback. The properties of BHs in dwarf galaxies thus remain
a testbed for BH formation. Simulations with strong supernova feedback, which
is able to quench BH accretion in shallow potential wells, produce galaxies and
BHs in better agreement with observational constraints.

orphan-radio afterglows extending over wider angles on timescales of weeks.
Based on the derived light curves, we suggest an optimized survey at $1.4$ GHz

typically show featureless optical spectra that make it difficult to estimate
the redshift. A novel method for estimating the redshift of BL Lac objects has
recently been proposed which assumes that these objects typically reside in
groups of galaxies.
  Aims: The aim of this work is to estimate the fraction of BL Lac objects that
reside in groups of galaxies.
  Methods: We use a sample of groups (M12 catalogue) selected by applying a
friends-of-friends algorithm in the SDSS DR12. Galaxies in the M12 sample were
cross-correlated with the sample of blazars in the BZCAT.
  Results: We found that 121 galaxies in the M12 catalogue are blazars in the
BZCAT sample, all but one are BL Lac objects, and a large fraction are
classified as BL Lac-galaxy dominated. Analysing the fraction of galaxies in
groups as a function of redshift we have estimated a correction factor that
takes into account the typical incompleteness of the catalogues based on the
friends-of-friends algorithm. Once this factor was applied to the sample of BL
Lac objects with a counterpart in the M12 catalogue, we found that the
percentage of BL Lac objects in groups is $\gtrsim 67 \pm 8\%$.
  Conclusions: The high rate of BL Lac objects in groups found in this work
strongly supports a recent method that has successfully estimated the redshift
of BL Lac objects with featureless spectra.

black hole binaries out to cosmological distances. Gravitational wave bursts
from high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 1$) can be strongly magnified by gravitational
lensing due to intervening galaxies along the line of sight. In the absence of
electromagnetic counterparts, the mergers' intrinsic mass scale and redshift
are degenerate with the unknown magnification factor $\mu$. Hence, strongly
magnified low-mass mergers from high redshifts appear as higher-mass mergers
from lower redshifts. We assess the impact of this degeneracy on the
mass-redshift distribution of observable events for generic models of binary
black hole formation from normal stellar evolution, Pop III star remnants, or a
primordial black hole population. We find that strong magnification ($\mu
\gtrsim 3$) generally creates a heavy tail of apparently massive mergers in the
event distribution from a given detector. For LIGO and its future upgrades,
this tail may dominate the population of intrinsically massive, but unlensed
mergers in binary black hole formation models involving normal stellar
evolution or primordial black holes. Modeling the statistics of lensing
magnification can help account for this magnification bias when testing
astrophysical scenarios of black hole binary formation and evolution.

carefully tuning the pseudo-temperature (needed to randomize the

paradigmatic optimization problems, such as the maximum satisfiability problem

harden the observed spectrum, so that spectral modeling tends to infer radii

  We simulated the effects of a hot spot on the pulsed fraction and spectrum of
the quiescent NSs X5 and X7 in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, using
appropriate spectra and beaming for hydrogen atmosphere models, incorporating
special and general relativistic effects, and sampling a range of system

hot spots below our pulsation limit could bias the spectroscopically inferred

They have received little
attention mostly as a consequence of their low luminosities; this situation has
changed recently and Class I masers are now routinely used as signposts of
outflows. The recent detection of polarisation in Class I lines now makes it
possible to obtain information on magnetic fields in shocks. We make use of
newly calculated collisional rates to investigate the excitation of Class I
masers and to reconcile their observed properties with model results. We
performed LVG calculations with a plane-parallel slab geometry to compute the
pump and loss rates which regulate the interactions of the different maser
systems with the maser reservoir. We study the dependence of the pump rate, the
loss rate, and the inversion efficiency of the pumping scheme of Class I masers
on the physics of the gas. Bright Class I masers are mainly high-temperature
high-density structures with maser emission measures corresponding to high
CH$_3$OH abundances close to the limits set by collisional quenching. Our model
reproduces reasonably well most of the observed properties of Class I masers.
The 25 GHz masers are the most sensitive to the density and mase at higher
densities than other lines. Moreover, even at high density and high abundance,
their luminosity is lower than that of the 44 GHz and 36 GHz lines. By
comparison between observed isotropic photon luminosities and our model, we
infer beam solid angles of ~0.001 steradian. Class I masers can be separated
into 3 families: the $(J+1)_{-1}-J_{0}$-E type, the $(J+1)_0-J_1$-A type, and
the $J_2-J_1$-E lines. The 25 GHz lines behave in a different fashion from the
other masers as they are only inverted at densities above $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ in

$1.1\times 10^{-8}\rightarrow 2.3\times 10^{-10}$ respectively. These ranges

present a detailed analysis of this class of processes, identifying the form of
the leading initial-state collinear logarithms that allow the relation of
calculations performed in different flavour schemes in a simple and reliable
way. This procedure makes it possible to assess the size of the logarithmically
enhanced terms and the effects of their resummation via heavy-quark parton

important effects of the resummation are a shift of the central predictions

all linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations,
as well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken
into account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino
fraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of
neutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory.
Then the ""bare"" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the
neutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to
the gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for
the ""bare"" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing
exact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly
derive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the
linear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction,
and derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive
neutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a
sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction
formulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion
of massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.

robustness to transmission errors and their resilience to noise. Equiangular
tight frames (ETFs) are particularly useful and have been shown to be optimal
for transmission under a certain number of erasures. Unfortunately, ETFs do not
exist in many cases and are hard to construct when they do exist. However, it
is known that an ETF of d+1 vectors in a d dimensional space always exists.
This paper gives an explicit construction of ETFs of d+1 vectors in a d
dimensional space. This construction works for both real and complex cases and
is simpler than existing methods. The absence of ETFs of arbitrary sizes in a
given space leads to generalizations of ETFs. One way to do so is to consider
tight frames where the set of (acute) angles between pairs of vectors has k
distinct values. This paper presents a construction of tight frames such that
for a given value of k, the angles between pairs of vectors take at most k
distinct values. These tight frames can be related to regular graphs and
association schemes.

of integral decomposability and, respectively, the opposite notion of integral

transcendental motive is indecomposable rationally, then it is indecomposable
integrally. For example, $M^2_{\rm tr}(S)$ is rationally, and hence integrally
indecomposable if $S$ is an algebraic $K3$-surface whose motive is known to be
finite-dimensional. In the paper we prove that $M^2_{\rm tr}(S)$ is integrally

solvers for these theories, such as Z3str2, CVC4, and S3, are of immense
practical value in exposing security vulnerabilities in string-intensive

complexity-theoretic questions in the context of theories over strings that are

applications and open questions, we study a first-order, many-sorted,
quantifier-free theory $T_{s,n}$ of string equations, linear arithmetic over
string length, and string-number conversion predicate and prove three theorems.
First, we prove that the satisfiability problem for the theory $T_{s,n}$ is
undecidable via a reduction from a theory of linear arithmetic over natural
numbers with power predicate, we call power arithmetic. Second, we show that
the string-numeric conversion predicate is expressible in terms of the power
predicate, string equations, and length function. This second theorem, in
conjunction with the reduction we propose for the undecidability theorem,
suggests that the power predicate is expressible in terms of word equations and
length function if and only if the string-numeric conversion predicate is also
expressible in the same fragment. Such results are very useful tools in
comparing the expressive power of different theories, and for establishing
decidability and complexity results. Third, we provide a consistent
axiomatization ${\Gamma}$ for the functions and predicates of $T_{s,n}$.
Additionally, we prove that the theory $T_{\Gamma}$ , obtained via logical

bit-vector arithmetic aimed at formal verification, automated testing, and

solver is the observation that existing string solvers are not efficient at
modeling the string/bit-vector combination. Current approaches either reduce
strings to bit-vectors and use a bit-vector solver as a backend, or model
bit-vectors as natural numbers and use a solver for the combined theory of
strings and natural numbers. Both these approaches are inefficient for
different reasons. Modeling strings as bit-vectors destroys structure inherent
in string equations thus missing opportunities for efficiently deciding such
formulas, and modeling bit-vectors as natural numbers is known to be
inefficient. Hence, there is a clear need for a solver that models strings and
bit-vectors natively.
  Our solver Z3strBV is a decision procedure for the theory $T_{w,bv}$
combining solvers for bit-vector and string equations. We demonstrate
experimentally that Z3strBV is significantly more efficient than reduction of
string/bit-vector constraints to strings/natural numbers. Additionally, we
prove decidability for the theory $T_{w,bv}$. We also propose two optimizations
which can be adapted to other contexts. The first accelerates convergence on a
consistent assignment of string lengths, and the second, dubbed library-aware
SMT solving, fixes summaries for built-in string functions (e.g., {\tt strlen}
in C/C++), which Z3strBV uses directly instead of analyzing the functions from
scratch each time. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that Z3strBV is able
to detect nontrivial overflows in real-world system-level code, as confirmed

than exponential microscopic dynamics, akin to the ones in supercooled liquids

contrasting evidence: dynamics faster than exponential, intermittency, and
abrupt structural changes. Here we use 3D computer simulations of a microscopic
model to reveal that the timescales governing stress relaxation respectively
through thermal fluctuations and elastic recovery are key for the aging
dynamics. When thermal fluctuations are too weak, stress heterogeneities
frozen-in upon solidification can still partially relax through elastically
driven fluctuations. Such fluctuations are intermittent, because of strong
correlations that persist over the timescale of experiments or simulations,
leading to faster than exponential dynamics.

phenomena in suspended materials that has implications for broad technological
applications. Controlling this thickening behavior remains a major challenge
and has led to empirical strategies ranging from altering the particle surfaces
and shape to modifying the solvent properties. However, none of these methods
allow for tuning of flow properties during shear itself. Here, we demonstrate
that by strategic imposition of a high-frequency and low-amplitude shear
perturbation orthogonal to the primary shearing flow, we can largely eradicate
shear thickening. The orthogonal shear effectively becomes a regulator for
controlling thickening in the suspension, allowing the viscosity to be reduced
by up to two decades on demand. In a separate setup, we show that such effects
can be induced by simply agitating the sample transversely to the primary shear
direction. Overall, the ability of in situ manipulation of shear thickening
paves a route towards creating materials whose mechanical properties can be
controlled.

eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation

not directly amenable to incorporating pertinent structural constraints such as
non-negativity and sparsity on the canonical components. We posit regularized

between {\em inexact} solutions of a regularized least squares subproblem and a

can easily handle structure-promoting regularization. We show that the
algorithm globally converges to a critical point at a sublinear rate, and
approaches a global optimal solution at a linear rate when no regularization is

from the electron-ion interaction, rather than as Bloch electrons. This is
inconsistent with the conventional theory of superconductivity and consistent

existing resources. Unfortunately, provisioning timescales are long, the
process is costly, and single-homing means operators cannot balance across the
last mile. Inspired by energy and transport networks, we propose demand-side
management of users to reduce the impact caused by consumption patterns
out-pacing that of edge network provision. By directly affecting user behaviour
through a range of incentives, our techniques enable resource management over
shorter timescales than is possible in conventional networks. Using survey data
from 100 participants we explore the feasibility of introducing the principles

can be revealed by measuring the steady atomic correlations between two ideal
atoms, which interact with the same leaking cavity mode. Considering a weak
atom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity
mode ($\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the
whole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of
correlations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the
cavity field even in the limit of $\bar{n} \gg 1$ [Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{107}, 153601 (2011)]. Here, we extend this result by investigating the
relaxation time for such a system. We have shown that the relaxation time of
the system varies proportionally to $\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but it is
inversely proportional to $\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time
required to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field
on the atomic correlations diverges as $\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values
due to a coherent driving, while it goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a
coherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability,
i.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for
a long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have
also discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady
correlations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity
field is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times.
Then, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness
of a cavity field in a certain time interval.

resonance in the magnetic film creates a time dynamic surface stress of
magnetoelastic origin that acts back on the surface of the piezoelectric and
modifies the SAW propagation. Unlike previous analyses that treat the
excitation as a magnon-phonon polariton, here the magnetoelastic film is
treated as a perturbation modifying boundary conditions on the SAW. We use
acoustical perturbation theory to find closed form expressions for the
back-action surface stress and strain fields and the resultant SAW velocity
shifts and attenuation. We demonstrate that the shear stress fields associated
with this spin-wave back-action also generate effective surface currents on the
piezoelectric both in-phase and out-of-phase with the driving SAW potential.

ellipsoidal surface by computer simulation, where shape evolution leads to a
reduction in area, crowding the particles and preventing further evolution of

evolved iteratively, eventually leading to a rigid metric-jammed state that is
stable with respect to motion of the particles and some specified space of

sub-micron spatial resolution has been achieved previously in scanning SQUID
sensors, our sensors not only achieve high spatial resolution, but also have

to reinterpret popular mortality models such as the Lee-Carter class of models

estimation and forecasting of mortality under a unified framework. Furthermore,
we propose an alternative class of model identification constraints which is
more suited to statistical inference in filtering and parameter estimation
settings based on maximization of the marginalized likelihood or in Bayesian
inference. We then develop a novel class of Bayesian state-space models which
incorporate apriori beliefs about the mortality model characteristics as well
as for more flexible and appropriate assumptions relating to heteroscedasticity
that present in observed mortality data. We show that multiple period and
cohort effect can be cast under a state-space structure. To study long term
mortality dynamics, we introduce stochastic volatility to the period effect.
The estimation of the resulting stochastic volatility model of mortality is
performed using a recent class of Monte Carlo procedure specifically designed
for state and parameter estimation in Bayesian state-space models, known as the
class of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the framework
we have developed using Danish male mortality data, and show that incorporating
heteroscedasticity and stochastic volatility markedly improves model fit
despite an increase of model complexity. Forecasting properties of the enhanced
models are examined with long term and short term calibration periods on the
reconstruction of life tables.

presented by investigating the replicator dynamics with symmetric interactions.
Sparseness of a network involves difficulty in analyzing the fixed points of
the equation, and we avoid this problem by treating large self interaction $u$,
which allows us to construct a perturbative expansion. Based on this
perturbation, we find that the nature of the interactions is directly connected
to the abundance distribution, and some characteristic behaviors, such as
multiple peaks in the abundance distribution and all species coexistence at
moderate values of $u$, are discovered in a wide class of the distribution of
the interactions. The all species coexistence collapses at a critical value of
$u$, $u_c$, and this collapsing is regarded as a phase transition. To get more
quantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory on random
graphs based on techniques of statistical mechanics. The result shows those
characteristic behaviors are sustained well even for not large $u$. For even
smaller values of $u$, extinct species start to appear and the abundance
distribution becomes rounded and closer to a standard functional form. Another
interesting finding is the non-monotonic behavior of diversity, which
quantifies the number of coexisting species, when changing the ratio of
mutualistic relations $\Delta$. These results are examined by numerical
simulations, and the multiple peaks in the abundance distribution are confirmed
to be robust against a certain level of modifications of the problem. The
numerical results also show that our theory is exact for the case without
extinct species, but becomes less and less precise as the proportion of extinct
species grows.

the Sun Temple in Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, an ancient complex
prominently located atop a mesa, constructed by the ancestral Pueblo peoples
approximately 800 years ago. While the D-shaped structure is generally
recognized by modern Pueblo peoples as a ceremonial complex, the exact uses of
the site are unknown, although the site has been shown to have key solar and
lunar alignments. In this study, we examined the potential that the site was
laid out using advanced knowledge of geometrical constructs. Using aerial
imagery in conjunction with ground measurements, we performed a survey of key
features of the site. We found apparent evidence that the ancestral Pueblo
peoples laid out the site using the Golden rectangle, Pythagorean 3:4:5
triangles, equilateral triangles, and 45 degree right triangles. The survey
also revealed that a single unit of measurement, L = 30.5+/-0.5 cm, or one
third of that, appeared to be associated with many key features of the site.
Further study is needed to determine if this unit of measurement is common to
other ancestral Pueblo sites, and also if geometric constructs are apparent at
other sites. These findings represent the first potential quantitative evidence
of knowledge of advanced geometrical constructs in a prehistoric North American
society, which is particularly remarkable given that the ancestral Pueblo
peoples had no written language or number system.

To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs from
sliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two different
aggregation methods: one takes the average for each instrument and the other
takes the instrument-wise sum followed by normalization. In addition, we
conducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect the
performance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, and
activation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters.
Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, we

methods that exploit spectral features and source separation with support

the consensus of the multi-agent system with a fixed settling time if the

Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting

persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favor them,
leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no
conscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists,
only that publication is a principle factor for career advancement. Some
normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further
publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a
shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding
understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and
computational modeling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical
power in the behavioral sciences and show that power has not improved despite
repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate
the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic
model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate
novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research
methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ""progeny"", such
that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to
start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and
increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication
slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving
the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.

model defined by Cornejo and Kuhn, which we refer to as the $BL$ variant,
processes can choose in each round either to beep or to listen. Those who beep
are unable to detect simultaneous beeps. Those who listen can only distinguish
between silence and the presence of at least one beep. Beeping models are weak
in essence and even simple tasks may become difficult or unfeasible with them.
  In this paper, we address the problem of computing how many participants
there are in a one-hop network: the {\em counting} problem. We first observe
that no algorithm can compute this number with certainty in $BL$, whether the
algorithm be deterministic or even randomised (Las Vegas). We thus consider the
stronger variant where beeping nodes are able to detect simultaneous beeps,
referred to as $B_{cd}L$ (for {\em collision detection}). We prove that at

running time is $O(n)$ rounds with high probability. Further experimental
results show that its expected running time is less than $10n$. Finally, we
discuss how this algorithm can be adapted in other beeping models. In
particular, we show that it can be emulated in $BL$, at the cost of a
logarithmic slowdown and of trading its Las Vegas nature (result certain, time
uncertain) against Monte Carlo (time certain, result uncertain).

Hlineny [JCTB 2006] that the decision problem, whether a given matroid over a

Precisely, we design an efficient routine that constructs an optimal

embedding---has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and
inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel
methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a
generalization of the original ""feature map"" common to support vector machines
(SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the
latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel
machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery,
and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of
existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the
most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research
directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and
positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by
a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions,
theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of
distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which
prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing,
independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the
Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical
insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables
us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in
graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a
non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and
other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research
directions.

reviewed. The STP extends the classical matrix product to two arbitrary
matrices. Under STP the set of matrices becomes a monoid (semi-group with
identity). Some related structures and properties are investigated. Then the
generalized matrix addition is also introduced, which extends the classical
matrix addition to a class of two matrices with different dimensions.
  Motivated by STP of matrices, two kinds of equivalences of matrices
(including vectors) are introduced, which are called matrix equivalence
(M-equivalence) and vector equivalence (V-equivalence) respectively. The
lattice structure has been established for each equivalence. Under each
equivalence, the corresponding quotient space becomes a vector space. Under
M-equivalence, many algebraic, geometric, and analytic structures have been
posed to the quotient space, which include (i) lattice structure; (ii) inner
product and norm (distance); (iii) topology; (iv) a fiber bundle structure,
called the discrete bundle; (v) bundled differential manifold; (vi) bundled Lie
group and Lie algebra. Under V-equivalence, vectors of different dimensions
form a vector space ${\cal V}$, and a matrix $A$ of arbitrary dimension is
considered as an operator (linear mapping) on ${\cal V}$. When $A$ is a bounded
operator (not necessarily square but includes square matrices as a special
case), the generalized characteristic function, eigenvalue and eigenvector etc.
are defined.
  In one word, this new matrix theory overcomes the dimensional barrier in
certain sense. It provides much more freedom for using matrix approach to
practical problems.

understood yet but multi-dimensional fluid instabilities such as standing
accretion shock instability (SASI) and convection are now believed to be
crucial for shock revival. Another multi-dimensional effect that has been
recently argued is the asymmetric structures in progenitors, which are induced
by violent convections in silicon/oxygen layers that occur before the onset of
collapse, as revealed by recent numerical simulations of the last stage of
massive star evolutions. Furthermore, it has been also demonstrated numerically
that accretions of such non-spherical envelopes could facilitate shock revival.
These two multi-dimensional may hence hold a key to successful explosions. In
this paper, we performed a linear stability analysis of the standing accretion
shock in core-collapse supernovae, taking into account non-spherical, unsteady
accretion flows onto the shock to clarify the possible links between the two
effects. We found that such pre-shock perturbations can excite the fluid
instabilities efficiently and hence help the shock revive in core-collapse
supernovae.

There is neuro-psychological evidence that actions performed by humans are
anticipated by peculiar motor acts which are discriminant of the type of action
going to be performed afterwards. In other words, an actual intent can be
forecast by looking at the kinematics of the immediately preceding movement. To
prove it in a computational and quantitative manner, we devise a new
experimental setup where, without using contextual information, we predict
human intents all originating from the same motor act. We posit the problem as
a classification task and we introduce a new multi-modal dataset consisting of
a set of motion capture marker 3D data and 2D video sequences, where, by only
analysing very similar movements in both training and test phases, we are able
to predict the underlying intent, i.e., the future, never observed action. We
also present an extensive experimental evaluation as a baseline, customizing
state-of-the-art techniques for either 3D and 2D data analysis. Realizing that
video processing methods lead to inferior performance but show complementary
information with respect to 3D data sequences, we developed a 2D+3D fusion
analysis where we achieve better classification accuracies, attesting the
superiority of the multimodal approach for the context-free prediction of human

general-purpose solvers for semidefinite programs are often too slow and memory
intensive for large-scale problems. We propose a general framework to
approximately solve large-scale semidefinite problems (SDPs) at low complexity.
Our approach, referred to as biconvex relaxation (BCR), transforms a general
SDP into a specific biconvex optimization problem, which can then be solved in
the original, low-dimensional variable space at low complexity. The resulting
biconvex problem is solved using an efficient alternating minimization (AM)
procedure. Since AM has the potential to get stuck in local minima, we propose
a general initialization scheme that enables BCR to start close to a global
optimum - this is key for our algorithm to quickly converge to optimal or
near-optimal solutions. We showcase the efficacy of our approach on three
applications in computer vision, namely segmentation, co-segmentation, and
manifold metric learning. BCR achieves solution quality comparable to
state-of-the-art SDP methods with speedups between 4X and 35X. At the same
time, BCR handles a more general set of SDPs than previous approaches, which

  Bray; J. J. Eldridge Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 2016",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1275",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a simple model to explain the velocity of young neutron stars. We
attempt to confirm a relationship between the amount of mass ejected in the
formation of the neutron star and the `kick' velocity imparted to the compact
remnant resulting from the process. We assume the velocity is given by $v_{\rm
kick}=\alpha\,(M_{\rm ejecta} / M_{\rm remnant}) + \beta\,$. To test this
simple relationship we use the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis)
code to create stellar population models from both single and binary star
evolutionary pathways. We then use our Remnant Ejecta and Progenitor Explosion
Relationship (REAPER) code to apply different $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values and
three different `kick' orientations then record the resulting velocity
probability distributions.
  We find that while a single star population provides a poor fit to the
observational data, the binary population provides an excellent fit. Values of
$\alpha=70\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ and $\beta=110\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ reproduce the
\cite{RN165} observed 2-dimensional velocities and $\alpha=70\, {\rm
km\,s^{-1}}$ and $\beta=120\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ reproduce their inferred
3-dimensional velocity distribution for nearby single neutron stars with ages
less than 3 Myrs. After testing isotropic, spin-axis aligned and orthogonal to
spin-axis `kick' orientations, we find no statistical preference for a `kick'
orientation. While ejecta mass cannot be the only factor that determines the
velocity of supernovae compact remnants, we suggest it is a significant
contributor and that the ejecta based `kick' should replace the
Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution currently used in many population
synthesis codes.

grail of ExaFLOP performance, their power consumption has to be reduced by at
least one order of magnitude. This goal can be achieved only through a
combination of hardware and software advances. Being able to model and
accurately predict the power consumption of large computational systems is
necessary for software-level innovations such as proactive and power-aware
scheduling, resource allocation and fault tolerance techniques. In this paper
we present a 2-layer model of power consumption for a hybrid supercomputer
(which held the top spot of the Green500 list on July 2013) that combines CPU,
GPU and MIC technologies to achieve higher energy efficiency. Our model takes
as input workload information - the number and location of resources that are
used by each job at a certain time - and calculates the resulting system-level
power consumption. When jobs are submitted to the system, the workload
configuration can be foreseen based on the scheduler policies, and our model
can then be applied to predict the ensuing system-level power consumption.
Additionally, alternative workload configurations can be evaluated from a power
perspective and more efficient ones can be selected. Applications of the model
include not only power-aware scheduling but also prediction of anomalous
behavior.

scenarios. For very efficient surface friction ($t_{s,fric}=$ 0.1 days), the
simulations for short rotation periods ($P_{rot} \leq$ 10 days) show
predominantly standing extra tropical Rossby waves. These waves lead to climate
states with two high latitude westerly jets and unperturbed meridional direct
circulation. In most other scenarios, simulations with short rotation periods
exhibit instead dominance by standing tropical Rossby waves. Such climate
states have a single equatorial westerly jet, which disrupts direct
circulation.
  Experiments with weak surface friction ($t_{s,fric}=~10 -100$ days) show
decoupling between surface temperatures and circulation, which leads to strong
cooling of the night side. The experiment with $t_{s,fric}= 100$ days assumes
climate states with easterly flow (retrograde rotation) for medium and slow
planetary rotations $P_{rot}= 12 - 100$~days.

based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) and designed to work at the IRAM
30 m telescope (Pico Veleta, Spain). Built on the experience of the NIKA
prototype, NIKA2 has been installed at the 30 m focal plane in October 2015 and
the commissioning phase is now ongoing. Through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(tSZ) effect, NIKA2 will image the ionized gas residing in clusters of galaxies
with a resolution of 12 and 18 arcsec FWHM (at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively).
We report on the recent tSZ measurements with the NIKA camera and discuss the
future objectives for the NIKA2 SZ large Program, 300h of observation dedicated
to SZ science. With this program we intend to perform a high angular resolution
follow-up of a cosmologically-representative sample of clusters belonging to SZ
catalogues, with redshift greater than 0.5. The main output of the program will
be the study of the redshift evolution of the cluster pressure profile as well
as that of the scaling laws relating the cluster global properties.

also study the exponential rate of decay of the remaining uncertainty to zero

consider various classes of random universal hash functions. Instead of
measuring remaining uncertainties using traditional Shannon information

other techniques, we employ new one-shot bounds and the moments of type class

the rich source of high aesthetics photos online, similar approaches can
potentially be incorporated in future smart cameras to enhance a person's photo

facets and rep- resents a lively and challenging research field. It is
interconnected to the peculiar role of strangeness, since the strange quark is
rather light, but still much heavier than the up and down quarks. Thus, when
strangeness is involved one has to deal with spontaneous and explicit symmetry
breaking in QCD. It is well known that the antikaon interaction with nucleons
is attractive, but how strong ? Is the interaction strong enough to bind
nucleons to form kaonic nuclei and, if so, what are the properties (binding
energy, decay width)? There are controversial indications for such bound states
and new results are expected to come soon. The existence of antikaon mediated
bound states might have important consequences since it would open the
possibility for the formation of cold baryonic matter of high density which
might have a severe impact in astrophysics for the understanding of the
composi- tion of compact (neutron) stars. New experimental opportunities could
be provided by the AMADEUS experiment at the DA?NE electron-positron collider
at LNF-INFN (Frascati, Italy). Pre-AMADEUS studies on the antikaon interaction
with nuclei are carried out by analysis of data collected by KLOE in till 2005
and in special data runs using a carbon target insert. Studies for the
dedicated AMADEUS detector setup taking advantage of the low-energy antikaons
from Phi-meson decay delivered by DAFNE are in progress. Some re- sults

visco-elastic bodies, also subject to inertia, which can be interpreted as a
model for dynamic fracture. The rate-independent flow rule for the delamination
parameter is coupled with the momentum balance for the displacement, including
inertia. This model features a nonsmooth constraint ensuring the continuity of
the displacements outside the crack set, which is marked by the support of the
delamination parameter. A weak solvability concept, generalizing the notion of
energetic solution for rate-independent systems to the present mixed
rate-dependent/rate-independent frame, is proposed. Via refined variational
convergence techniques, existence of solutions is proved by passing to the
limit in approximating systems which regularize the nonsmooth constraint by
conditions for adhesive contact. The presence of the inertial term requires the
design of suitable recovery spaces small enough to provide compactness but
large enough to recover the information on the crack set in the limit.

at milliarcsecond-scale, as observed using the VLBA at $\lambda=7$mm and
$\lambda=3$mm. An earlier paper considered overall maser morphology and
constraints on SiO maser excitation and pumping derived from these data. The
goal of the current paper is to use the measured polarization properties of
individual co-spatial components detected across multiple transitions to
provide constraints on several competing theories for the transport of
polarized maser emission. This approach minimizes the significant effects of
spatial blending. We present several diagnostic tests designed to distinguish
key features of competing theoretical models for maser polarization. The number
of coincident features is limited by sensitivity however, particularly in the
v=1 J=2-1 transition at 86 GHz, and deeper observations are needed. Preliminary
conclusions based on the current data provide some support for: i)
spin-independent solutions for linear polarization; ii) the influence of
geometry on the distribution of fractional linear polarization with intensity;
and, iii) $\pi/2$ rotations in linear polarization position angle arising from
transitions across the Van Vleck angle ($\sin^2{\theta}=2/3$) between the maser
line-of-sight and magnetic field. There is weaker evidence for several
enumerated non-Zeeman explanations for circular polarization. The expected 2:1
ratio in circular polarization between J=1-0 and J=2-1 predicted by standard
Zeeman theory cannot unfortunately be tested conclusively due to insufficient
coincident components.

the null cone of a neutral metric, a point of view we call neutral causal
topology. In particular, we construct and investigate neutral 4-manifolds with
null boundaries that arise from canonical 3- and 4-dimensional settings.
  A null hypersurface is foliated by its normal and, in the neutral case,
inherits a pair of totally null planes at each point. This paper focuses on
these plane bundles in a number of classical settings
  The first construction is the conformal compactification of flat neutral
4-space into the 4-ball. The null foliation on the boundary in this case is the
Hopf fibration on the 3-sphere and the totally null planes in the boundary are
integrable. The metric on the 4-ball is a conformally flat, scalar-flat,
positive Ricci curvature neutral metric.
  The second constructions are subsets of the 4-dimensional space of oriented
geodesics in a 3-dimensional space-form, equipped with its canonical neutral
metric. We consider all oriented geodesics tangent to a given embedded strictly
convex 2-sphere.
  The third is a neutral geometric model for the intersection of two surfaces
in a 4-manifold. The surfaces are the sets of oriented normal lines to two
round spheres in Euclidean 3-space, which form Lagrangian surfaces in the
4-dimensional space of all oriented lines. The intersection of the boundaries
of their normal neighbourhoods form tori that we prove are totally real and
Lorentz if the spheres do not intersect.

and pattern recognition. Facial analysis can be viewed as a two-fold problem,
namely (i) facial representation, and (ii) classification. So far, many face
representations have been proposed, a well-known method is the Local Binary
Pattern (LBP), which has witnessed a growing interest. In this respect, we
treat in this paper the issues of face representation as well as classification
in a novel manner. On the one hand, we use a variant to LBP, so-called Complete
Local Binary Pattern (CLBP), which differs from the basic LBP by coding a given
local region using a given central pixel and Sing_ Magnitude difference.
Subsequently, most of LBPbased descriptors use a fixed grid to code a given
facial image, which technique is, in most cases, not robust to pose variation
and misalignment. To cope with such issue, a representative Multi-Resolution
Histogram (MH) decomposition is adopted in our work. On the other hand, having
the histograms of the considered images extracted, we exploit their sparsity to
construct a so-called Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) for further face
classification. Experimental results have been conducted on ORL face database,
and pointed out the superiority of our scheme over other popular
state-of-the-art techniques.

investigate the correlation of the different galaxy stellar components with the
mass of the central SMBH. The stellar mass in the disc, in the bulge, and in
the pseudo-bulge of galaxies is related to quiescent star formation, to galaxy
interactions, and to the loss of angular momentum following disc instabilities,
respectively. Consistently with recent findings, we find that while the
predicted bulge masses are tightly correlated with the SMBH masses, the
correlation between the latter and the galactic discs shows a much larger
scatter, in particular when bulgeless galaxies are considered. In addition, we
obtain that the predicted masses of pseudo-bulges shows little or

the global equivalent current, calculated using more than 30 years of SuperMAG
magnetometer data, changes with sunlight conditions. The calculations are done
using spherical harmonic analysis in quasi-dipole coordinates, a technique
which leads to improved accuracy compared to previous studies. Sorting the data
according to the location of the sunlight terminator and orientation of the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we find that the equivalent current
resembles ionospheric convection patterns on the sunlit side of the terminator
but not on the dark side. On the dark side, with southward IMF, the current is
strongly dominated by a dawn cell and the current across the polar cap has a
strong dawnward component. The contrast between the sunlit and dark side
increases with increasing values of the $\mathit{F}_{10.7}$ index, showing that
increasing solar EUV flux changes not only the magnitude but also the
morphology of the equivalent current system. The results are consistent with a
recent study showing that Birkeland currents indirectly determine the
equivalent current in darkness and that Hall currents dominate in sunlight.
This has implication for the interpretation of ground magnetic field
measurements and suggests that the magnetic disturbances at conjugate points
will be asymmetrical when the solar illumination is different.

different types of component codes, the proposed method enables the

multiple-burst-error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in

$x > 1$ given perturbed samples from an equally spaced grid on $[-1,1]$.
Mathematical folklore states that extrapolation is in general hopelessly
ill-conditioned, but we show that a more precise statement carries an
interesting nuance. For a function $f$ on $[-1,1]$ that is analytic in a
Bernstein ellipse with parameter $\rho > 1$, and for a uniform perturbation
level $\epsilon$ on the function samples, we construct an asymptotically best
extrapolant $e(x)$ as a least squares polynomial approximant of degree $M^*$
given explicitly. We show that the extrapolant $e(x)$ converges to $f(x)$
pointwise in the interval $I_\rho\in[1,(\rho+\rho^{-1})/2)$ as $\epsilon \to
0$, at a rate given by a $x$-dependent fractional power of $\epsilon$. More
precisely, for each $x \in I_{\rho}$ we have
  \[
  |f(x) - e(x)| = \mathcal{O}\left( \epsilon^{-\log r(x) / \log\rho} \right),
\qquad\qquad r(x) = \frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-1}}{\rho},
  \] up to log factors, provided that the oversampling conditioning is
satisfied. That is,
  \[
  M^* \leq \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{N},
  \] which is known to be needed from approximation theory. In short,
extrapolation enjoys a weak form of stability, up to a fraction of the
characteristic smoothness length. The number of function samples, $N+1$, does
not bear on the size of the extrapolation error provided that it obeys the
oversampling condition. We also show that one cannot construct an
asymptotically more accurate extrapolant from $N+1$ equally spaced samples than
$e(x)$, using any other linear or nonlinear procedure. The proofs involve
original statements on the stability of polynomial approximation in the
Chebyshev basis from equally spaced samples and these are expected to be of
independent interest.

observed during very similar seasonal and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)

the signatures differed considerably in their local time extent. The two
periods are 26 August 1998, when the IMF had components
$\mathit{B}_{\mathit{z}}$ $\approx$ -10 nT and $\mathit{B}_{\mathit{y}}$
$\approx$ 9 nT and the solar wind speed was $\mathit{V}_{\mathit{x}}$ $\approx$

Eu-clidian space using scalar, vector, and tensor-valued quantities usually up

transform the relations into a matrix-vector format. This transformation is
usually performed using the so-called Voigt mapping. This mapping does not
preserve tensor character leaving significant room for error as stress and
strain quantities follow from different mappings and thus have to be treated
differently in certain mathematical operations. Despite its conceptual and
notational difficulties having been pointed out, the Voigt mapping remains the
foundation of most current finite element programmes. An alternative is the
so-called Kelvin mapping which has recently gained recognition in studies of
theoretical mechanics. This article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin
mapping in numerical modelling tools such as finite element software. The
decisive difference to the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin's method preserves
tensor character, and thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds
to the original tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations
are that tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress
or strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed into
matrix equations without additional considerations. The only implementational
changes are related to a scalar factor in certain finite element matrices and
hence, harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very little cost.

the magnetospheric plasma population. Measuring cold ions is difficult though.
Observations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in
regions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar
illumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle
detectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow
during segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise if continuous
longtime observations, such as during a geomagnetic storm, are needed. In this
paper we suggest a new approach, based on a combination of synoptic
observations and a novel technique to estimate the flux and total outflow
during the various phases of geomagnetic storms. Our results indicate large
variations in both outflow rates and transport throughout the storm. Prior to
the storm main phase, outflow rates are moderate, and the cold ions are mainly
emanating from moderately sized polar cap regions. Throughout the main phase of
the storm, outflow rates increase and the polar cap source regions expand.
Furthermore, faster transport, resulting from enhanced convection, leads to a
much larger supply of cold ions to the near-Earth region during geomagnetic
storms.

functional that restricts the problem in the superconductor volume. We show the
magnetization process of a thin film and a 3D bulk sample. We compare our model
of the thin film geometry with the thin film formula, reaching a good
agreement. We also compare a striated tape, where the filaments are connected

and an anisotropic E(J) relation. For the latter, E is not parallel to J when
the magnetic flux density is not perpendicular to J (force free situation). The
last studied situation is the 3D cubic sample. We find the time dependence of
the current density and AC loss for each situation. In the cubic bulk sample,
we found a non-negligible component of the current density in the direction of
the applied field. The presented numerical method is very promising for 3D

using Liquid xenOn (PETALO). The detector is based in the Liquid Xenon
Scintillating Cell (LXSC). The cell is a box filled with liquid xenon (LXe)
whose transverse dimensions are chosen to optimize packing and with a thickness
optimized to contain a large fraction of the incoming photons. The entry and
exit faces of the box (relative to the incoming gammas direction) are
instrumented with large silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), coated with a
wavelength shifter, tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). The non-instrumented faces are
covered by reflecting Teflon coated with TPB. In this thesis we show that the
LXSC can display an energy resolution of 5% FWHM, much better than that of
conventional solid scintillators such as LSO/LYSO. The LXSC can measure the
interaction point of the incoming photon with a resolution in the three
coordinates of 1 mm. The very fast scintillation time of LXe (2 ns) and the
availability of suitable sensors and electronics permits a coincidence
resolution time (CRT) in the range of 100-200 ps, again much better than any
current PET-TOF system. The LXSC constitutes the core of a high-sensitivity,
nuclear magnetic resonance compatible, PET device, with enhanced Time Of Flight
(TOF) sensitivity.

Full-Duplex (FD) MAC protocols to scale the FD capacity gain (i.e. 2x the
half-duplex throughput) in single-cell Wi-Fi networks. Under such guideline
(referred to as 1:1), a MAC protocol attempts to initiate up to two
simultaneous transmissions in the FD bandwidth. Since in single-cell Wi-Fi
networks MAC performance is bounded by the PHY layer capacity, this implies
gains strictly less than 2x over half-duplex at the MAC layer. To face this
limitation, we argue for the 1:N design guideline. Under 1:N, FD MAC protocols
'see' the FD bandwidth through N>1 orthogonal narrow-channel PHY layers. Based
on theoretical results and software defined radio experiments, we show the 1:N
design can leverage the Wi-Fi capacity gain more than 2x at and below the MAC
layer. This translates the denser modulation scheme incurred by channel
narrowing and the increase in the spatial reuse offer enabled by channel
orthogonality. With these results, we believe our design guideline can inspire
a new generation of Wi-Fi MAC protocols that fully embody and scale the FD
capacity gain.

possibilities of the observer to perturb the group are limited and empirical
observations must rely on rare natural perturbations. An alternative way is to
use spatio-temporal correlations to assess the information transfer mechanism

information transfer mechanisms: the classic Vicsek model, describing an
overdamped noninertial dynamics and the inertial spin model, characterized by

turns out that, in the case in which one considers the cyclic permutation $(1\

give a combinatorial interpretation of these permutations in terms of
lexicographic order of the vertices of the tree. This allows us to describe
their fixed points. We show that our permutation matrices can be used to let
the Kronecker product of matrices commute or, more generally, rearrange in an
arbitrary order. Moreover, we show that the group generated by such
permutations does depend only on the branch indices of the tree, but it is
independent from their order. In the case in which such indices coincide, we
prove that the corresponding group is a copy of $Sym(m)$ inside $Sym(n^m)$.

deals with the observation of Brillouin scattering in nanoscale silicon
waveguides. The waveguides tightly confine $193 \, \text{THz}$ light and $10 \,
\text{GHz}$ acoustic vibrations. The acoustic quality factor remains limited to
about $300$ because of leakage into silica substrate. These waveguides are
optically transparent in a narrow band of frequencies at a pump power of $25 \,

work of chapter 4 by fabricating a cascade of fully suspended nanowires held by
silica anchors. This enhances the mechanical quality factor from $300$ to
$1000$, enabling the observation of Brillouin amplification exceeding the
propagation losses in silicon. The amount of amplification is mostly limited by
a rapid drop in acoustic quality as the number of suspensions increases. We
propose a mechanism to cancel this inhomogeneous broadening. Chapter 6 looks at
the potential of narrow silicon slot waveguides to enhance the optomechanical
coupling. For certain dimensions, these waveguides support opto-acoustic modes

thermalization algorithm to two-color quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two

gauge configurations that had been generated using a renormalization group (RG)
matched coarse action, thereby producing a fine ensemble that is close to the
thermalized distribution of a target fine action; the refined ensemble is
subsequently rethermalized using conventional algorithms. Although the
generalization of this algorithm from pure Yang-Mills theory to QCD with
dynamical fermions is straightforward, we find that in the latter case, the
method is susceptible to numerical instabilities during the initial stages of
rethermalization when using the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find that
these instabilities arise from large fermion forces in the evolution, which are
attributed to an accumulation of spurious near-zero modes of the Dirac
operator. We propose a simple strategy for curing this problem, and demonstrate
that rapid thermalization--as probed by a variety of gluonic and fermionic
operators--is possible with the use of this solution. In addition, we study the
sensitivity of rethermalization rates to the RG matching of the coarse and fine
actions, and identify effective matching conditions based on a variety of

matter, are promising for achieving the low-power-consuming electronic devices
owning to the remarkable robustness of their conducting edge states against
backscattering. Currently, the major challenge to further studies and possible
applications is the lack of suitable materials, which should be with high
feasibility of fabrication and sizeable nontrivial gaps. Here, we demonstrate
through first-principles calculations that SiTe 2D crystal is a promising 2D TI
with a sizeable nontrivial gap of 0.220 eV. This material is dynamically and
thermally stable. Most importantly, it could be easily exfoliated from its
three-dimensional superlattice due to the weakly bonded layered structure.
Moreover, strain engineering can effectively control its nontrivial gap and
even induce a topological phase transition. Our results provide a realistic
candidate for experimental explorations and potential applications of 2D TIs.

offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the
model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the
solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV)
enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions
from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth
convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and
a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such
as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the
functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to
high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to
minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but
reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the
convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing
technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which
automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The
generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally
desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the
duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to
adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a
convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient
smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional
structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many
state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision.

platforms, the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the

location-based request to workers according to their positions, and workers
need to physically move to specified locations to conduct tasks. Many works
have studied task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing, however, their
problem settings are different from each other. Thus, it is hard to compare the
performances of existing algorithms on task assignment in spatial
crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental
comparison of most existing algorithms on task assignment in spatial
crowdsourcing. Specifically, we first give general definitions about spatial
workers and spatial tasks based on definitions in the existing works such that
the existing algorithms can be applied on the same synthetic and real data
sets. Then, we provide an uniform implementation for all the tested algorithms
of task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing (open sourced). Finally,
based on the results on both synthetic and real data sets, we discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of tested algorithms, which can guide future research
on the same area and practical implementations of spatial crowdsourcing
systems.

We find distinct kinematic trends in the metal rich ($\mathrm{[M/H]}>0$) and
metal poor ($\mathrm{[M/H]}<0$) stars in the data. The velocity dispersion of
the metal-rich stars drops steeply with latitude, compared to a flat profile in
the metal-poor stars, as has been seen previously. We argue that the metal-rich
stars in this region are mostly on orbits that support the boxy-peanut shape of
the bulge, which naturally explains the drop in their velocity dispersion
profile with latitude. The metal rich stars also exhibit peaky features in
their line-of-sight velocity histograms, particularly along the minor axis of
the bulge. We propose that these features are due to stars on resonant orbits
supporting the boxy-peanut bulge. This conjecture is strengthened through the
comparison of the minor axis data with the velocity histograms of resonant
orbits generated in simulations of buckled bars. The 'banana' or 2:1:2 orbits
provide strongly bimodal histograms with narrow velocity peaks that resemble
the Gaia-ESO metal-rich data.

spectral singularities in PT-symmetric optical systems is the discovery of
CPA-lasers. These are devices that act both as a threshold laser and a coherent
perfect absorber (CPA) for the same values of their physical parameters. Unlike
a homogeneous slab that is made to act as a CPA, a slab CPA-laser would absorb
the incident waves coming from the left and right of the device provided that
they have appropriate intensity and phase contrasts. We provide a comprehensive
study of one of the simplest experimentally accessible examples of a CPA-laser,
namely a PT-symmetric optical slab system consisting of a balanced pair of
adjacent or separated gain and loss components. In particular, we give a closed
form expression describing the spectral singularities of the system which
correspond to its CPA-laser configurations. We determine the intensity and
phase contrasts for the TE and TM waves that are emitted (absorbed) whenever
the slab acts as a laser (CPA). We also investigate the behavior of the
time-averaged energy density and Poynting vector for these waves. This is
necessary for determining the optimal values of the physical parameters of the
system that make it act as a CPA-laser. These turn out to correspond to
situations where the separation distance $s$ between the gain and loss layers
is an odd multiple of a characteristic length scale $s_0$. A curious by-product
of our study is that, except for the cases where $s$ is an even integer
multiple of $s_0$, there is a critical angle of polarization beyond which the
energy of the waves emitted from the lossy layer can be larger than the energy
of those emitted from the gain layer.

Kalman filter based on the modified Cholesky decomposition. The proposed
implementation starts with decomposing the domain into sub-domains. In each
sub-domain a sparse estimation of the inverse background error covariance
matrix is computed via a modified Cholesky decomposition; the estimates are
computed concurrently on separate processors. The sparsity of this estimator is
dictated by the conditional independence of model components for some radius of
influence. Then, the assimilation step is carried out in parallel without the
need of inter-processor communication. Once the local analysis states are
computed, the analysis sub-domains are mapped back onto the global domain to
obtain the analysis ensemble. Computational experiments are performed using the
Atmospheric General Circulation Model (SPEEDY) with the T-63 resolution on the
Blueridge cluster at Virginia Tech. The number of processors used in the
experiments ranges from 96 to 2,048. The proposed implementation outperforms in
terms of accuracy the well-known local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF)
for all the model variables. The computational time of the proposed
implementation is similar to that of the parallel LETKF method (where no
covariance estimation is performed). Finally, for the largest number of
processors, the proposed parallel implementation is 400 times faster than the
serial version of the proposed method.

thin film of gold ending in a conducting nano-junction serve as samples to
investigate the transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum.
These structures were specifically designed as samples where an incident beam
of light is retroreflected. Since in the process of retroreflection the turning
sense of a circularly polarized beam of light does not change and the direction
of propagation is inverted, the photon spin is inverted. Due to conservation of
angular momentum a transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum
of conduction electrons occurs. In the structures a circular movement of
electrons is blocked and therefore the transfered spin can be detected as a
photovoltage due to an electromotive force which is induced by the transfer of
angular momentum. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, a maximum
photovoltage of about 0,2 micro V was measured for both structures. The results
are interpreted in terms of a classical electrodynamic model of the
monochromatic linearly polarized photon as a propagating solitary
electromagnetic wave of finite energy hf which carries an angular momentum
h/2pi which is elaborated elsewhere where h is Plancks constant and f the
frequency of light. The relative values of the measured photovoltages for
different polarizations can well be explained by the electrodynamic model of a
photon and an associated spin angular momentum. The absolute values of the
measured photovoltages are also consistent with the interpretation. The
observed effects are closely related to the lateral Fedorov Imbert shift of
focused beams in optics and the optical spin Hall effect and to other non
linear optical effects such as the inverse faraday effect for which a new
interpretation is given here in terms of the electrodynamic model of the photon
and its spin.
