researchers because of their effectiveness at preserving past inputs for
time-varying data processing tasks. To understand the success and limitations
of RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamental
memory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs with
simple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, the
short-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network size
must scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The main
contribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STM
capacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputs
have common low-dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significant
statistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the number
of nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate and
poly-logarithmically with the ambient input dimension. The analysis relies on
advanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicit
non-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysis
provides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM properties
in RNNs.

occur. In this paper an alternative proof of binding in case of off-diagonal

off-diagonal, the ground state energy of the spin-boson model is an eigenvalue

non-unitary triplet pairing state. However all the allowed non-unitary triplet
states have nodal gap functions but most thermodynamic and NMR measurements
indicate fully gapped superconductivity in LaNiC$_2$. Here we probe the gap
symmetry of LaNiGa$_2$ by measuring the London penetration depth, specific heat

superconductivity in LaNiGa$_2$, suggesting that this is a common feature of
both compounds. These results allow us to propose a novel triplet
superconducting state, where the pairing occurs between electrons of the same
spin, but on different orbitals. In this case the superconducting wavefunction
has a triplet spin component but isotropic even parity gap symmetry, yet the
overall wavefunction remains antisymmetric under particle exchange. This model
leads to a nodeless two-gap superconducting state which breaks time reversal
symmetry, and therefore accounts well for the seemingly contradictory
experimental results.

weighting the contribution of each pair. This allows for recognition over
arbitrary camera trajectories, without requiring explicit training over the

pairwise relationships then naturally extends to the next-best-view problem in
an active recognition framework. To achieve this, we train a second

g-band image, obtained as part of the MATLAS large programme at the CFHT, with
Planck radiance and Wise 12 micron data. The combination of these three

is well described by a single power law over scales ranging from 0.01 to 50 pc.
The exponent of the power spectrum, gamma=-2.9 +- 0.1, is compatible with what
is expected for thermally bi-stable and turbulent HI. We did not find any
steepening of the power spectrum at small scales indicating that the typical
scale at which turbulent energy is dissipated in this medium is smaller than
0.01pc. The ambipolar diffusion scenario that is usually proposed as the main
dissipative agent, is consistent with our data only if the density of the cloud
observed is higher than the typical values assumed for the cold neutral medium
gas. We discuss the new avenue offered by deep optical imaging surveys for the
study of the low density ISM structure and turbulence.

molecular electronic devices. With just a few systems investigated as a
function of bias and temperature so far, thermal effects in molecular tunnel
junctions remain poorly understood. Here we report a detailed charge transport
study of an individual redox-active ferrocene-based molecule over a wide range
of temperatures and applied potentials. The results show the temperature
dependence of the current to vary strongly as a function of the gate voltage.
Specifically, the current across the molecule exponentially increases in the
Coulomb blockade regime and decreases at the charge degeneracy points, while
remaining temperature-independent at resonance. Our observations can be well
accounted for by a formal single-level tunneling model where the temperature
dependence relies on the thermal broadening of the Fermi distributions of the
electrons in the leads.

an alternative method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using
sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$ optimization to select a subset of nonlinear
interactions representing dynamics on a fully connected network. Our method
generalizes the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm
to dynamical systems with rational function nonlinearities, such as biological
networks. We show that dynamical systems with rational nonlinearities may be
cast in an implicit form, where the equations may be identified in the
null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities including the state and
derivative terms; this approach applies more generally to implicit dynamical
systems beyond those containing rational nonlinearities. This method,
implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models:
Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, the regulatory network for competence in
bacteria, and the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.

few entries from it, is a widely studied problem in both theory and practice
with wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problem
have been restricted to the offline setting where they provide an estimate of
the unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However, in many
applications, the online version, where we observe one entry at a time and
dynamically update our estimate, is more appealing. While existing algorithms
are efficient for the offline setting, they could be highly inefficient for the
online setting.
  In this paper, we propose the first provable, efficient online algorithm for
matrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrix
and then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After every
observation, it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tall
matrices, giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally used
in the offline setting as well, where it gives competitive sample complexity
and runtime to state of the art algorithms. Our proofs introduce a general
framework to show that SGD updates tend to stay away from saddle surfaces and
could be of broader interests for other non-convex problems to prove tight
rates.

environment. Measuring these traction forces requires a workflow combining cell
experiments, image processing and force reconstruction based on elasticity
theory. Such procedures have been established before mainly for planar
substrates, in which case one can use the Green's function formalism. Here we
introduce a worksflow to measure traction forces of cardiac myofibroblasts on
non-planar elastic substrates. Soft elastic substrates with a wave-like
topology were micromolded from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and fluorescent
marker beads were distributed homogeneously in the substrate. Using feature
vector based tracking of these marker beads, we first constructed a hexahedral
mesh for the substrate. We then solved the direct elastic boundary volume
problem on this mesh using the finite element method (FEM). Using data
simulations, we show that the traction forces can be reconstructed from the
substrate deformations by solving the corresponding inverse problem with a
L1-norm for the residue and a L2-norm for 0th order Tikhonov regularization.
Applying this procedure to the experimental data, we find that cardiac
myofibroblast cells tend to align both their shapes and their forces with the
long axis of the deformable wavy substrate.

in the second-stage with absolute semi-deviation (ASD) risk measure.
Traditional stochastic programming models are risk-neutral where expected costs
are considered for the second-stage. A common approach to address risk is to
include a dispersion statistic in addition with expected costs and weighted
appropriately. Due to the lack of block angular structure, stochastic programs
with ASD risk-measure possess computational challenges. The proposed
decomposition algorithm uses another risk-measure `expected excess', and
provides tighter bounds for ASD stochastic models. We perform computational
study on a supply chain replenishment problem and standard knapsack instances.
The computational results using supply chain instances demonstrate the
usefulness of ASD risk-measure in decision making under uncertainty, and
knapsack instances indicate that the proposed methodology outperforms a direct
solver.

an adaptive term to the source domain classifier. The adaptive function is a
linear function based a domain transfer multi-instance dictionary. Given a

classification error of the target domain classifier over the target domain
training set, and the complexities of both the adaptive function parameter and

each desired symmetry group $G$ one looks at mapping $BG$ into that. This
classifies equivalence classes of G-extended fusion categories. This is an
equivalence at a fully extended level so will allow many defects rather than
only evaluating partition functions on closed manifolds. We can now use these
categories to build a new fully extended 3d topological field theory, but now
possibly with extra data. This is the result of permeating defect walls and
saying how that affects the assignment to the point strata.

the function is constrained to have discrete total variation bounded by $C_n$,
we derive the minimax optimal (squared) $\ell_2$ estimation error rate,
parametrized by $n$ and $C_n$. Total variation denoising, also known as the
fused lasso, is seen to be rate optimal. Several simpler estimators exist, such
as Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps. A natural question is: can
these simpler estimators perform just as well? We prove that these estimators,
and more broadly all estimators given by linear transformations of the input
data, are suboptimal over the class of functions with bounded variation. This
extends fundamental findings of Donoho and Johnstone [1998] on 1-dimensional
total variation spaces to higher dimensions. The implication is that the
computationally simpler methods cannot be used for such sophisticated denoising
tasks, without sacrificing statistical accuracy. We also derive minimax rates
for discrete Sobolev spaces over $d$-dimensional grids, which are, in some
sense, smaller than the total variation function spaces. Indeed, these are
small enough spaces that linear estimators can be optimal---and a few
well-known ones are, such as Laplacian smoothing and Laplacian eigenmaps, as we
show. Lastly, we investigate the problem of adaptivity of the total variation
denoiser to these smaller Sobolev function spaces.

differing opinions in a distributed network: each vertex at each step takes on
the opinion of a random neighbour. This method, however, suffers from two
drawbacks. Even if there are only two opposing opinions, the time taken for a
single opinion to emerge can be slow and the final opinion is not necessarily
the initially held majority.
  We refer to a protocol where 2 neighbours are contacted at each step as a
2-sample voting protocol. In the two-sample protocol a vertex updates its
opinion only if both sampled opinions are the same. Not much was known about
the performance of two-sample voting on general expanders in the case of three
or more opinions. In this paper we show that the following performance can be
achieved on a $d$-regular expander using two-sample voting. We suppose there
are $k \ge 3$ opinions, and that the initial size of the largest and second
largest opinions is $A_1, A_2$ respectively.
  We prove that, if $A_1 - A_2 \ge C n \max\{\sqrt{(\log n)/A_1}, \lambda\}$,
where $\lambda$ is the absolute second eigenvalue of matrix $P=Adj(G)/d$ and
$C$ is a suitable constant, then the largest opinion wins in $O((n \log
n)/A_1)$ steps with high probability.
  For almost all $d$-regular graphs, we have $\lambda=c/\sqrt{d}$ for some
constant $c>0$. This means that as $d$ increases we can separate an opinion
whose majority is $o(n)$, whereas $\Theta(n)$ majority is required for $d$
constant.

disjoining pressure in the liquid films between separating bubbles, is shown
here to introduce jamming and stick-slip flow in a straight channel. We report
on the behaviour of these new regimes by varying the strength of the attractive
potential. It is seen that there is a force threshold below which the flow
jams, and on increasing the driving force, a cross over from intermittent
(stick-slip) to smooth flow is observed. This threshold force below which the
foam jams increases linearly with the strength of the attractive potential. By
examining the spectra of energy fluctuations, we show that stick-slip flow is
characterized by low frequency rearrangements and strongly local behaviour,
whereas steady flow shows a broad spectrum of energy drop events and collective
behaviour. Our work suggests that the stick-slip and the jamming regimes occur
due to the increased stabilization of contact networks by the attractive
potential - as the strength of attraction is increased, bubbles are
increasingly trapped within networks, and there is a decrease in the number of
contact changes.

biochemical reactions can be modeled as a master equation whose rate constants
break detailed balance. We find that non equilibrium fluxes can support
topologically protected boundary modes that resemble similar modes in
electronic and mechanical systems. We show that when a biochemical network can
be decomposed into two ordered bulks that meet at a possibly disordered
interferace, the ordered bulks can be each associated with a topologically
invariant winding number. If the winding numbers are mismatched, we are

not been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis
suggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in
social networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity
(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes and
behaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of network
evolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence
propagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.
Our experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the
important role that social influence can play in the process of network
evolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different
genres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the
network dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our
understanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge
of the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.

  Symposium on Circuits and Systems",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry heavily reuses third party IP
cores. These IP cores are vulnerable to insertion of Hardware Trojans (HTs) at
design time by third party IP core providers or by malicious insiders in the
design team. State of the art research has shown that existing HT detection
techniques, which claim to detect all publicly available HT benchmarks, can
still be defeated by carefully designing new sophisticated HTs. The reason
being that these techniques consider the HT landscape to be limited only to the
publicly known HT benchmarks, or other similar (simple) HTs. However the
adversary is not limited to these HTs and may devise new HT design principles
to bypass these countermeasures.
  In this paper, we discover certain crucial properties of HTs which lead to
the definition of an exponentially large class of Deterministic Hardware
Trojans $H_D$ that an adversary can (but is not limited to) design. The
discovered properties serve as HT design principles, based on which we design a
new HT called 'XOR-LFSR' and present it as a 'proof-of-concept' example from
the class $H_D$. These design principles help us understand the tremendous ways
an adversary has to design a HT, and show that the existing publicly known HT
benchmarks are just the tip of the iceberg on this huge landscape. This work,
therefore, stresses that instead of guaranteeing a certain (low) false negative
rate for a small constant set of publicly known HTs, a rigorous HT detection
tool should take into account these newly discovered HT design principles and
hence guarantee the detection of an exponentially large class (exponential in
number of wires in IP core) of HTs with negligible false negative rate.

a point where a sleeping frog is residing, the sleeping frog becomes active and
begins performing Brownian motion with leftward drift $\lambda$, independently
of the motion of all of the other active frogs. This paper establishes sharp
conditions on the intensity function $f$ that determine whether the model is
transient (meaning the probability that infinitely many frogs return to the
origin is 0), or non-transient (meaning this probability is greater than 0). A
discrete model with $\text{Poiss}(f(n))$ sleeping frogs at positive integer

Kl\""umper and Zittartz then generalized the AKLT Hamiltonian to one family

the deformation of other types of AKLT states with triplet-bond constructions
on the same lattice. However, we do not find such an XY-like phase in the
deformed AKLT models on other trivalent lattices, such as square-octagon, cross

remain in the same phase as the isotropic AKLT state throughout the whole

triplet VBS phase is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic phases (for large and
small deformation parameters, respectively), which are characterized by
spontaneous magnetizations along different axes. Along the way, we also discuss

upon the internal properties of the neutron star. In neutron stars, the most
important physical properties of the fluid core are the viscosity of the fluid,
the stratification of flow in the equilibrium state and the adiabatic sound
speed. Such models were previously studied by van Eysden and Melatos [73] and

the flow of fluid during this phase following more relaxed assumptions on the
stratification of flow and the pressure-density gradients within the neutron

their dependence on the physical properties of the fluid core. We find that it
is possible for the neutron star to emit gravitational wave signals in a wide

distribution. WDM clusters analysed in this work are more homogeneous than CDM
ones, and the fractional decrease in the amount of material in haloes is
proportional to the average increase in the magnification. This difference
arises from matter that would be bound in compact haloes in CDM being smoothly
distributed over much larger volumes at lower densities in WDM. Moreover, the
signature does not solely lie in the probability distribution function but in
the full spatial distribution of the convergence field.

polarisability of graphene induces a force, that can be described by an image

to overcome thermal effects when the molecule is close to the layer, even at

powerful jet formation is intrinsically rare, or that the conditions in
galactic nuclei are typically unfavorable for producing a detectable signal.
Here we explore the latter possibility by constraining the radial profile of
the gas density encountered by a TDE jet using a one-dimensional model for the
circumnuclear medium which includes mass and energy input from a stellar
population. Near the jet Sedov radius of 10$^{18}$ cm, we find gas densities in
the range of $n_{18} \sim$ 0.1$-$1000 cm$^{-3}$ across a wide range of
plausible star formation histories. Using one- and two-dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamical simulations, we calculate the synchrotron radio light curves of
TDE jets (as viewed both on and off-axis) across the allowed range of density
profiles. We find that bright radio emission would be produced across the
plausible range of nuclear gas densities by jets as powerful as Swift J1644+57,
and we quantify the relationship between the radio luminosity and jet energy.
We use existing radio detections and upper limits to constrain the energy
distribution of TDE jets. Radio follow up observations several months to
several years after the TDE candidate will strongly constrain the energetics of

that describe the IMF over the entire stellar mass range. This is achieved by
comparing the fractions of single and lonely massive O stars in a recent
catalog of the Milky Way clusters with a library of simulated clusters built

clusters are corrected for the effects of the binary population, stellar
evolution, sample incompleteness, and ejected O stars. Our findings indicate
that broad distributions of the IMF parameters are required in order to
reproduce the fractions of single and lonely O stars in Galactic clusters. They
also do not lend support to the existence of a cluster mass-maximum stellar

effects on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at linear order, they do
spatially modulate two-point CMB statistics and can be reconstructed in a
manner similar to gravitational lensing. Due to the similarity between the
effects of CMB lensing and CIPs, lensing contributes nearly Gaussian random
noise to the CIP estimator that approximately doubles the reconstruction noise
power. Additionally, the cross correlation between lensing and the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect generates a correlation between the CIP estimator and
the temperature field even in the absence of a correlated CIP signal. For

of MOND on galactic scales with the triumph of the $\Lambda$CDM model on
cosmological scales. This is achieved through the rich and well-studied physics
of superfluidity. The dark matter and MOND components have a common origin,
representing different phases of a single underlying substance. In galaxies,
dark matter thermalizes and condenses to form a superfluid phase. The
superfluid phonons couple to baryonic matter particles and mediate a MOND-like
force. This framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is
successful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher
temperature in clusters, and hence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal
phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a number of
striking observational signatures, which we briefly discuss. Remarkably the
critical temperature and equation of state of the dark matter superfluid are
similar to those of known cold atom systems. Identifying a precise cold atom
analogue would give important insights on the microphysical interactions
underlying DM superfluidity. Tantalizingly, it might open the possibility of
simulating the properties and dynamics of galaxies in laboratory experiments.

in the design of engineering systems where temperature and thermal stress are
of concerns. To date, a variety of measurement techniques are available for
both bulk and thin film solid-state materials with a broad temperature range.
For thermal characterization of bulk material, the steady-state absolute
method, laser flash diffusivity method, and transient plane source method are
most used. For thin film measurement, the 3{\omega} method and transient
thermoreflectance technique including both frequency-domain and time-domain
analysis are employed widely. This work reviews several most commonly used
measurement techniques. In general, it is a very challenging task to determine
thermal conductivity and interface contact resistance with less than 5% error.
Selecting a specific measurement technique to characterize thermal properties
need to be based on: 1) knowledge on the sample whose thermophysical properties
is to be determined, including the sample geometry and size, and preparation
method; 2) understanding of fundamentals and procedures of the testing
technique and equipment, for example, some techniques are limited to samples
with specific geometrics and some are limited to specific range of
thermophysical properties; 3) understanding of the potential error sources
which might affect the final results, for example, the convection and radiation
heat losses.

incoming stellar radiation and outward thermal radiation is described by the
effective planet temperature. Often, it is found to have three different
points, or temperatures, where the influx of radiation is balanced with the
out-flux, even with conserved boundary conditions. Two of these points are
relatively long-term stable, namely the point corresponding to a frozen-climate
and the point corresponding to a hot-climate. The hypothesis promoted in this
paper is the possibility that it is the intermediate third point which is the
basis for habitable-climates. I.e. that this initially unstable point is made
relatively stable over a long period by the presence of seasonal climate
variations. This points to the axial inclination, and perhaps the presence of
orbital eccentricity, as the origin of the stability of the habitable point. An
analysis involving the inclination, the size of the ice caps, and the length of
the year shows that within the currently accepted value of the heat capacity of
the Earth, the otherwise unstable habitable point is stabilized.

a pseudo-elliptical approximation. The probabilities are calculated and
compared for two dark-matter halo profiles, the Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW)
and the Non-Singular-Isothermal-Sphere (NSIS). We demonstrate the power of our
formulation through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the strong lensing
statistics of an X-ray bright sample of low redshift Abell clusters. This KS
test allows to establish limits on the values of the concentration parameter
for the NFW profile ($c_\Delta$) and the core radius for the NSIS profile
(\rc), which are related to the lowest cluster redshift ($z_{\rm cut}$) where
strong arcs can be observed. For NFW dark matter profiles, we infer cluster
haloes with concentrations that are consistent to those predicted by
$\Lambda$CDM simulations. As for NSIS dark matter profiles, we find only upper
limits for the clusters core radii and thus do not rule out a purely SIS model.
For alternative mass profiles, our formulation provides constraints through
$z_{\rm cut}$ on the parameters that control the concentration of mass in the
inner region of the clusters haloes. We find that $z_{\rm cut}$ is expected to
lie in the 0.0--0.2 redshift, highlighting the need to include very low-$z$

well-characterized magnetic field provides a high-fidelity test of the zircons
intrinsic paleomagnetic recording accuracy. Successful dual heating experiments
on nine zircons measured using a superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) microscope yield a mean paleointensity of 46.2 +/- 18.8 microtesla
(1sigma), which agrees closely with high-precision results from Bishop Tuff
whole rock (43.0 +/- 3.2 microtesla). High-resolution quantum diamond magnetic
mapping, electron microscopy, and X-ray tomography indicate that the bulk of
the remanent magnetization in Bishop Tuff zircons is carried by Fe oxides
associated with apatite inclusions, which would be susceptible to destruction
via metamorphism and aqueous alteration in older zircons. As such, while
zircons can reliably record the geomagnetic field, robust zircon-derived
paleomagnetic results require careful characterization of the ferromagnetic
carrier and demonstration of their occurrence in primary inclusions. We further
conclude that a combination of quantum diamond magnetometry and high-resolution

$O(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}(\ln\delta^{-1} + \ln\ln\Delta_i^{-1}))$

$\sim16\,c$ is detected in the jet components, indicating a highly relativistic
jet flow. The brightness temperature of the core is lower than the average

and a relatively lower Doppler boosting factor. The CSS radio classification
indicates that blazar-like $\gamma$-ray properties can also be manifested in
low-power CSS radio sources with appropriate jet and beaming properties.

Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) regularization, enforcing sparsity, and the
SCAD of total variation (TV) regularization, enforcing spatial contiguity, into

optimization problems with explicit solutions. Another virtue of the proposed

solution of a minimally coupled phantom scalar field with a potential. The
studies are carried out for three different spacetimes: asymptotically flat, de
Sitter (dS), and anti de Sitter (AdS). In order to consider the standard odd
parity and even parity of gravitational perturbations, the corresponding master
equations are derived. The QNMs are discussed by evaluating the temporal
evolution of the perturbation field which, in turn, provides direct information
on the stability of BH spacetime. It is found that in asymptotically flat, dS
and AdS spacetimes, the gravitational perturbations have similar
characteristics for both odd and even parities. The decay rate of perturbation
is strongly dependent on the scale parameter $b$, which measures the coupling
strength between phantom scalar field and the gravity. Furthermore, through the
analysis of Hawking radiation, it is shown that the thermodynamics of such
regular phantom BH is also influenced by $b$. The obtained results might shed

by considering a quantum measure that directly determines the runtime for
computing the transition amplitudes. In this paper, we suggest a quantum
measure named ""Fock state concurrence sum"" $C_S$, which is the summation over
all the members of ""the generalized Fock state concurrence"" (a measure
analogous to the generalized concurrences of entanglement and coherence). By
introducing generalized algorithms for computing the transition amplitudes of
the Fock state boson sampling with an arbitrary number of photons per mode, we
show that the minimal classical runtime for all the known algorithms directly
depends on $C_S$. Therefore, we can state that \emph{the Fock state concurrence
sum $C_S$ behaves as a collective measure that controls the computational
complexity of Fock state BS}. We expect that our observation on the role of the

network fine- tuning retain the generalizability of the base network to unseen

present for large plaquette sizes $N_{\rm c}=48$. When the interaction $U$ is
turned on in the strongly fluctuating random potential regions, the electrons
on the low energy states push each other into high energy states in DMFT in a

coverage and transmit powers of MBSs and SBSs. Hence, users may choose to
associate with different types of BSs in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), i.e.,
decoupled access (DA), to enhance spectral efficiency. In this paper, DA in
multiuser MIMO communications is investigated in terms of UL spectral
efficiency. Firstly, we obtain the UL association probabilities. In contrast to
the CA scenario, association probabilities for DA scenario only depend on the
densities of BSs. Hence, DA allows UL and DL to be totally independent.
Secondly, we derive lower bounds on the spectral efficiency. The lower bounds
show that, different from CA, the UL spectral efficiency for DA scenario is
irrelative with the transmit powers of BSs, which implies DA allows users to
associate with any BSs that can achieve the highest UL spectral efficiency.
Finally, the spectral efficiencies for DA and CA scenarios are compared via
simulation results, where it can be concluded that the spectral efficiency in
multiuser MIMO systems is improved by DA.

computation to clouds located at the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO
is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and
enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we study
resource allocation for a multiuser MECO system based on time-division multiple
access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). First,
for the TDMA MECO system with infinite or finite computation capacity, the
optimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for
minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under the constraint on
computation latency. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based
structure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields
priorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing
energy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given
threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for
the cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is
proposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold.
Next, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource
allocation is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer problem. To solve this
challenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a sub-optimal
low-complexity algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its
TDMA counterpart. The corresponding resource allocation is derived by defining
an average offloading priority function and shown to have close-to-optimal
performance by simulation.

collected in Antartica by the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter

near-IR and sub-mm polarization data for a molecular cloud aimed at measuring
the ""polarization efficiency ratio"" ($R_{\mathrm{eff}}$), a quantity that is
expected to depend only on grain intrinsic physical properties. It is defined

both polarization from emission and from extinction, we conducted a careful
selection of near-background stars using 2MASS, $Herschel$ and $Planck$ data.
This selection excludes objects contaminated by the Galactic diffuse background

environment. One important property of the coronagraph is to be able to work in
broadband light.
  Among several proposed coronagraphs, the dual-zone phase mask coronagraph is
a promising solution for starlight rejection in broadband light. In this paper,
we perform the first validation of this concept in laboratory.
  First, we recall the principle of the dual-zone phase mask coronagraph. Then,
we describe the high-contrast imaging THD testbed, the manufacturing of the
components and the quality-control procedures. Finally, we study the
sensitivity of our coronagraph to low-order aberrations (inner working angle
and defocus) and estimate its contrast performance. Our experimental broadband
light results are compared with numerical simulations to check agreement with
the performance predictions.
  With the manufactured prototype and using a dark hole technique based on the
self-coherent camera, we obtain contrast levels down to $2\,10^{-8}$ between 5
and 17$\,\lambda_0/D$ in monochromatic light (640 nm). We also reach contrast
levels of $4\,10^{-8}$ between 7 and 17$\lambda_0/D$ in broadband
($\lambda_0=675$ nm, $\Delta\lambda=250$ nm and $\Delta\lambda / \lambda_0 =
40$ %), which demonstrates the excellent chromatic performance of the dual-zone
phase mask coronagraph.
  The performance reached by the dual-zone phase mask coronagraph is promising
for future high-contrast imaging instruments that aim at detecting and

distributions in a geometrically faithful way. However, the practical impact of
OT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class
of stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems
routinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able
to manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply
requiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in
high-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize
these densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output
the correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two
main ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an
expectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a
smooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms
that have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three
different setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we
show that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's
algorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when
comparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete
reformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient
descent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem
by discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we
propose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apart
from computing OT on finite samples. We backup these claims on a set of
discrete, semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems.

different from the 3-sphere admits irreducible representations of its
fundamental group in SL(2,C). For hyperbolic integer homology spheres this
comes with the definition, and for Seifert fibered integer homology spheres
this is well known. We prove that the splicing of any two non-trivial knots in
the 3-sphere admits an irreducible SU(2)-representation. By work of Boileau,
Rubinstein, and Wang, the general case follows. Using a result of Kuperberg, we
get the corollary that the problem of 3-sphere recognition is in the complexity
class coNP, provided the generalised Riemann hypothesis holds. To prove our
result, we establish a topological fact about the image of the
SU(2)-representation variety of a non-trivial knot complement into the
representation variety of its boundary torus, a pillowcase. For this, we use
holonomy perturbations of the Chern-Simons function in an exhaustive way - we
show that any area-preserving self-map of the pillowcase fixing the four
singular points, and which is isotopic to the identity, can be C^0-approximated
by maps which are realised geometrically through holonomy perturbations of the
flatness equation in a thickened torus. To conclude, we use a stretching
argument in instanton gauge theory, and a non-vanishing result of Kronheimer
and Mrowka for Donaldson's invariants of a 4-manifold which contains the
0-surgery of a knot as a splitting hypersurface.

Encoder-Decoder. It encodes a word sequence (user query) into a fixed-length

also augment the RNN Encoder-Decoder by considering the importance of

  Our geometric proof builds upon nothing else than a simple well-known

particular, it does not rely on factorizations over the semidefinite cone and
thus avoids involved procedures of balancing them as required, e.g., in [Briet,

probably responsible for the properties of the super-massive black holes and
that of the bulges of host galaxies. To understand how this mechanism works, we
need to characterize the geometry and the physical state of the accreting
matter at cosmological redshifts. The few high quality X-ray spectra of distant
QSO have been collected by adding sparse pointings of single objects obtained
during X-ray monitoring campaigns. This could have introduced spurious spectral
features due to source variability. Here we present a single epoch,
high-quality X-ray spectrum of the z=3.62 quasar B1422+231 whose flux is
enhanced by gravitationally lensing (F$_{2-10 keV}\sim$10$^{-12}$erg s$^{-1}$
cm$^{-2}$). The X-ray spectrum of B1422+231 is found to be very similar to the
one of a typical nearby Seyfert galaxy. Neutral absorption is detected
(N$_{H}\sim$5$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ at the redshift of the source) while a
strong absorption edge is measured at E$\sim$7.5 keV with an optical depth of
$\tau\sim$0.14. We also find hints of the FeK$\alpha$ line in emission at
E$\sim$6.4 keV line (EW$\lesssim$70 eV) and a hump is detected in the
E$\sim$15-20 keV energy band (rest-frame) suggesting the presence of a
reflection component. In this scenario, the primary emission of B1422+231 is
most probably dominated by the thermal Comptonization of UV seed photons in a
corona with kT$\sim$40 keV and the reflection component has a relative
direct-to-reflect normalization r$\sim$1. These findings confirm that
gravitational lensing is effective to obtain good quality X-ray spectral
information of quasar at high-z, moreover they support the idea that the same
general picture characterizing active galactic nuclei in the nearby Universe is
valid also at high redshift.

number of models and methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Equity
concerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the
utilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported in
the literature. However, there has been only limited discussion about how
workload equity should be modeled in VRPs, and various measures for optimizing
such objectives have been proposed and implemented without a critical
evaluation of their respective merits and consequences.
  This article addresses this gap with an analysis of classical and alternative
equity functions for biobjective VRP models. In our survey, we review and
categorize the existing literature on equitable VRPs. In the analysis, we
identify a set of axiomatic properties that an ideal equity measure should
satisfy, collect six common measures, and point out important connections
between their properties and those of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions.
To gauge the extent of these implications, we also conduct a numerical study on
small biobjective VRP instances solvable to optimality. Our study reveals two
undesirable consequences when optimizing equity with nonmonotonic functions:
Pareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all
tours are TSP optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be workload inconsistent,
i.e. composed of tours whose workloads are all equal to or longer than those of
other Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that the extent of these phenomena
should not be underestimated. The results of our biobjective analysis are valid
also for weighted sum, constraint-based, or single-objective models. Based on
this analysis, we conclude that monotonic equity functions are more appropriate
for certain types of VRP models, and suggest promising avenues for further
research.

Such dangers can be mitigated by running the enterprise software inside a

We do this through a case-study of Samsung KNOX, a real-world product deployed

recently proven to be a promising control strategy for legged robots.
Computationally efficient and robust algorithms were derived using simplified
models of the contact interaction between robot and environment such as the
linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM). However, as humanoid robots enter more
complex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As
we leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that
can compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the
whole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and
interaction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The
motion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing
force and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum
computation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a
dedicated solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our motion generation
algorithm computes consistent contact forces and joint trajectories for our
humanoid robot. We also demonstrate the favorable time complexity due to our

that when the initial population is uniform, consisting of individuals at the

does not persist. However when the initial population consists of randomly
distributed refractory and susceptible individuals, a single source of
infection can lead to sustained infection in the population, as heterogeneity
facilitates the de-synchronization of the phases in the disease cycle of the
individuals. We also show how the average size of the window of persistence of
infection depends on the degree of heterogeneity in the initial composition of
the population. In particular, we show that the infection eventually dies out
when the entire initial population is susceptible, while even a few
susceptibles among an heterogeneous refractory population gives rise to a large
persistent infected set.

workers. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriors

for each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for the
full posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies:
firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of the
posterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior;
secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to an
importance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posterior
expectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the full
Gaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior density
to re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posterior
expectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it.

This resolution is in agreement with a previous proposal, and indicates a
non-minimal settling to the `splitting problem': an apparent ambiguity in the
holographic entropy formula of certain theories with higher derivatives.

an arbitrary smooth fashion from the standard one. We derive explicit
perturbation formulae for the two eigenvalues closest to zero, taking account
of the second variations. Note that these eigenvalues remain double eigenvalues
under perturbations of the metric: they cannot split because of a particular
symmetry of the Dirac operator in dimension three (it commutes with the
antilinear operator of charge conjugation). Our perturbation formulae show that
in the first approximation our two eigenvalues maintain symmetry about zero and
are completely determined by the increment of Riemannian volume. Spectral
asymmetry is observed only in the second approximation of the perturbation
process. As an example we consider a special family of metrics, the so-called
generalized Berger spheres, for which the eigenvalues can be evaluated
explicitly.

by applications in many fields. Due to experimental limitations, especially in
biology, data could be sampled at low frequencies, leading to significant
challenges in network inference. We introduce the concept of ""system aliasing""
and characterize the minimal sampling frequency that allows reconstruction of
CT systems from low sampled data. A test criterion is also proposed to check
whether system aliasing is presented. With no system aliasing, the paper
provides an algorithm to reconstruct dynamic network from data in the presence
of noise. In addition, when there is system aliasing we perform studies that
add additional prior information of the system such as sparsity. This paper
opens new directions in modelling of network systems where samples have
significant costs. Such tools are essential to process the available data in
applications subject to current experimental limitations.

low-energy electron diffraction state. The formalism is fully relativistic and
allows for a quantitative calculation of the time-dependent photocurrent for

impact ionic conductivity. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of In-LLZO,
in which the In resides at the 48g sites, is predicted to be an order of
magnitude higher than Al-LLZO. Consideration of the simple tetrahedral topology
of the lithium ion conduction network suggests that the increased conductivity
arises because the 48g site sits at a bridge in the lithium ion conduction
network. An immobile ion residing in this location blocks fewer lithium
conduction pathways than an ion, such as Al, that preferentially occupies the
24d site located at a node within the network. In addition, the electronic
structure calculations presented here indicate no large difference in the
stabilities of tetragonal and cubic phases for the aluminum-substituted and
indium-substituted compounds. In both cases, the cubic phase is more stable
than the tetragonal phase. This indicates that it should be possible to make a

ingredients in our approach are the concept of sequentially split
$*$-homomorphisms, and the use of braided tensor products instead of ordinary
tensor products.
  We show that various structure results carry over from the classical theory
to this more general setting. In particular, we show that a number of
$\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic properties relevant to the classification program pass
from the underlying $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra of a Rokhlin action to both the
crossed product and the fixed point algebra. Towards establishing a
classification theory, we show that Rokhlin actions exhibit a rigidity property
with respect to approximate unitary equivalence. Regarding duality theory, we
introduce the notion of spatial approximate representability for actions of
discrete quantum groups. The spatial Rokhlin property for actions of a coexact
compact quantum group is shown to be dual to spatial approximate
representability for actions of its dual discrete quantum group, and vice
versa.

aims to recover the Milky Way's (MW) gravitational potential from large samples

velocities of stars with a parametrized, three-integral distribution function
(DF) in a parametrized axisymmetric potential. We investigate through
differential test cases with idealized mock data how the breakdown of model
assumptions and data properties affect constraints on the potential and DF. Our
key results are: (i) If the MW's true potential is not included in the assumed
model potential family, we can - in the axisymmetric case - still find a robust
estimate for the potential, with only <~ 10% difference in surface density
within |z| <= 1.1 kpc inside the observed volume. (ii) Modest systematic
differences between the true and model DF are inconsequential. E.g, when
binning stars to define sub-populations with simple DFs, binning errors do not
affect the modelling as long as the DF parameters of neighbouring bins differ
by < 20%. In addition, RoadMapping ensures unbiased potential estimates for
either (iii) small misjudgements of the spatial selection function (i.e., <~
15% at the survey volume's edge), (iv) if distances are known to within 10%, or
(v) if proper motion uncertainties are known within 10% or are smaller than
delta mu <~ 1 mas/yr. Challenges are the rapidly increasing computational costs
for large sample sizes. Overall, RoadMapping is well suited to making precise
new measurements of the MW's potential with data from the upcoming Gaia
releases.

bandgap matrix and compare the results with experimental data obtained from the
samples prepared by co-sputtering. The empirical tight-binding technique allows
us to account for the electronic structure under strain on the atomistic level.
We find that a Si shell as thick as 1 monolayer is enough to reduce the
radiative recombination rate as a result of valley $L - X$ cross-over. Thin Si
shell leads to a dramatic reduction of the optical bandgap from visible to
near-infrared range, which is promising for photovoltaics and photodetector
applications. Our detailed analysis of the structure of the confined electron
and hole states in real and reciprocal spaces indicates that the type-II
heterostructure is not yet achieved for Si shells with the thickness below 0.8
nm, despite some earlier theoretical predictions. The energy levels of holes
are affected by the Si shell stronger than the electron states, even though
holes are completely confined to the Ge core. This occurs probably due to a
strong influence of strain on the band offsets.

multiplets being excited at the onset of the spin state transition followed by
the intermediate spin multiplets being excited at the metal insulator

reproduce, from first principles, that the spin state transition and the

proposed transformation, in principle, cannot be used to map exactly a quantum

study the validity of this approach for quantum spin lattice model, we use the
Zassenhaus formula, and we verify how the correction could influence the

quantum decoration transformation because it involves the
second-nearest-neighbor and further nearest neighbor couplings, which leads
into a cumbersome task to establish the equivalence between both lattice

micron (CH_4). J0855-0714 is detected at both wavelengths with signal-to-noise
ratio of ~10 (F110W) and ~4 (CH_4-off) at the peak of the corresponding PSFs.
This is the first detection of J0855-0714 in the H-band. We measure 26.31 +/-
0.10 and 23.22 +/- 0.35 mag in F110W and CH_4 (Vega system). J0855-0714 remains
unresolved in the HST images that have a spatial resolution of 0.22"".
Companions at separations of 0.5 AU (similar brightness) and at ~1 AU (~1 mag
fainter in the F110W filter) are discarded. By combining the new data with
published photometry, we build the spectral energy distribution of J0855-0714
from 0.89 to 22.09 micron, and contrast it against state-of-the-art
solar-metallicity models of planetary atmospheres. We determine a temperature
of 225-250 K, a bolometric luminosity of log L/Lsol = -8.57, and a high surface
gravity of log g = 5.0 (cm/s2), which suggests an old age although such a high
gravity is not fully compatible with evolutionary models. After comparison with
the cooling theory for brown dwarfs and planets, we infer a mass in the
interval 2-10 Mjup for ages of 1-12 Gyr and log g > 3.5 (cm/s2). At the age of
the Sun, J0855-0714 would be a ~5-Mjup free-floating planetary-mass object.
J0855-0714 may represent the old image of the free-floating planetary-mass
objects of similar mass discovered in star-forming regions and young stellar
clusters. As many J0855-0714-like objects as M5-L2 stars may be expected to
populate the solar neighborhood.

  Matrices","27 pages",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using the decomposition of semimagic squares into the associated and balanced
symmetry types as a motivation, we introduce an equivalent representation in
terms of block-structured matrices. This block representation provides a way of
constructing such matrices with further symmetries and of studying their
algebraic behaviour, significantly advancing and contributing to the
understanding of these symmetry properties. In addition to studying classical
attributes, such as dihedral equivalence and the spectral properties of these
matrices, we show that the inherent structure of the block representation
facilitates the definition of low-rank semimagic square matrices. This is
achieved by means of tensor product blocks. Furthermore, we study the rank and
eigenvector decomposition of these matrices, enabling the construction of a
corresponding two-sided eigenvector matrix in rational terms of their entries.
The paper concludes with the derivation of a correspondence between the tensor
product block representations and quadratic form expressions of Gaussian type.

  sub-packetization","Minor changes from the previous version",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An $(n,k,l)$ MDS array code of length $n,$ dimension $k=n-r$ and
sub-packetization $l$ is formed of $l\times n$ matrices over a finite field
$F,$ with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in a distributed
storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. Repair of a failed
node can be performed by accessing a set of $d\le n-1$ helper nodes. The code
is said to have the optimal access property if the amount of data accessed at
each of the helper nodes meets a lower bound on this quantity. For
optimal-access MDS codes with $d=n-1,$ the sub-packetization $l$ satisfies the
bound $l\ge r^{(k-1)/r}.$ In our previous work, for any $n$ and $r,$ we
presented an explicit construction of optimal-access MDS codes with
sub-packetization $l=r^{n-1}.$ In this paper we take up the question of
reducing the sub-packetization value $l$ to make it approach the lower bound.
We construct an explicit family of optimal-access codes with $l=r^{\lceil
n/r\rceil},$ which differs from the optimal value by at most a factor of $r^2.$
These codes can be constructed over any finite field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge
r\lceil n/r\rceil,$ and afford low-complexity encoding and decoding procedures.
We also define a version of the repair problem that bridges the context of
regenerating codes and codes with locality constraints (LRC codes), calling it
group repair with optimal access. In this variation, we assume that the set of
$n=sm$ nodes is partitioned into $m$ repair groups of size $s,$ and require
that the amount of accessed data for repair is the smallest possible whenever
the $d$ helper nodes include all the other $s-1$ nodes from the same group as
the failed node. For this problem, we construct a family of codes with the
group optimal access property. These codes can be constructed over any field
$F$ of size $|F|\ge n,$ and also afford low-complexity encoding and decoding
procedures.

observed properties of local galaxies. The z > 1 epoch is of particular
interest as it was during this time that the volume averaged star formation and
the accretion rate of black holes were maximum. Radiatively driven outflows are
therefore believed to be common during this epoch. We aim to trace and
characterize outflows in AGN hosts with high mass accretion rates at z > 1
using integral field spectroscopy. We obtain spatially-resolved kinematics of
the [OIII]5007 line in two targets which reveal the morphology and spatial
extension of the outflows. We present J and H+K band SINFONI observations of 5
AGNs at 1.2 < z < 2.2. To maximize the chance of observing radiatively driven
outflows, our sample was pre-selected based on peculiar values of the Eddington
ratio and the hydrogen column density of the surrounding interstellar medium.
We observe high velocity (~600-1900 km/s) and kiloparsec scale extended ionized
outflows in at least 3 of our targets, using [OIII]5007 line kinematics tracing
the AGN narrow line region. We estimate the total mass of the outflow, the mass
outflow rate, and the kinetic power of the outflows based on theoretical models
and report on the uncertainties associated with them. We find mass outflow
rates of ~1-10 M_sun/yr for the sample presented in this paper. Based on the
high star formation rates of the host galaxies, the observed outflow kinetic
power and the expected power due to the AGN, we infer that both star formation
and AGN radiation could be the dominant source for the outflows. The outflow
models suffer from large uncertainties, hence we call for further detailed
observations for an accurate determination of the outflow properties to confirm
the exact source of these outflows.

vacuo rotation of the plane of polarization of propagating photons. This
effect, also known as cosmic birefringence, impacts the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropy angular power spectra, producing non-vanishing
$T$--$B$ and $E$--$B$ correlations that are otherwise null when parity is a
symmetry. Here we present new constraints on an isotropic rotation,
parametrized by the angle $\alpha$, derived from Planck 2015 CMB polarization
data. To increase the robustness of our analyses, we employ two complementary
approaches, in harmonic space and in map space, the latter based on a peak
stacking technique. The two approaches provide estimates for $\alpha$ that are
in agreement within statistical uncertainties and very stable against several
consistency tests. Considering the $T$--$B$ and $E$--$B$ information jointly,
we find $\alpha = 0.31^{\circ} \pm 0.05^{\circ} \, ({\rm stat.})\, \pm
0.28^{\circ} \, ({\rm syst.})$ from the harmonic analysis and $\alpha =
0.35^{\circ} \pm 0.05^{\circ} \, ({\rm stat.})\, \pm 0.28^{\circ} \, ({\rm

parity violation and are dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the
orientation of Planck's polarization-sensitive bolometers.

it was suggested that skyrmions with additional degrees of freedom can exist in

antiskyrmions in nanostripes of frustrated magnets is strongly affected by
complex spin states formed at the stripe edges. These states create multiple
edge channels which guide the skyrmion motion. Non-trivial topology of edge
states gives rise to complex current-induced dynamics, such as emission of

surroundings. Due the emission of this energy one can envision an idealized
situation in which the gas entropy remains nearly constant. In this setting, we
derive in this paper interior solutions to the Einstein equations of General
Relativity for spheres which consist of isentropic gas. To accomplish this
objective we derive a single equation for the cumulative mass distribution in
the protostar. From a solution of this equation one can infer readily the
coefficients of the metric tensor. In this paper we present analytic and
numerical solutions for the structure of the isentropic self-gravitating gas.
In particular we look for solutions in which the mass distribution indicates
the presence of shells, a possible precursor to solar system formation. Another
possible physical motivation for this research comes from the observation that
gamma ray bursts are accompanied by the ejection of large amounts of
thermodynamically active gas at relativistic velocities. Under these conditions
it is natural to use the equations of general relativity to inquire about the
structure of the ejected mass.

also obtained for the $\ell_q$ estimation errors with $1\le q\le 2$ when the

are satisfied with high probability for a large class of random matrices with

comparative analysis of conditions, under which oracle bounds for the Lasso and

quantum impurity problem is solved using continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC) and the rotationally invariant slave-boson (RISB) mean field

there are two markedly different regimes determined by the nature of the lowest
energy excitations of the atomic Hamiltonian. The RISB results at $T\to0$
suggest the following rule of thumb for the order of the transition at zero
temperature: a second order transition is to be expected if the lowest lying
excitations of the atomic Hamiltonian are charge excitations, while the
transition tends to be first order if the lowest lying excitations are in the
same charge sector as the atomic ground state. At finite temperatures the
transition is first order and its strength, as measured e.g. by the jump in the
quasiparticle weight at the transition, is stronger in the parameter regime
where the RISB method predicts a first order transition at zero temperature.
Interestingly, these results seem to apply to a wide variety of models and
parameter regimes.

to simple expressions which describe aspects of the geometric behaviour of the

crucial, and a multi-stable regime. In the absence of a multi-stable region,

Under small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is
given by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency vibrational
modes, yet such singular modes are at the epicenter of many interesting
behaviors in the systems above. We consider a system of $N$ spherical
particles, and directly account for the singularities that arise in the sticky
limit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the
contribution to the partition function from singular clusters diverges in the
limit, its asymptotic value can be calculated and depends on only two
parameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result
holds for systems that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization
that describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters.
  To illustrate our theory we address the question of emergence: how does
crystalline order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in
small ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up
to $N\leq 19$, and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic
clusters (those with more than $3N-6$ contacts) -- singular and isostatic
clusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and
configurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to
fragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in
sticky-sphere systems, even those as small as $N=10$.

Game, one of the most famous games in Evolutionary Game Theory. The dynamics of
this game is affected by a number of parameters and processes, namely the
topology of interactions among the agents, the synergy factor, and the strategy
revision phase. The latter is a process that allows agents to change their
strategy. Notably, rational agents tend to imitate richer neighbors, in order
to increase the probability to maximize their payoff. By implementing a
stochastic revision process, it is possible to control the level of noise in
the system, so that even irrational updates may occur. In particular, in this
work we study the effect of noise on the macroscopic behavior of a finite
structured population playing the Public Goods Game. We consider both the case
of a homogeneous population, where the noise in the system is controlled by
tuning a parameter representing the level of stochasticity in the strategy
revision phase, and a heterogeneous population composed of a variable
proportion of rational and irrational agents. In both cases numerical
investigations show that the Public Goods Game has a very rich behavior which
strongly depends on the amount of noise in the system and on the value of the
synergy factor. To conclude, our study sheds a new light on the relations

time-frequency localized version of Fourier basis of $L^2([0,1])$. This
approach is a hybrid between Gabor and Wavelet frames. We construct explicit
and computable examples of these frames, discussing their properties.

prevalent and dangerous pulmonary diseases in the world. It is forecasted that
COPD will be the third deadly disease in the future. Therefore, developing
non-invasive methods for diagnosis of the disease would be helpful for
physicians and patients.
  Methods: Based on clinical investigations and spirometry tests, ten adult
patients with COPD (6 male and 4 female) with mean age of 49.8 years were
enrolled as the case group. In addition, ten age and sex-matched healthy,
non-COPD individuals (6 male and 4 female) with mean age of 45.4 years were
recruited as the controls. Lung CT-scan images of the subjects were processed
and analyzed by a computer to find a relationship.
  Findings: The elasticity of lung parenchyma variation was obtained with
digital image processing. The normalized average of this pattern was found to
be 21.6% in patients and 40.7% in controls. In addition, normalized mean value
of Hounsfield unit variations in square 10 pixel * 10 pixel windows in the
expiratory images were calculated as a parameter of air-trapping in COPD.
Differences between the groups were shown by student t-test (P < 0.05).
  Conclusion: This study showed that the variation of lung parenchyma
elasticity and Hounsfield units are found by processing and analysis of the
full inspiration and expiration images. These factors can be used as criteria
in diagnosis of COPD. Moreover, the severity of the disease can be presented by
the proposed method.

superconducting nanowires have outstanding performance2, but are limited in
their ability to be integrated into large scale arrays due to the engineering
difficulty of high-bandwidth cryogenic electronic readout3-8. Here, we address
this problem by demonstrating a scalable single-photon imager using a single
continuous photon-sensitive superconducting nanowire microwave-plasmon
transmission line. By appropriately designing the nanowire's local
electromagnetic environment so that the nanowire guides microwave plasmons, the
propagating voltages signals generated by a photon-detection event were slowed
down to ~ 2% of the speed of light. As a result, the time difference between
arrivals of the signals at the two ends of the nanowire naturally encoded the
position and time of absorption of the photon. Thus, with only two readout
lines, we demonstrated that a 19.7-mm-long nanowire meandered across an area of
286 {\mu}m * 193 {\mu}m was capable of resolving ~590 effective pixels while
simultaneously recording the arrival times of photons with a temporal
resolution of 50 ps. The nanowire imager presents a scalable approach to
realizing high-resolution photon imaging in time and space.

a two-dimensional flow field at large P\'eclet numbers but otherwise arbitrary

of another reactant, both of which are advected with the known velocity field.
We first establish that the system evolution for such a system under certain
conditions is described by a locally one-dimensional reaction-diffusion
problem. The approximation of a locally one-dimensional dynamics is true for
cases where the strip thickness is smaller than the local radius of curvature
and also when the strip thickness is smaller than the distance between adjacent
strips. We first demonstrate the method for the transport of a conservative
scalar under a linear shear flow, point vortex and a chaotic sine flow. We then
proceed to consider the situation with a simple bimolecular reaction between
two reactants to yield a single product. The methodology presented herewith
essentially generalizes nontrivially the Diffusive Strip Method developed by
Meunier and Villermaux (J. Fluid Mech. 662, 134-172 (2010)) to address passive
scalar transport, to the generalized situation with multiple reacting species.
In essence, the reduction of dimensionality of the problem, which renders the
2D problem 1D, allows one to efficiently model reactive transport under high

the soft constraints systematically utilizing recursion relations. In the pure

the effective actions are further constrained, leading to new

to eight derivatives in terms of just one unknown four-point coefficient and
one more coefficient for ten-derivative terms. Finally, we also study the

century, low heart rate variability has been studied to identify intrauterine

monitoring techniques have been proposed for FHR estimation, including
auscultation and Doppler ultrasound. This thesis focuses on the extraction of
the non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) recorded from a limited set
of abdominal sensors. The main challenge with NI-FECG extraction techniques is
the low signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG signal on the abdominal mixture
signal which consists of a dominant maternal ECG component, FECG and noise.
However the NI-FECG offers many advantages over the alternative fetal
monitoring techniques, the most important one being the opportunity to enable
morphological analysis of the FECG which is vital for determining whether an
observed FHR event is normal or pathological. In order to advance the field of
NI-FECG signal processing, the development of standardised public databases and
benchmarking of a number of published and novel algorithms was necessary.

developed and implemented in a computer algebra code. This code is built as a
superstructure for the computer algebra package by Shevchenko and Sokolsky
(1993a) for normalization of Hamiltonian systems of ordinary differential
equations, in order that high complexity problems of normalization could be
solved. As an example, a resonant normal form of a Hamiltonian describing the
hyperboloidal precession of a dynamically symmetric satellite is derived by
means of the numeric deduction technique. The technique provides a considerable
economy, about 30 times in this particular application, in computer memory
consumption. It is naturally parallelizable. Thus the economy of memory
consumption is convertible into a gain in computation speed.
