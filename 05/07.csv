noises in gravitational wave detectors in terms of the independent component
analysis. First, we consider the simplest case where the detector outputs are
linear combinations of the inputs, consisting of signals and various noises,
and show that this method may be helpful to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
Next, we take into account the time delay between the inputs and the outputs.
Finally, we extend our method to nonlinearly correlated noises and show that
our method can identify the coupling coefficients and remove non-Gaussian
noises. Although we focus on gravitational wave data analysis, our methods are
applicable to the detection of any signals under non-Gaussian noises.

(DE) models. The CMB shift parameter, which traditionally has been used to
determine the main cosmological parameters of the standard model $\Lambda CDM$
is employed in addition to data from redshift-space distortions through the
growth parameter $A(z)=f(z)\sigma_{8}(z)$ to constrain the mass variance
$\sigma_{8}$. BAO data is also used to study the history of the cosmological
expansion and the main properties of DE. From the evolution of $q(z)$ we found
a slowdown of acceleration behaviour at low redshifts, and by using the Akaike
and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC, BIC) we discriminate different models
those that are better suited to the observational data, finding that the
interactive dark energy (IDE) model is the most favoured by observational data,
including information from SNIa and Hz. The analysis shows that the IDE model
is followed closely by EDE and $\Lambda CDM$ models, which in some cases fit
better the observational data with individual probes.

which a server with a database of N equal-size files, each F bits long, serves

i.e., capacity of MF bits. Proactive caching to user terminals is considered,
in which the caches are filled by the server in advance during the placement
phase, without knowing the user requests. Each user requests a single file, and
all the requests are satisfied simultaneously through a shared error-free link
during the delivery phase.
  First, centralized coded caching is studied assuming both the number and the
identity of the active users in the delivery phase are known by the server
during the placement phase. A novel group-based centralized coded caching (GBC)
scheme is proposed for a cache capacity of M = N/K. It is shown that this
scheme achieves a smaller delivery rate than all the known schemes in the
literature. The improvement is then extended to a wider range of cache
capacities through memory-sharing between the proposed scheme and other known
schemes in the literature. Next, the proposed centralized coded caching idea is
exploited in the decentralized setting, in which the identities of the users
that participate in the delivery phase are assumed to be unknown during the
placement phase. It is shown that the proposed decentralized caching scheme
also achieves a delivery rate smaller than the state-of-the-art. Numerical

the groundbreaking work by Hintikka (1962). Despite its various successful
applications in theoretical computer science, AI, and game theory, the
technical development of the field has been mainly focusing on the
propositional part, i.e., the propositional modal logics of ""knowing that"".
However, knowledge is expressed in everyday life by using various other
locutions such as ""knowing whether"", ""knowing what"", ""knowing how"" and so on
(knowing-wh hereafter). Such knowledge expressions are better captured in
quantified epistemic logic, as was already discussed by Hintikka (1962) and his

such a fascinating but largely neglected topic. We first survey what Hintikka
and others did in the literature of quantified epistemic logic, and then

knowing-wh, which we believe can balance expressivity and complexity, and
capture the essential reasoning patterns about knowing-wh. We survey our recent

  Transactions on Information Theory, Oct. 2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For any prime power $q$, Mori and Tanaka introduced a family of $q$-ary polar
codes based on $q$~by~$q$ Reed-Solomon polarization kernels. For transmission
over a $q$-ary erasure channel, they also derived a closed-form recursion for
the erasure probability of each effective channel. In this paper, we use that
expression to analyze the finite-length scaling of these codes on the $q$-ary
erasure channel with erasure probability $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Our primary result
is that, for any $\gamma>0$ and $\delta>0$, there is a $q_{0}$ such that, for
all $q\geq q_{0}$, the fraction of effective channels with erasure rate at most
$N^{-\gamma}$ is at least $1-\epsilon-O(N^{-1/2+\delta})$, where $N=q^{n}$ is
the blocklength. Since this fraction cannot be larger than
$1-\epsilon-O(N^{-1/2})$, this establishes near-optimal finite-length scaling
for this family of codes. Our approach can be seen as an extension of a similar
analysis for binary polar codes by Hassani, Alishahi, and Urbanke.
  A similar analysis is also considered for $q$-ary polar codes with $m$ by $m$
polarizing matrices. This separates the effect of the alphabet size from the
effect of the matrix size. If the polarizing matrix at each stage is drawn
independently and uniformly from the set of invertible $m$ by $m$ matrices,
then the linear operator associated with the Lyapunov function analysis can be
written in closed form. To prove near-optimal scaling for polar codes with
fixed $q$ as $m$ increases, however, two technical obstacles remain. Thus, we
conclude by stating two concrete mathematical conjectures that, if proven,
would imply near-optimal scaling for fixed~$q$.

elements of the group; in the latter case, in addition, we arrive at a unique

Using a partial Hodograph-Legendre transform and the implicit function theorem,
we prove higher order H\""older regularity for the regular free boundary, if the
associated coefficients are of the corresponding regularity. For the zero
obstacle this yields an improvement of a \emph{full derivative} for the free
boundary regularity compared to the regularity of the metric. In the presence
of non-zero obstacles or inhomogeneities, we gain \emph{three halves of a
derivative} for the free boundary regularity with respect to the regularity of
the inhomogeneity. Further we show analyticity of the regular free boundary for
analytic metrics. We also discuss the low regularity set-up of $W^{1,p}$
metrics with $p>n+1$ with and without ($L^p$) inhomogeneities. Key new
ingredients in our analysis are the introduction of generalized H\""older
spaces, which allow to interpret the transformed fully nonlinear, degenerate
(sub)elliptic equation as a perturbation of the Baouendi-Grushin operator,
various uses of intrinsic geometries associated with appropriate operators, the
application of the implicit function theorem to deduce (higher) regularity and
the splitting technique from \cite{KRSI}.

encoding the flow data associated to a Floer functional. A framed flow category
gives rise to a CW-complex with one cell for each object of the category. The
idea is that the Floer invariant should take the form of the stable homotopy
type of the resulting complex, recovering the Floer cohomology as its singular
cohomology. Such a framed flow category was produced, for example, by
Lipshitz-Sarkar from the input of a knot diagram, resulting in a stable
homotopy type generalizing Khovanov cohomology.
  In this paper we give moves that change a framed flow category without
changing the associated stable homotopy type. These are inspired by moves that
can be performed in the Morse-Smale case without altering the underlying smooth
manifold. We posit that if two framed flow categories represent the same stable
homotopy type then a finite sequence of these moves is sufficient to connect
the two categories. This is directed towards the goal of reducing the study of
framed flow categories to a combinatorial calculus.
  We provide examples of calculations performed with these moves (related to
the Khovanov framed flow category), and prove some general results about the
simplification of framed flow categories via these moves.

this average HI mass along with the integral optical $B$-band luminosity of the

large blind 21-cm surveys at $z = 0$ as well as measurements from other HI
stacking experiments at lower redshifts. Our measurement in conjunction with
earlier measurements indicates that there has been no significant evolution of
HI gas abundance over the last 4 Gyr. A weighted mean of $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ from

questionable. We propose an alternative route, building on the correspondence

of high energy physics. It results in a model of Weyl fermions with a random
non-Gaussian imaginary potential which allows one to study the critical

unit vectors that correspond to optimal Grassmannian line packings. It is known
that Grassmannian frames characterized by the Welch bound must satisfy the
restrictive geometric and spectral conditions of being both equiangular and
tight; however, less is known about the necessary properties of other types of
Grassmannian frames. We examine explicit low-dimensional examples of
orthoplectic Grassmannian frames and conclude that, in general, the necessary
conditions for the existence of Grassmannian frames can be much less
restrictive. In particular, we exhibit a pair of $5$-element Grassmannian
frames in $\mathbb C^2$ manifesting with differently sized angle sets and
different reconstructive properties (ie, only one of them is a tight frame).
This illustrates the complexity of the line packing problem, as there are cases
where a solution may coexist with another solution of a different geometric and
spectral character. Nevertheless, we find that these ""twin"" instances still
respect a certain rigidity, as there is a necessary trade-off between their
tightness properties and the cardinalities of their angle sets. The proof of
this depends on the observation that the traceless embedding of Conway, Hardin
and Sloane sends the vectors of a unit-norm, tight frame to a zero-summing set
on a higher dimensional sphere. In addition, we review some of the known bounds
for characterizing optimal line packings in $\mathbb C^2$ and discuss several
examples of Grassmannian frames achieving them.

of particles beyond the Standard Model that are still elusive to experiments.
Among indirect search techniques, which look for stable products from the
annihilation or decay of dark matter particles, or from axions coupling to
high-energy photons, observations of the $\gamma$-ray sky have come to
prominence over the last few years, because of the excellent sensitivity of the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The
LAT energy range from 20 MeV to above 300 GeV is particularly well suited for
searching for products of the interactions of dark matter particles. In this
report we describe methods used to search for evidence of dark matter with the
LAT, and review the status of searches performed with up to six years of LAT
data. We also discuss the factors that determine the sensitivities of these
searches, including the magnitudes of the signals and the relevant backgrounds,
considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We project the
expected sensitivities of each search method for 10 and 15 years of LAT data
taking. In particular, we find that the sensitivity of searches targeting dwarf
galaxies, which provide the best limits currently, will improve faster than the
square root of observing time. Current LAT limits for dwarf galaxies using six
years of data reach the thermal relic level for masses up to 120 GeV for the
$b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel for reasonable dark matter density profiles.
With projected discoveries of additional dwarfs, these limits could extend to
about 250 GeV. With as much as 15 years of LAT data these searches would be
sensitive to dark matter annihilations at the thermal relic cross section for
masses to greater than 400 GeV (200 GeV) in the $b\bar{b}$ ($\tau^+ \tau^-$)
annihilation channels.

polarization at a fixed filling factor can be studied by varying the ratio of
cyclotron and Zeeman energies in tilted magnetic field experiments. However, an
ability to locally control such transitions at a fixed magnetic field would
open a range of attractive applications, e.g. formation of a reconfigurable
network of one-dimensional helical domain walls in a two-dimensional plane.
Coupled to a superconductor, such domain walls can support non-Abelian
excitation. In this article we report development of heterostructures where
quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHFm) transition can be controlled locally by
electrostatic gating. A high mobility two-dimensional electron gas is formed in
CdTe quantum wells with engineered placement of paramagnetic Mn impurities.
Gate-induced electrostatic field shifts electron wavefunction in the growth
direction and changes overlap between electrons in the quantum well and d-shell
electrons on Mn, thus controlling the s-d exchange interaction and the field of
the QHFm transition. The demonstrated shift of the QHFm transition at a filling
factor $\nu=2$ is large enough to allow full control of spin polarization at a
fixed magnetic field.

correlation with lensing, we find an excess of power with respect to the
massless case, due to free streaming neutrinos, roughly at the transition scale
between the linear and non-linear regimes. The excess is $\sim 5-10\%$ at
$l\sim 100$ for the ISW/Rees-Sciama auto power spectrum, depending on the total
neutrino mass $M_\nu$, and becomes a factor of $\sim 4$ for $M_\nu=0.3$ eV, at
$l\sim 600$, for the ISW/Rees-Sciama cross power with CMB-lensing. This effect
should be taken into account for the correct estimation of the CMB temperature

datasets, GPUs have become increasingly necessary to train neural networks.
This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic
gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster
setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch
methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor
conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training
method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train
networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the
network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each
be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because
it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly
non-convex problems. The method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed
setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores.

is subject to the combined effects of environmental stochasticity, competition
for resources, spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dispersal. The population is
spread throughout $n$ patches whose population abundances are modelled as the
solutions of a system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations living on
$[0,\infty)^n$.
  We prove that $r$, the stochastic growth rate of the total population in the
absence of competition, determines the long-term behaviour of the population.
The parameter $r$ can be expressed as the Lyapunov exponent of an associated
linearized system of stochastic differential equations. Detailed analysis shows
that if $r>0$, the population abundances converge polynomially fast to a unique
invariant probability measure on $(0,\infty)^n$, while when $r<0$, the
population abundances of the patches converge almost surely to $0$
exponentially fast. This generalizes and extends the results of Evans et al
(2014 J. Math. Biol.) and proves one of their conjectures.
  Compared to recent developments, our model incorporates very general
density-dependent growth rates and competition terms. Furthermore, we prove
that persistence is robust to small, possibly density dependent, perturbations
of the growth rates, dispersal matrix and covariance matrix of the
environmental noise. Our work allows the environmental noise driving our system
to be degenerate. This is relevant from a biological point of view since, for
example, the environments of the different patches can be perfectly correlated.
As an example we fully analyze the two-patch case, $n=2$, and show that the
stochastic growth rate is a decreasing function of the dispersion rate. In
particular, coupling two sink patches can never yield persistence, in contrast
to the results from the non-degenerate setting treated by Evans et al.

ability of the recently proposed LIMEPY models (Gieles & Zocchi) to reproduce
the dynamical properties of direct N-body models of a cluster in a tidal field,
during its entire evolution. These dynamical models include prescriptions for
the truncation and the degree of radially-biased anisotropy contained in the
system, allowing us to explore the interplay between the role of anisotropy and
tides in various stages of the life of star clusters. We show that the amount
of anisotropy in an initially tidally underfilling cluster increases in the
pre-collapse phase, and then decreases with time, due to the effect of the
external tidal field on its spatial truncation. This is reflected in the
correspondent model parameters, and the best-fit models reproduce the main
properties of the cluster at all stages of its evolution, except for the phases
immediately preceding and following core collapse. We also notice that the
best-fit LIMEPY models are significantly different from isotropic King models,
especially in the first part of the evolution of the cluster. Our results put
limits on the amount of radial anisotropy that can be expected for clusters
evolving in a tidal field, which is important to understand other factors that
could give rise to similar observational signatures, such as the presence of an
intermediate-mass black hole.

density contrast distribution is well modeled by a lognormal PDF convolved with
Poisson noise at angular scales from 10-40 arcmin (corresponding to physical
scales of 3-10 Mpc). We note that as kappa_WL is a weighted sum of the mass

that only spatially dispersive metasurfaces allow realization of perfect
refraction and reflection of incident plane waves into arbitrary directions. In
particular, ideal refraction is possible only if the metasurface is
bianisotropic (weak spatial dispersion), and ideal reflection without

only one order of magnitude in alphabet size. In this paper, we characterize

harvested energy. We assume that all the channel-state-information (CSI) is
perfectly known at the transmitter and all legitimate users are capable of
simultaneously receiving information and harvesting energy. In addition, all
the eavesdroppers are passive and they can harvest energy only when they are

registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution,
but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and
subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus
compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in
CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only
sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most
commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram
statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard
method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically
generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We
determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to
the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram
statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM)
for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and
learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using
Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the
standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM

systems such as those found in airplanes, automobiles, and healthcare.
Traditional security mechanisms for these sensors focus on data encryption and
other post-processing techniques, but the sensors themselves often remain
vulnerable to attacks in the physical/analog domain. If an adversary
manipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of
digital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature
imposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This
work presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme
designed to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring
in the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually
challenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical
probes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that
the adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an
authentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides
resilience against them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PyCRA through
several case studies using two sensing systems: (1) magnetic sensors like those
found wheel speed sensors in robotics and automotive, and (2) commercial RFID
tags used in many security-critical applications. Finally, we outline methods
and theoretical proofs for further enhancing the resilience of PyCRA to active
attacks by means of a confusion phase---a period of low signal to noise ratio
that makes it more difficult for an attacker to correctly identify and respond
to PyCRA's physical challenges. In doing so, we evaluate both the robustness
and the limitations of PyCRA, concluding by outlining practical considerations
as well as further applications for the proposed authentication mechanism.

In the algebraic setting, we propose a method of incorporating nonlinear

source structures, into an effective description of local temporal evolution of
quantum states by using fibrewise perturbations of liouvilleans in the fibre
bundle of Hilbert spaces. In the path integral setting, we incorporate local

entropy in the Jaynes--Mitchell--Favretti renormalisation scheme. As a result,
we show that: 1) the propagation of quantum particles (in Wigner's sense) can
be naturally explained as a free fall along the trajectories locally minimising
the quantum relative entropy; 2) the contribution of particular trajectories to
the global path integral is weighted by the local quantum entropic prior,
measuring user's lack of information; 3) the presence of nonlinear quantum

relativistic magnetic reconnection can naturally account for the formation of
quasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic
fields. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial
scales, so we can capture the asymptotic physics independently of the initial
setup. We characterize the properties of the plasmoids that are continuously
generated as a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process: they are
in rough energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields; the upper
energy cutoff of the plasmoid particle spectrum is proportional to the plasmoid
width w, corresponding to a Larmor radius ~0.2 w; the plasmoids grow in size at
~0.1 of the speed of light, with most of the growth happening while they are
still non-relativistic (first they grow); their growth is suppressed once they
get accelerated to relativistic speeds by the field line tension, up to the
Alfven speed (then they go). The largest plasmoids, whose typical recurrence
interval is ~2.5 L/c, reach a characteristic size w ~ 0.2 L independently of
the system length L, they have nearly isotropic particle distributions and they
contain the highest energy particles, whose Larmor radius is ~0.03 L. The
latter can be regarded as the Hillas criterion for relativistic reconnection.
We briefly discuss the implications of our results for the high-energy emission
from relativistic jets and pulsar winds.

signatures of Majorana Kramers pairs is the quantized differential conductance
of $4e^2/h$ when such a one-dimensional superconductor is coupled to a

phenomenon, can be understood as the boundary condition change for lead
electrons at low energies. In this paper, we study the stability of the Andreev
reflection fixed point with respect to electron-electron interactions in the
Luttinger liquid. We first calculate the phase diagram for the Luttinger
liquid-Majorana Kramers pair junction and show that its low-energy properties
are determined by Andreev reflection scattering processes in the spin-triplet
channel, i.e. the corresponding Andreev boundary conditions are similar to that
in a spin-triplet superconductor - normal lead junction. We also study here a
quantum dot coupled to a normal lead and a Majorana Kramers pair and
investigate the effect of local repulsive interactions leading to an interplay
between Kondo and Majorana correlations. Using a combination of renormalization
group analysis and slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that the system flows
to a new fixed point which is controlled by the Majorana interaction rather
than the Kondo coupling. This Majorana fixed point is characterized by
correlations between the localized spin and the fermion parity of each spin
sector of the topological superconductor. We investigate the stability of the
Majorana phase with respect to Gaussian fluctuations.

order to open gaps with the observed depths and widths. We explore the
dynamical stability of such multi-planet systems using N-body simulations that
incorporate prescriptions for gas effects. We find they can be stable over a
typical disk lifetime, with the help of eccentricity damping from the residual
gap gas that facilitates planets locking into mean motion resonances. However,
in order to account for the occurrence rate of transitional disks, the planet
sculpting scenario demands gap-opening-friendly disk conditions, in particular,
a disk viscosity $\alpha\lesssim0.001$. In addition, the demography of giant
planets at $\sim 3-30$ AU separations, poorly constrained by current data, has
to largely follow occurrence rates extrapolated outward from radial velocity
surveys, not the lower occurrence rates extrapolated inward from direct imaging
surveys. Even with the most optimistic occurrence rates, transitional disks
cannot be a common phase that most gas disks experience at the end of their
life, as popularly assumed, simply because there are not enough planets to open
these gaps. Finally, as consequences of demanding almost all giant planets at
large separations participate in transitional disk sculpting, the majority of
such planets must form early and end up in a chain of mean motion resonances at
the end of disk lifetime.

Using a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations of Milky Way-mass halos
with a fixed final Mvir ~ 10^{12.1}Msun, we find that the presence of
Magellanic Cloud-like satellites strongly correlates with the assembly history,
concentration, and subhalo population of the host halo, such that Milky
Way-mass systems with Magellanic Clouds have lower concentration, more rapid
recent accretion, and more massive subhalos than typical halos of the same
mass. Using a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model that is tuned to
reproduce the stellar mass function of the classical dwarf galaxies of the
Milky Way with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we show that adopting host halos with
different mass-assembly histories and concentrations can lead to different
best-fit models for galaxy-formation physics, especially for the strength of
feedback. These biases arise because the presence of the Magellanic Clouds
boosts the overall population of high-mass subhalos, thus requiring a different
stellar-mass-to-halo-mass ratio to match the data. These biases also lead to
significant differences in the mass--metallicity relation, the kinematics of
low-mass satellites, the number counts of small satellites associated with the
Magellanic Clouds, and the stellar mass of Milky Way itself. Observations of
these galaxy properties can thus provide useful constraints on the properties
of the Milky Way halo.

those used for Monte Carlo approximations (MCMC). In many applications, it is
only of interest to estimate the stationary expectations of a small set of

convergence may be too conservative. Accordingly, we introduce
function-specific analogs of mixing times and spectral gaps, and use them to
prove Hoeffding-like function-specific concentration inequalities. These
results show that it is possible for empirical expectations of functions to
concentrate long before the underlying chain has mixed in the classical sense,
and we show that the concentration rates we achieve are optimal up to
constants. We use our techniques to derive confidence intervals that are
sharper than those implied by both classical Markov chain Hoeffding bounds and
Berry-Esseen-corrected CLT bounds. For applications that require testing,
rather than point estimation, we show similar improvements over recent

general restricts the possible correlations between them. This relationship can
be mediated by unobserved systems, modelled by random variables in the
classical case or joint quantum systems in the quantum case. One way to
differentiate between the correlations realisable by two different causal
structures is to use entropy vectors, i.e., vectors whose components correspond
to the entropies of each subset of the observed variables. To date, the
starting point for deriving entropic constraints within causal structures are
the so-called Shannon inequalities (positivity of entropy, conditional entropy
and conditional mutual information). In the present work we investigate what
happens when non-Shannon entropic inequalities are included as well. We show
that in general these lead to tighter outer approximations of the set of
realisable entropy vectors and hence enable a sharper distinction of different
causal structures. Since non-Shannon inequalities can only be applied amongst
classical variables, it might be expected that their use enables an entropic
distinction between classical and quantum causal structures. However, this
remains an open question. We also introduce techniques for deriving inner
approximations to the allowed sets of entropy vectors for a given causal
structure. These are useful for proving tightness of outer approximations or
for finding interesting regions of entropy space. We illustrate these
techniques in several scenarios, including the triangle causal structure.

irregular and deep dips in their light curves, caused by dust formation. There
are four known hot RCB stars (DY Cen, MV Sgr, V348 Sgr, and HV 2671), with
surface temperatures of 15,000--25,000 K, and prior work has suggested that
three of these have secular fading in brightness. I have tested this result by
measuring century-long light curves in the Johnson B-band with modern
comparison star magnitudes, and I have extended this by measuring many
magnitudes over a wide time range as well as for the fourth hot RCB star. In
all four cases, the B-band magnitude of the maximum light is now fast fading.
The fading rates (in units of magnitudes per century) are 2.5 for DY Cen after
1960, 1.3 for MV Sgr, 1.3 for V348 Sgr, and 0.7 for HV 2671. This secular
fading is caused by the expected evolution of the star across the top of the HR
diagram at constant luminosity, as the temperature rises and the bolometric
correction changes. For DY Cen, the brightness at maximum light is rising from
1906 to 1932, and this is caused by the temperature increase from near 5,800 to
7,500 K. Before 1934 DY Cen had frequent dust dips, while after 1934 there are
zero dust dips, so there is some apparent connection between the rising
temperature and the formation of the dust. Thus, we have watched DY Cen evolve
from an ordinary RCB star up to a hot RCB star and now appearing as an extreme
helium star, all in under one century.

GRBs by comparing the observed counts over a range of time intervals to that
expected from designated background orbits, as well as by using a joint
likelihood technique to model the expected distribution of stacked counts. We
find strong evidence for subthreshold emission at MeV to GeV energies using
both techniques. This observed excess is detected during intervals that include
and exceed the durations typically characterizing the prompt emission observed
at keV energies and lasts at least 2700 s after the co-aligned burst trigger.
By utilizing a novel cumulative likelihood analysis, we find that although a
burst's prompt gamma-ray and afterglow X-ray flux both correlate with the
strength of the subthreshold emission, the X-ray afterglow flux measured by
Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) at 11 hr post trigger correlates far more
significantly. Overall, the extended nature of the subthreshold emission and
its connection to the burst's afterglow brightness lend further support to the
external forward shock origin of the late-time emission detected by the LAT.
These results suggest that the extended high-energy emission observed by the
LAT may be a relatively common feature but remains undetected in a majority of
bursts owing to instrumental threshold effects.

various values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s. We find
that the three methods agree well for small shear viscosity to entropy density
ratio, eta/s, but differ at large eta/s. We find, in particular, that when
using standard viscous hydrodynamics, the bulk-viscous correction can drive the
primordial particle spectra negative at large p_T which is clearly unphysical.
Such a behavior is not seen in either anisotropic hydrodynamics approach,

steeper potential to a nearly flat potential through a discontinuity either in

parametrizations that generate a wide variety of features in the primordial
power spectra incorporating most of the localized and non-local inflationary
features that are obtained upon reconstruction from temperature and
polarization angular power spectrum. At the same time, in a single framework it
allows us to have a background parameter estimation with a nearly free-form

features in the context of Wiggly Whipped Inflation and present the features
that are supported both by temperature and polarization. WWI model provides
more than $13$ improvement in $\chi^2$ fit to the data with respect to the best
fit power law model considering combined temperature and polarization data from

compatible with convex optimization, and we prove that they allow robust

that rank-$r$ strictly-complete measurements are as efficient as rank-$r$

expected kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) signal in intensity and polarization
due to an anisotropic primordial Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We derive
the expected intensity and polarization distortions in the direction of
non-moving galaxy clusters and then we generalize our calculations for non-zero
peculiar velocity. We show that, in the direction of moving clusters, low CMB
multipoles impose intensity and polarization spectral distortions with
different frequency dependences. The polarization signal primarily probes the
quadrupole moment of the CMB, with a significant contribution from the
primordial dipole and octupole moments. For a typical cluster velocity of 1000
km/s, corrections to the quadrupole-induced polarization of a non-moving
cluster are of the order of 2-10% between 200-600 GHz, and depend on cluster's
position on the sky, velocity magnitude and direction of motion. We also find
that the angular dependence of the signal varies with frequency of observation.
The distinct frequency and angular dependences of the polarization induced by
the primordial dipole and octupole can be exploited to measure them despite
other physical effects and foregrounds. Contrary to polarization, intensity
distortions are affected by all the CMB multipoles, so they cannot be readily
used to probe the low multipoles at higher redshifts. However, correlations
between intensity and polarization signals, can be used to enhance the signal
to noise ratio for the measurements of the primordial dipole, quadrupole and
octupole. The more general calculation of the aberration kernel presented in
this work has applications reaching beyond the SZ cluster science addressed
here. For example, it can be exploited to the deboost/deaberrate CMB multipoles
as observed in our local frame.

popular methods in the current literature that train separate classifiers for

traditional grammar formulations: (i) Phrase structure grammar representing the
hierarchical decomposition of the human body from whole to parts; (ii)
Dependency grammar modeling the geometric articulation by a kinematic graph of
the body pose; and (iii) Attribute grammar accounting for the compatibility
relations between different parts in the hierarchy so that their appearances
follow a consistent style. The parse graph outputs human detection, pose
estimation, and attribute prediction simultaneously, which are intuitive and
interpretable. We conduct experiments on two tasks on two datasets, and

with computing poses and attributes independently. Furthermore, our model
obtains better performance over existing methods for both pose estimation and

  Walklets generates these multiscale relationships by subsampling short random

Prime factorization can be also solved by using classical wave interference

factorization includes three major steps. First, general type computer
calculates the sequence of numbers mkmod(N), where N is the number to be

Next, the period of calculated sequence r is determined by exploiting spin wave

perspective, the accuracy and efficiency of such an approach depends on how a

approximated. The $G_0W_0$ approximation is a widely used technique in which
the self energy is expressed as the convolution of a non-interacting Green's
function ($G_0$) and a screened Coulomb interaction ($W_0$) in the frequency
domain. The computational cost associated with such a convolution is high due
to the high complexity of evaluating $W_0$ at multiple frequencies. In this
paper, we discuss how the cost of $G_0W_0$ calculation can be reduced by
constructing a low rank approximation to the frequency dependent part of $W_0$.
In particular, we examine the effect of such a low rank approximation on the
accuracy of the $G_0W_0$ approximation. We also discuss how the numerical
convolution of $G_0$ and $W_0$ can be evaluated efficiently and accurately by

For
instance, the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm of translational symmetry breaking
underlies the classification of nearly all quantum phases of matter and
explains the emergence of crystals, insulators, and superconductors. Usually,
the consequences of translational invariance are studied in large systems to
suppress edge effects which cause undesired symmetry breaking. While this
approach works for investigating global properties, studies of local
observables and their correlations require access and control of the individual
constituents. Periodic boundary conditions, on the other hand, could allow for
translational symmetry in small systems where single particle control is
achievable. Here, we crystallize up to fifteen 40Ca+ ions in a microscopic ring
with inherent periodic boundary conditions. We show the ring's translational
symmetry is preserved at millikelvin temperatures by delocalizing the Doppler
laser cooled ions. This establishes an upper bound for undesired symmetry
breaking at a level where quantum control becomes feasible. These findings pave
the way towards studying quantum many-body physics with translational symmetry
at the single particle level in a variety of disciplines from simulation of
Hawking radiation to exploration of quantum phase transitions.

This approach utilizes penalized regression and sparse estimation principles,
and incorporates outside biological knowledge through a network-based penalty.
The method is tested on simulated data under various scenarios. Simulations
show that with reasonable outside biological knowledge, the new method performs
noticeably better than current stage-wise strategies, especially when the
marginal strength of main effects is weak.
  The proposed method is designed for single-cohort analyses. However, it is
generally acknowledged that only multi-cohort analyses have sufficient power to
uncover genes and gene-by-gene interactions with moderate effects on traits,
such as likely underlie complex diseases. Multi-cohort, meta-analysis
approaches for penalized regressions are developed and investigated in the
second part of this dissertation. Specifically, I propose two different ways of
utilizing data-splitting principles in multi-cohort settings and develop three
procedures to conduct meta-analysis. Using the method developed in the first
part of this dissertation as an example of penalized regressions, three
proposed meta-analysis procedures are compared to mega-analysis using a
simulation study. The results suggest that the best approach is to split the
participating cohorts into two groups.

  Compression","19 pages",,,"UNSW-CSE-TR-201517","cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi Sentence Compression (MSC) is of great value to many real world
applications, such as guided microblog summarization, opinion summarization and
newswire summarization. Recently, word graph-based approaches have been
proposed and become popular in MSC. Their key assumption is that redundancy
among a set of related sentences provides a reliable way to generate
informative and grammatical sentences. In this paper, we propose an effective
approach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle the issue that most of
the state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with: i.e., improving both
informativity and grammaticality at the same time. Our approach consists of
three main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions
(MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking
step to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based
language model (POS-LM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel
approach using a dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences. The
observed improvements on informativity and grammaticality of the generated
compressions show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art MSC
methods.

directed graph with $n$ labeled vertices) has crucial applications in model
checking of temporal logic. It amounts to solving a specific two-players
reachability game, called simulation game. We offer the first conditional lower
bounds for this problem, and we relate its complexity (for computation,
verification, and certification) to some variants of $n\times n$ matrix
multiplication.
  We show that any $O(n^{\alpha})$-time algorithm for simulation games, even
restricting to acyclic games/structures, can be used to compute $n\times n$
boolean matrix multiplication (BMM) in $O(n^{\alpha})$ time. This is the first
evidence that improving the existing $O(n^{3})$-time solutions may be
difficult, without resorting to fast matrix multiplication. In the acyclic
case, we match this lower bound presenting the first subcubic algorithm, based
on fast BMM, and running in $n^{\omega+o(1)}$ time (where $\omega<2.376$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication).
  For both acyclic and cyclic structures, we point out the existence of natural
and canonical $O(n^{2})$-size certificates, that can be verified in truly
subcubic time. In the acyclic case, $O(n^{2})$ time is sufficient, employing
standard matrix product verification. In the cyclic case, a $\max$-semi-boolean
matrix multiplication (MSBMM) is used, i.e., a matrix multiplication on the
semi-ring $(\max,\times)$ where one matrix contains only $0$'s and $1$'s. This
MSBMM is computable (hence verifiable) in truly subcubic
$n^{(3+\omega)/2+o(1)}$ time by reduction to $(\max,\min)$-multiplication.
  Finally, we show a reduction from MSBMM to cyclic simulation games which
implies a separation between the cyclic and the acyclic cases, unless MSBMM can
be verified in $n^{\omega+o(1)}$ time.

of a topological structure in anomalous transport phenomena. In particular,
chiral anomaly turns out to be the underlying mechanism for the negative
longitudinal magnetoresistivity in a Weyl metal phase. Existence of a
dissipationless current channel causes enhancement of electric currents along
the direction of a pair of Weyl points or applied magnetic fields ($B$).
However, temperature ($T$) dependence of the negative longitudinal
magnetoresistivity has not been understood yet in the presence of disorder
scattering since it is not clear at all how to introduce effects of disorder
scattering into the ""topological-in-origin"" transport coefficient at finite
temperatures. The calculation based on the Kubo formula of the current-current
correlation function is simply not known for this anomalous transport
coefficient. Combining the renormalization group analysis with the Boltzmann
transport theory to encode the chiral anomaly, we reveal how disorder
scattering renormalizes the distance between a pair of Weyl points and such a
renormalization effect modifies the topological-in-origin transport coefficient
at finite temperatures. As a result, we find breakdown of $B/T$ scaling, given
by $B/T^{1 + \eta}$ with $0 < \eta < 1$. This breakdown may be regarded to be a
fingerprint of the interplay between disorder scattering and topological
structure in a Weyl metal phase.

topological spin Meissner states can in principle be observed at arbitrary high
magnetic field not limited by the critical magnetic field value for the
condensate in a simply-connected geometry. One special example of the
topological Meissner states are half-vortices. We show that in the absence of
magnetic field half-vortices in a ring exist in a form of superposition of
elementary half-vortex states which resolves recent experimental results where
such puzzling superposition was observed. Furthermore, we show that if a pure
half-vortex state is to be observed, a non-zero magnetic field of a specific
magnitude needs to be applied. Studying exciton-polariton in a ring in presence
of TE-TM splitting, we observe spin Meissner states which break rotational
symmetry of the system by developing inhomogeneous density distributions. We
classify various states arising in presence of non-zero TE-TM splitting based
on what states they can be continued from by increasing the TE-TM splitting
parameter from zero. With further increasing TE-TM splitting, states with
broken symmetry may transform into stable half-dark solitons and therefore may
serve as a useful tool to generate various non-trivial states of a spinor

  Yet, no examples or previous revisions may be available. In spite of the

assessment if the person on the receiving end has a bad image. In this case,
the choice about whether or not to give help to the potential receiver does not
affect the image of the potential giver. We analyze the Staying norm in terms

establishing cooperation compared to the prevailing social norms, which rely on
constant monitoring and unconditional assessment. The application of Staying

subgraph problem. In particular, in analysis of metabolic networks a
generalized maximum-weight connected subgraph (GMWCS) problem, where both nodes
and edges are scored, naturally arises. Here we present the first to our
knowledge practical exact GMWCS solver. We have tested it on real-world
instances and compared to similar solvers. First, the results show that on
node-weighted instances GMWCS solver has a similar performance to the best
solver for that problem. Second, GMWCS solver is faster compared to the closest
analogue when run on GMWCS instances with edge weights.

correlators at large but finite coupling in quantum field theories with gravity

the presence of higher derivative $R^2$ and $R^4$ terms in the action, focusing
on the dual to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We observe
the appearance of new poles in the complex frequency plane at finite coupling.
The new poles interfere with hydrodynamic poles of the correlators leading to
the breakdown of hydrodynamic description at a coupling-dependent critical
value of the wave-vector. The dependence of the critical wave vector on the
coupling implies that the range of validity of the hydrodynamic description
increases monotonically with the coupling. The behavior of the quasinormal
spectrum at large but finite coupling may be contrasted with the known
properties of the hierarchy of relaxation times determined by the spectrum of a
linearized kinetic operator at weak coupling. We find that the ratio of a
transport coefficient such as viscosity to the relaxation time determined by
the fundamental non-hydrodynamic quasinormal frequency changes rapidly in the
vicinity of infinite coupling but flattens out for weaker coupling, suggesting
an extrapolation from strong coupling to the kinetic theory result. We note
that the behavior of the quasinormal spectrum is qualitatively different
depending on whether the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is greater
or less than the universal, infinite coupling value of $\hbar/4\pi k_B$. In the
former case, the density of poles increases, indicating a formation of branch
cuts in the weak coupling limit, and the spectral function shows the appearance
of narrow peaks. We also discuss the relation of the viscosity-entropy ratio to
conjectured bounds on relaxation time in quantum systems.

necessary to calculate the third derivative of $w$ for them to estimate the

intracellular gradients of signaling molecules that reflect the extracellular
chemical gradient - an ability called directional sensing. Quantitative
experiments have revealed two characteristic input-output relations of the
system: First, in a static chemoattractant gradient, the shapes of the
intracellular gradients of the signaling molecules are determined by the
relative steepness, rather than the absolute concentration, of the
chemoattractant gradient along the cell body. Second, upon a spatially
homogeneous temporal increase in the input stimulus, the intracellular
signaling molecules are transiently activated such that the response magnitudes
are dependent on fold changes of the stimulus, not on absolute levels. However,
the underlying mechanism that endows the system with these response properties
remains elusive. Here, by adopting a widely used modeling framework of
directional sensing, local excitation and global inhibition (LEGI), we propose
a hypothesis that the two rescaling behaviors stem from a single design
principle, namely, invariance of the governing equations to a scale
transformation of the input level. Analyses of the LEGI-based model reveal that
the invariance can be divided into two parts, each of which is responsible for
the respective response properties. Our hypothesis leads to an experimentally
testable prediction that a system with the invariance detects relative
steepness even in dynamic gradient stimuli as well as in static gradients.
Furthermore, we show that the relation between the response properties and the
scale invariance is general in that it can be implemented by models with
different network topologies.

depending on the particular aims/resources of a study. Such different models
often provide qualitatively concordant predictions over specific
parametrisations, but it is generally unclear whether model predictions are
quantitatively in agreement, and whether such agreement holds for different
parametrisations. Here we present a generally applicable statistical machine
learning methodology to automatically reconcile the predictions of different
models across abstraction levels. Our approach is based on defining a
correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order
to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system.
We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of
the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications.

the modular organization of the hierarchical network with its high degree of

strictly apply. A classical example is a superconductor-magnet hybrid system
where magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting
condensate and results in the stabilisation of an odd-frequency superconducting

superconductivity should manifest in the Meissner state as fluctuations in the

either repel (diamagnetic) or attract (paramagnetic) external magnetic flux.

Our focus is on predicting experimental behavior in single wires in the quantum
limit where temperature is reduced to zero. We show that changing the Fermi
energy $E_F$ can tune a wire from from ballistic to diffusive conduction and to
localization. In both ballistic and diffusive single wires we find both
Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations with similar strengths,
accompanied by quite strong universal conductance fluctuations (UCFs), all with
amplitudes between $0.3 \, G_0$ and $1\,G_0$. This contrasts strongly with the
average behavior of many wires, which shows Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the
ballistic regime and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations in the diffusive
regime, with both oscillations substantially larger than the conductance
fluctuations. In single wires the ballistic and diffusive regimes can be
distinguished by varying $E_F$ and studying the sign of the AB signal, which
depends periodically on $E_F$ in ballistic wires and randomly on $E_F$ in
diffusive wires. We also show that in long wires the perfectly conducting
channel is visible at a wide range of energies within the bulk gap. We present
typical conductance profiles at several wire lengths, showing that conductance

contain valuable information. By inspecting these two curves individually we
gain more insight into the cause and structure of volatility. Several examples
are provided where the tick-time volatility curve is much smoother than the

microstructure noise only influences the estimation of the (smooth) tick-time

This results in a type theory with a small set of rules, while still being
fairly expressive. For example, all well-known basic types and type formers
that are needed for using this type theory as a logic are definable:
propositional connectives, like falsity, conjunction, disjunction, and function
space, dependent function space, existential quantification, equality, natural
numbers, vectors etc. The reduction relation on terms consists solely of a rule
for recursion and a rule for corecursion. The reduction relations for
well-known types arise from that. To further support the introduction of this
new type theory, we also prove fundamental properties of its term calculus.
Most importantly, we prove subject reduction and strong normalisation of the
reduction relation, which gives computational meaning to the terms.
  The presented type theory is based on ideas from categorical logic that have
been investigated before by the first author, and it extends Hagino's
categorical data types to a dependently typed setting. By basing the type
theory on concepts from category theory we maintain the duality between
inductive and coinductive types, and it allows us to describe, for example, the

  Temperature-Dependence","45 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Equations that govern the temperature-dependence of the rate constants, Gibbs
energies,enthalpies, entropies and heat capacities of activation for folding
and unfolding of spontaneously-folding fixed two-state systems have been
derived using a procedure that treats the denatured and the native conformers
as being confined to harmonic Gibbs energy wells. The notion that a two-state
system is physically defined only for a set temperature range is introduced.
The implications of this novel treatment for protein folding are discussed.

wireless data rates and link reliability by using large numbers of antennas
(more than 64) at the base transceiver station (BTS). Extra antennas help by
focusing the transmission and reception of signal energy into ever-smaller
regions of space. This brings huge improvements in throughput. However, it
requires a large number of Radio Frequency (RF) chains (usually equal to number
of transmit antennas), which is a major drawback. One approach to overcome
these issues is to use Spatial Modulation (SM). In SM, an index of transmit
antenna is used as an additional source of information to improve the overall
spectral efficiency. In particular, a group of any number of information bits
is mapped into two constellations: a signal constellation based on modulation
scheme and a spatial constellation to encode the index of the transmit antenna.
However, a low spectral efficiency is main drawback of SM. Therefore, a
combination of SM with Spatial Multiplexing is an effective way to increase
spectral efficiency with limited number of RF chains.

  Categorical Spaces","18 pages",,,,"math.DG gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In category theory, logic and geometry cooperate with each other producing
what is known under the name Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG). The main
difference between SDG and standard differential geometry is that the
intuitionistic logic of SDG enforces the existence of infinitesimal objects
which essentially modify the local structure of spaces considered in SDG. We
focus on an ""infinitesimal version"" of SDG, an infinitesimal $n$-dimensional
formal manifold, and develop differential geometry on it. In particular, we
show that the Riemann curvature tensor on infinitesimal level is itself
infinitesimal. We construct a heuristic model $S^3 \times \mathbb{R} \subset
\mathbb{R}^4$ and study it from two perspectives: the perspective of the
category SET and that of the so-called topos $\mathcal{G}$ of germ-determined
ideals. We show that the fact that in this model the curvature tensor is
infinitesimal (in $\mathcal{G}$-perspective) eliminates the existing
singularity. A surprising effect is that the hybrid geometry based on the
existence of the infinitesimal and the SET levels generates an exotic smooth
structure on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We briefly discuss the obtained results and
indicate their possible applications.

reference frames have been obtained. A common case when the movement speed of
one coordinate frame in relation to another one can have time derivatives of
higher orders. The obtained transformations conserve invariance of the
space-time interval, and in the particular case of inertial frames become the
well-known Lorentz transformations. It is shown that the transition from
classical mechanics to the theory of relativity is analogous to the
consideration of the vibrating system described by the equation of the
sine-Gordon type. In this case, if the amplitude of the elliptic functions is
$k\to 0$ the fluctuations can be considered small, and that leads to classical
mechanics. With $k\to 1$ time depends on the vibration amplitude, which leads
to the theory of relativity. In the case of inertial frames the amplitude is
$k=\beta ={v}/{c}\;$.

by the collineations of two (pseudo)metrics, which are defined in the spaces of
independent and dependent variables. We demonstrate the general results in two
special cases (a) a system of $m$ coupled Laplace equations and (b) the
Klein-Gordon equation of a particle in the context of Generalized Uncertainty
Principle. In the second case we determine the complete invariant group of

from 1,315 overweight or obese individuals, aged 40-65 years was used. Asthma
was self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque
index were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic
regression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family
history of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of
asthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence
interval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis . On
the other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not
statistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR
of taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that
of a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP
sites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque
index still remained non-significant. Conclusion: Participants with severe
periodontitis were less likely to have asthma. Stronger evidence of an inverse
association was found when using asthma medication as outcome. Keywords:

is the construction of the underlying knowledge base. As a consequence, the
rate of progress in the development of this type of system is directly related
to the speed with which knowledge bases can be assembled, and on its quality.
We attempt to solve the knowledge acquisition problem, for a Business
Information System, developing a supervised multistrategy learning paradigm.
This paradigm is centred on a collaborative data mining strategy, where groups
of experts collaborate using data-mining process on the supervised acquisition
of new knowledge extracted from heterogeneous machine learning data models.
  The Actias system is our approach to this paradigm. It is the result of
applying the graphic logic based language of sketches to knowledge integration.
The system is a data mining collaborative workplace, where the Information
System knowledge base is an algebraic structure. It results from the
integration of background knowledge with new insights extracted from data
models, generated for specific data modelling tasks, and represented as rules
using the sketches language.
