  Mortality at Hospitals with Superior Nursing","20 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is effect modification if the magnitude or stability of a treatment
effect varies systematically with the level of an observed covariate. A larger
or more stable treatment effect is typically less sensitive to bias from
unmeasured covariates, so it is important to recognize effect modification when
it is present. We illustrate a recent proposal for conducting a sensitivity
analysis that empirically discovers effect modification by exploratory methods,
but controls the family-wise error rate in discovered groups. The example
concerns a study of mortality and use of the intensive care unit in 23,715
matched pairs of two Medicare patients, one of whom underwent surgery at a
hospital identified for superior nursing, the other at a conventional hospital.
The pairs were matched exactly for 130 four-digit ICD-9 surgical procedure
codes and balanced 172 observed covariates. The pairs were then split into five
groups of pairs by CART in its effort to locate effect modification. The
evidence of a beneficial effect of magnet hospitals on mortality is least
sensitive to unmeasured biases in a large group of patients undergoing rather
serious surgical procedures, but in the absence of other life-threatening
conditions, such as a comorbidity of congestive heart failure or an emergency
admission leading to surgery.

a low-power radio AGN with a kpc-size one-sided jet and a large, nearly polar
HI disc. It is therefore a good system to study to understand the relation
between the availability of cold-gas and the triggering of AGNs in galaxies.
Our new WSRT data reveal two faint, S-shaped radio lobes extending out to
$\sim$10 kpc from the galaxy centre. Remarkably, we find that the inner HI disc
warps back towards the stellar mid-plane in a way that mirrors the warping of
the radio lobes. We suggest that the polar HI disc was accreted through a minor
merger, and that the torques causing it to warp in the inner regions are also
responsible for feeding the AGN. The ""S"" shape of the radio lobes would then be
due to the radio jets adapting to the changing angular momentum of the accreted
gas. The extended radio jets are likely poorly collimated, which would explain
their quick fading and, therefore, their rarity in galaxies similar to NGC
3998. The fuelling of the central super-massive black hole is likely occurring
via ""discrete events"", suggested by the observed variability of the radio core
and the extremely high core dominance, which we attribute to the formation and
ejection of a new jet resulting from a recent fuelling event.

observed in the Chandra spectra indicates that all the NuSTAR sources are in
the central bulge or are of extragalactic origin. Spectral analysis of
relatively bright NuSTAR sources suggests that magnetic cataclysmic variables
constitute a large fraction (>40-60%). Both spectral analysis and logN-logS

enhancing UX integration. The aim of the meeting was to reflect on, learn from,
and coordinate various activities spanned across various organizational units

project retrospective meetings in SPI. This approach is a refinement of a
similar approach that is used in Agile projects, and is shown to improve
effectiveness of, and decrease memory bias. We hypothesized that this method
can be useful in the context of UX integration, and in this broader scope. To
evaluate the method we gathered practitioners' view through a questionnaire.
The findings showed our hypothesis to be plausible. Here, we present that UX

We also show that such cross-section evidence-based timeline retrospective
meetings are useful for UX integration, and in a larger scale than one project,
especially for identifying and reflecting on 'organizational issues'. This

tools for deducing structural characteristics of galaxies, such as disk sizes,

a fundamental constraint set by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on the
observed structural and dynamical characteristics of galaxies, as deduced from
dust continuum and CO-line imaging at high redshifts. As the CMB temperature
rises in the distant Universe, the ensuing thermal equilibrium between the CMB
and the cold dust and H$_2$ gas progressively erases all spatial and spectral
contrasts between their brightness distributions and the CMB. For high-redshift
galaxies, this strongly biases the recoverable H$_2$ gas and dust mass
distributions, scale lengths, gas velocity fields and dynamical mass estimates.
This limitation is unique to mm/submm wavelengths and unlike its known effect
on the global dust continuum and molecular line emission of galaxies, it cannot
be addressed simply. We nevertheless identify a unique signature of
CMB-affected continuum brightness distributions, namely an increasing rather
than diminishing contrast between such brightness distributions and the CMB
when the cold dust in distant galaxies is imaged at frequencies beyond the
Raleigh-Jeans limit. For the molecular gas tracers, the same effect makes the
atomic carbon (CI) lines maintain a larger contrast than the CO lines against
the CMB.

$\partial\Omega$ having positive $d-1$ measure. For vector valued functions,
zero mean conditions are imposed on components (e.g., normal components) of the
function on certain $d-1$ dimensional manifolds (e.g., on plane or curvilinear
faces of $\partial\Omega$).
  We find explicit and simply computable bounds of the respective constants for
domains typically used in finite element methods (triangles, quadrilaterals,
tetrahedrons, prisms, pyramids, and domains composed of them). The second part
of the paper discusses applications of the estimates to interpolation of scalar

every network predicate, each network configuration that satisfies this
predicate can be proved using distributed certificates which can be verified
locally. However, this requires to leak information about the identities of the
nodes in the certificates, which might not be applicable in a context in which
privacy is desirable. Unfortunately, it is known that if one insists on
certificates independent of the node identities, then not all network
predicates can be proved using distributed certificates that can be verified
locally. In this paper, we prove that, for every network predicate, there is a
distributed protocol satisfying the following two properties: (1) for every
network configuration that is legal w.r.t. the predicate, and for any attempt
by an adversary to prove the illegality of that configuration using distributed
certificates, there is a locally verifiable proof that the adversary is wrong,
also using distributed certificates; (2) for every network configuration that
is illegal w.r.t. the predicate, there is a proof of that illegality, using
distributed certificates, such that no matter the way an adversary assigns its
own set of distributed certificates in an attempt to prove the legality of the
configuration, the actual illegality of the configuration will be locally
detected. In both cases, the certificates are independent of the identities of
the nodes. These results are achieved by investigating the so-called local
hierarchy of complexity classes in which the certificates do not exploit the
node identities. Indeed, we give a characterization of such a hierarchy, which

initial data to the Einstein-scalar-field system which are decaying towards
(future null) infinity give rise to solutions which are foward-in-time global
(in the sense of future causal geodesic completeness). We construct a class of
spherically symmetric solutions which are global but the initial norms are
consistent with initial data not decaying towards infinity. This gives the
following consequences: (1) We prove that there exist foward-in-time global
solutions with arbitrarily large (and in fact infinite) initial bounded
variation (BV) norms and initial Bondi masses. (2) While general solutions with
non-decaying data do not approach Minkowski spacetime, we show using the
results of Luk--Oh that if a sufficiently strong asymptotic flatness condition
is imposed on the initial data, then the solutions we construct (with large BV
norms) approach Minkowski spacetime with a sharp inverse polynomial rate. (3)
Our construction can be easily extended so that data are posed at past null
infinity and we obtain solutions with large BV norms which are causally
geodesically complete both to the past and to the future. Finally, we discuss
applications of our method to construct global solutions for other nonlinear
wave equations with infinite critical norms.

communication between user equipment (UE) and base station (BS) and ii)
in-sufficient spacing between antenna elements. We propose to shape transmit
signals at adjacent antennas with distinct interpolating filters which
introduces pulse shaping diversity eventually leading to improved SINR and
throughput at the UEs. In this technique, each antenna transmits its own data
stream with a relative offset with respect to adjacent antenna. The delay which
must be a fraction of symbol period is interpolated with the pulse shaped
signal and generates a virtual MIMO channel that leads to improved diversity
and SINR at the receiver. Note that non-integral sampling periods with
inter-symbol interference (ISI) should be mitigated at the receiver. For this,
we propose to use a fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) designed based on the
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Simulation results show that for a
2x2 MIMO and with inter-site-distance (ISD) of 50 m, the median received SINR

effect when both the coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum
noncommutativities are considered. This study is motivated by the recent
observation that there is no net phase shift in the time-dependent AB effect on
the ordinary space, and therefore tiny derivation from zero can indicate new
physics. The vanishing of the time-dependent AB phase shift on the ordinary
space is preserved by the gauge and Lorentz symmetries. However, on the
noncomutative phase space, while the ordinary gauge symmetry can be kept by the
Seiberg-Witten map, but the Lorentz symmetry is broken. Therefore nontrivial
noncommutative corrections are expected. We find there are three kinds of
noncommutative corrections in general: 1) $\xi$-dependent correction which
comes from the noncommutativity among momentum operators; 2) momentum-dependent
correction which is rooted in the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative
extended model; 3) momentum-independent correction which emerges become of the
gauge invariant condition on the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative
model. We proposed two dimensionless quantities, which are based on the
distributions of the measured phase shift with respect to the external magnetic
field and to the cross section enclosed by the particle trajectory, to extract
the noncommutative parameters. We find that stronger (weaker) magnetic field
strength can give better bounds on the coordinate-coordinate

energies of bulk materials with high accuracy, but it encounters difficulties
when calculating whole dissociation curves. The reason is that its standard
formalism is based on a single Hartree-Fock (HF) configuration whose orbitals
are localized and used for the many-body expansion. Therefore, in those
situations where HF does not allow a size-consistent description of the
dissociation, the MoI cannot yield proper results either. Herein we address the
problem by employing a size-consistent multiconfigurational reference for the
MoI formalism. This leads to a matrix equation where a coupling derived by the
reference itself is employed. In principle, such approach allows one to
evaluate approximate values for the ground as well as excited states energies.
While the latter are accurate close to the avoided crossing only, the ground
state results are very promising for the whole dissociation curve, as shown by
the comparison with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) benchmarks. We
tested this two-state constant-coupling (TSCC)-MoI on beryllium rings of

four dimensional gravitational theories.The construction is explicitly done in
the superspace and the tree-level perturbative unitarity is explicitly proved
both in the superfield formalism and in field components. For the minimal
nonlocal supergravity the spectrum is the same as in the local theory and in
particular it is ghost-free. The supersymmetric extension of the
super-renormalizable Starobinsky theory and of two alternative massive nonlocal
supergravities are found as straightforward applications of the formalism.
Power-counting arguments ensure super-renormalizability with milder requirement
for the asymptotic behavior of form factors than in ordinary nonlocal gravity.
The most noteworthy result, common to ordinary supergravity, is the absence of
quantum corrections to the cosmological constant in any regularization
procedure. We cannot exclude the usual one-loop quadratic divergences. However,
local vertices in the superfields, not undergoing renormalization, can be
introduced to cancel out such divergences. Therefore, quantum finiteness is
certainly achieved in dimensional regularization and most likely also in the
cut-off regularization scheme. We also discuss the n-point scattering
amplitudes making use of a general field redefinition theorem implemented in
the superspace. Finally, we show that all the exact solutions of the local
supergravity in vacuum are solutions of the nonlocal one too. In particular, we
have the usual Schwarzschild singularity. We infer that the weak nonlocality,
even in the presence of minimal supersymmetry, is not sufficient to solve the
spacetime singularities issue, although the theory is finite at quantum level.

measurement is only outperformed by a small factor. Specifically, we confirm,
that an optimal measurement choice under lossless conditions is the parity
measurement. In addition, we also discuss the performance of several other

phase drift, and thermal photon noise. We conclude that, with noise
considerations, homodyne remains near optimal in both the low and high power

$J=1-0$ $^{12}$CO line, generating 16 synthetic catalogs (four different
spatial resolutions and four CO abundance models), each containing up to
several thousands MCs. The comparison with the observations focuses on the mass
and size distributions and on the velocity-size and mass-size Larson relations.
The mass and size distributions are found to be consistent with the
observations, with no significant variations with spatial resolution or
chemical model, except in the case of the unrealistic model with constant CO
abundance. The velocity-size relation is slightly too steep for some of the
models, while the mass-size relation is a bit too shallow for all models only
at a spatial resolution $dx\approx 1$ pc. The normalizations of the Larson
relations show a clear dependence on spatial resolution, for both the synthetic

that the SN rate in the Perseus arm is approximately 70\% or less of the rate
adopted in the simulation. Overall, the realistic properties of the synthetic
clouds confirm that supernova-driven turbulence can explain the origin and

planar configuration with a saturated local moment of 1.5 $\mu_B$, and a
metastable non-planar configuration with a vanishing magnetic moment, at a
modest energy expense of ~50 meV. Though non-planarity relieves the lattice of
vacancy-induced strain, the planar state is energetically favored due to
maximally localized defect states (v$\sigma$, v$\pi$). In the planar
configuration, charge transfer from itinerant (Dirac) states weakens the
spin-polarization of v$\pi$ yielding a fractional moment, which is aligned
parallel to the unpaired v$\sigma$ electron through Hund's coupling. In the
non-planar configuration, the absence of orthogonal symmetry allows interaction
between v$\sigma$ and local d$\pi$ states, to form a hybridized
v$\sigma^\prime$ state. The non-orthogonality also destabilizes the Hund's
coupling, and an antiparallel alignment between v$\sigma$ and v$\pi$ lowers the
energy. The gradual spin reversal of v$\pi$ with increasing non-planarity opens
up the possibility of an intermediate structure with balanced v$\pi$ spin
population. If such a structure is realized under external perturbations,
diluted vacancy concentration may lead to v$\sigma$ based spin-1/2
paramagnetism.

decrease systematically with decreasing Q/M, scaling as (Q/M)$^\alpha$ with
$\alpha$ varying between $\sim$0.2-3; 3) $\alpha$ is well correlated with Fe/O

the spectra steepen significantly at higher energy with $\gamma_b$-$\gamma_a

GLEs) are Fe-rich, have $\alpha >$1.4, have flatter spectra at low and high

$\gamma_1$, and $\gamma_b$ and the systematic Q/M dependence of $E_B$ within an
event, as well as the range of values for $\alpha$ suggest that the formation
of double power-laws in SEP events occurs primarily due to diffusive
acceleration at near-Sun CME shocks and not due to scattering in the
interplanetary turbulence. In most events, the Q/M-dependence of $E_B$ is
consistent with the equal diffusion coefficient condition while the
event-to-event variations in $\alpha$ are probably driven by differences in the
near-shock wave intensity spectra, which are flatter than the Kolmogorov
turbulence spectrum but still weaker compared to that inferred for the extreme
events.

weakly on the chosen parametrization of astrophysical reionization. For light
dark matter particles that decay exclusively into electromagnetic components
this implies a limit of $\Gamma < 5.3 \times 10^{-26}/$s at $95$\% C.L.

items from noisy pairwise comparisons. In our setting, we are non-actively
given $r$ pairwise comparisons between each pair of $n$ items, where each

$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$; i.e. to solve any instance of top-$K$, our algorithm
needs at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ times as many samples needed as the best

$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ or worse). We further show that this is tight: any

Its central star, a
hot DAOZ white dwarf (WD), is a prototype of a rare class of PN nuclei
associated with dense, compact emission-line knots. The central star also shows
excess fluxes in both the near- (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR). In a 2013 paper,
we used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to show that the compact nebula is
a point-like source, located 0"".16 (~118 AU) from the WD. We attributed the NIR
excess to an M dwarf companion star, which appeared to coincide with the dense
emission knot. We now present new ground-based NIR spectroscopy, showing that
the companion is actually a much cooler source with a continuous spectrum,
apparently a dust-enshrouded low-luminosity star. New HST images confirm common
proper motion of the emission knot and red source with the WD. The I-band, NIR,

fit the spectral-energy distribution with four blackbodies (the WD, a ~1850 K
NIR component, and MIR dust at 385 and 175 K). Alternatively, we show that the
NIR/MIR SED is very similar to that of Class 0/I young stellar objects. We
suggest a scenario in which the EGB 6 nucleus is descended from a wide binary
similar to the Mira system, in which a portion of the wind from an AGB star was
captured into an accretion disk around a companion star; a remnant of this disk
has survived to the present time, and is surrounded by gas photoionized by UV

rate, and a large collisional family, making it one of the most interesting
objects in the outer solar system. A fully self-consistent formation scenario
responsible for the satellite and family formation is still elusive, but some
processes predict the initial formation of many small moons, similar to the
small moons recently discovered around Pluto. Deep searches for regular
satellites around KBOs are difficult due to observational limitations, but
Haumea is one of the few for which sufficient data exist. We analyze Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations, focusing on a ten-consecutive-orbit
sequence obtained in July 2010, to search for new very small satellites. To
maximize the search depth, we implement and validate a non-linear
shift-and-stack method. No additional satellites of Haumea are found, but by
implanting and recovering artificial sources, we characterize our sensitivity.
At distances between $\sim$10,000 km and $\sim$350,000 km from Haumea,
satellites with radii as small as $\sim$10 km are ruled out, assuming an albedo
($p \simeq 0.7$) similar to Haumea. We also rule out satellites larger than
$\gtrsim$40 km in most of the Hill sphere using other HST data. This search
method rules out objects similar in size to the small moons of Pluto. By
developing clear criteria for determining the number of non-linear rates to
use, we find that far fewer shift rates are required ($\sim$35) than might be
expected. The non-linear shift-and-stack method to discover satellites (and
other moving transients) is tractable, particularly in the regime where
non-linear motion begins to manifest itself.

Instead, the background geometry is conjectured to arise as an effective

imposed by the background statistics of the system. Namely, we suggest that
quantum reference states on an extended observable algebra, the free algebra
generated by the observables, may give rise to effective spacetime structures.
Accordingly, perturbations of the reference state lead to perturbations of the
induced effective spacetime geometry. We initiate the study of these
perturbations, and their relation to gravitational phenomena.

coupling to gravity is described by the nonlinear second-order differential
equations for two metric functions and the scalaron depending on the `time'
parameter. The equations depend on the scalaron potential and on the arbitrary
gauge function that describes time parameterizations. This dynamical system can
be integrated for flat, isotropic models with very special potentials. But,
somewhat unexpectedly, replacing the `time' variable by one of the metric
functions allows us to completely integrate the general spherical theory in any
gauge and with apparently arbitrary potentials. The main restrictions on the
potential arise from positivity of the derived analytic expressions for the
solutions, which are essentially the squared canonical momenta. An interesting
consequence is emerging of classically forbidden regions for these analytic
solutions. It is also shown that in this rather general model the inflationary
solutions can be identified, explicitly derived, and compared to the standard
approximate expressions. This approach can be applied to intrinsically
anisotropic models with a massive vector field (`vecton') as well as to some

Boolean data. On large datasets, an exact similarity computation is often
infeasible for all item pairs both due to time and space constraints, giving
rise to faster approximate methods. The algorithm of choice used to quickly
compute the Jaccard index $\frac{\vert A \cap B \vert}{\vert A\cup B\vert}$ of
two item sets $A$ and $B$ is usually a form of min-hashing. Most min-hashing
schemes are maintainable in data streams processing only additions, but none
are known to work when facing item-wise deletions. In this paper, we
investigate scalable approximation algorithms for rational set similarities, a
broad class of similarity measures including Jaccard. Motivated by a result of
Chierichetti and Kumar [J. ACM 2015] who showed any rational set similarity $S$
admits a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme if and only if the
corresponding distance $1-S$ is a metric, we can show that there exists a space
efficient summary maintaining a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$ multiplicative
approximation to $1-S$ in dynamic data streams. This in turn also yields a
$\varepsilon$ additive approximation of the similarity. The existence of these
approximations hints at, but does not directly imply a LSH scheme in dynamic
data streams. Our second and main contribution now lies in the design of such a
LSH scheme maintainable in dynamic data streams. The scheme is space efficient,
easy to implement and to the best of our knowledge the first of its kind able
to process deletions.

Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope and X-ray limits from the X-Ray Telescope on
Swift and imaging polarimetry and ultraviolet/optical spectroscopy with the
Hubble Space Telescope of ASASSN-15lh. It has been classified as a
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN I) more luminous than any other
supernova observed. ASASSN-15lh is not detected in the X-rays in individual or
coadded observations. From the polarimetry we determine that the explosion was
only mildly asymmetric. We find the flux of ASASSN-15lh to increase strongly
into the ultraviolet, with a ultraviolet luminosity a hundred times greater
than the hydrogen-rich, ultraviolet-bright SLSN II SN 2008es. We find objects
as bright as ASASSN-15lh are easily detectable beyond redshifts of ~4 with the
single-visit depths planned for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Deep
near-infrared surveys could detect such objects past a redshift of ~20 enabling
a probe of the earliest star formation. A late rebrightening -- most prominent
at shorter wavelengths -- is seen about two months after the peak brightness,
which is itself as bright as a superluminous supernova. The ultraviolet spectra
during the rebrightening are dominated by the continuum without the broad
absorption or emission lines seen in SLSNe or tidal disruption events and the
early optical spectra of ASASSN-15lh. Our spectra show no strong hydrogen
emission, showing only LyA absorption near the redshift previously found by
optical absorption lines of the presumed host. The properties of ASASSN-15lh
are extreme when compared to either SLSNe or tidal disruption events.

to measure the dimensionality of the set response vectors, i.e. the dimension
of the space of linear combinations of neural population activity patterns in
response to specific task conditions. RS-fMRI measures the overlap between
response vectors even in brain areas displaying no discernible average
differential BOLD signal. We show how this property can be used to estimate the
neural response dimensionality in areas lacking macroscopic spatial patterning.
The importance of dimensionality derives from how it relates to a neural
circuit's functionality. As we show, the dimensionality of the response vectors
is predicted to be high in areas involved in multi-stream integration, while it
is low in areas where inputs from independent sources do not interact or merely
overlap linearly. Our method can be used to identify and functionally
characterize cortical circuits that integrate multiple independent information

self-consistent closure of the moment equations is presented that leads to a
continuity equation for the particle density and a Navier-Stokes-like equation
for the momentum density. Expressions for all transport coefficients in these
macroscopic equations are given explicitly in terms of microscopic parameters
of the model. The transport coefficients depend on specific angular integrals
which are evaluated asymptotically in the limit of infinitely many collision

exhibit amplitude modulation caused by beating of close-frequency pulsation
modes; those that exhibit pure amplitude modulation (with no associated phase
variation); those that exhibit phase modulation caused by binarity; and those
that exhibit amplitude modulation caused by nonlinearity. Using models and
examples of individual stars, we demonstrate that observations of the changes

different scenarios. We find that 603 $\delta$ Sct stars (61.3 per cent)

IRS1, using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). This paper presents a
joint analysis of the 1.37 mm continuum emission and the line intensity of 15
molecular species. Assuming local thermal equilibrium, we derived molecular
column densities and molecular abundances for each internal gas substructure
which is spatially resolved. These derived quantities are compared with a suite
of 1-D gas-grain models.
  NGC7538S is resolved into at least three dense gas condensations. Despite the
comparable continuum intensity of these condensations, their differing
molecular line emission is suggestive of an overall chemical evolutionary trend
from the northeast to the southeast. Since these condensations are embedded
within the same parent gas core, their differing chemical properties are the
most likely due to the different warm-up histories, rather than the different
dynamic timescales. Despite remaining spatially unresolved, in IRS1 we detect
abundant complex organic molecules, indicating that IRS1 is the most chemically
evolved hot molecular core presented here. We observe a continuum that is
dominated by absorption features with at least three strong emission lines,
potentially from $\rm CH_3OH$. The $\rm CH_3OH$ lines which are purely in
emission have higher excitation than the ones showing purely absorption.
Potential reasons for that difference are discussed.
  This is the first comprehensive comparison of observations of the high-mass
cores NGC7538S and IRS1 and a chemical model. We have found that different
chemical evolutionary stages can coexist in the same natal gas core. Our
achievement illustrates the strength of chemical analysis for understanding
HMSFRs.

However, like most of the radial velocity ones, these surveys generally focus
on single stars, hence binaries and higher-order multiples have not been
studied to the same level of scrutiny. This motivated the SPOTS (Search for
Planets Orbiting Two Stars) survey, which is an ongoing direct imaging study of
a large sample of close binaries, started with VLT/NACO and now continuing with
VLT/SPHERE. To complement this survey, we have identified the close binary
targets in 24 published direct imaging surveys. Here we present our statistical
analysis of this combined body of data. We analysed a sample of 117 tight
binary systems, using a combined Monte Carlo and Bayesian approach to derive
the expected values of the frequency of companions, for different values of the
companion's semi-major axis. Our analysis suggest that the frequency of
sub-stellar companions in wide orbit is moderately low ($\lesssim $13% with a
best value of 6% at 95% confidence level) and not significantly different
between single stars and tight binaries. One implication of this result is that
the very high frequency of circumbinary planets in wide orbits around
post-common envelope binaries, implied by eclipse timing (up to 90% according
to Zorotovic & Schreiber 2013), can not be uniquely due to planets formed
before the common-envelope phase (first generation planets), supporting instead
the second generation planet formation or a non-Keplerian origin of the timing
variations.

predicts there should be more than 10 subhaloes with velocity larger than
25km/s. Those massive subhaloes with $25km/s<V_{max}<55km/s$ should not have
failed to form stars. The TBTF problem severely challenges the CDM model. Most
efforts are seeking the effects of baryonic feedback, decreasing the mass of
the Milky Way, changing the properties of dark matter, so as to assign the
observed low-velocity satellites into the massive subhaloes found in
simulations. However, the TBTF problem can be avoided if the MW have not
accreted subhaloes with velocity between $25km/s<V_{max}<55km/s$ although the
probability of such a gap is lower as $\sim 1\%$ and can not be tested against
observations. In this work we study the gap in stellar mass of satellite
galaxies using the SDSS group catalogue and a semi-analytical model. We find
that there are 1-2\% of galaxy groups with a large gap in the stellar mass of
their satellites. These 'big gap' groups have accreted less massive subhaloes
in their formation history and naturally display a gap between their satellite
galaxies. If extrapolating our results to the Milky Way is appropriate, we
conclude that it is very likely that our Milky Way has not accreted enough
massive subhaloes to host those low-velocity satellites, and the TBTF problem
is naturally avoided.

investigate this variability, we construct a model incorporating both the
standard disk-corona continuum and relativistic reflection from the accretion
disk, based on prior NuSTAR work on Cygnus X-1, and apply this model to each
epoch independently. We find excellent consistency for the black hole spin, and
the iron abundance of the accretion disk, which are expected to remain constant
on observational timescales. In particular, we confirm that Cygnus X-1 hosts a
rapidly rotating black hole, 0.93<a*<0.96, in broad agreement with the majority
of prior studies of the relativistic disk reflection and constraints on the
spin obtained through studies of the thermal accretion disk continuum. Our work
also confirms the apparent misalignment between the inner disk and the orbital
plane of the binary system reported previously, finding the magnitude of this
warp to be ~10-15deg. This level of misalignment does not significantly change
(and may even improve) the agreement between our reflection results and the
thermal continuum results regarding the black hole spin. The spectral
variability observed by NuSTAR is dominated by the primary continuum, implying
variability in the temperature of the scattering electron plasma. Finally, we
consistently observe absorption from ionized iron at ~6.7 keV, which varies in
strength as a function of orbital phase in a manner consistent with the
absorbing material being an ionized phase of the focused stellar wind from the

upward fluctuations of the surface brightness for studying the internal stellar
kinematics and metallicities of low surface brightness galaxies and streams
beyond the Local Group. The distance to these systems makes them unsuitable for
targeting individual red giant branch (RGB) stars (tip of RGB at
$I\gtrsim24$~mag) and their surface brightness is too low ($\mu_r\gtrsim
25$~mag~arcsec$^{-2}$) for integrated light spectroscopic measurements. This
technique overcomes these two problems by targeting individual objects that are
brighter than the tip of the RGB. We apply this technique to the star-forming
dwarf galaxy NGC 4449 and its stellar stream. We use Keck/DEIMOS data to
measure the line-of-sight radial velocity out to $\sim7$~kpc in the East side
of the galaxy and $\sim8$~kpc along the stream. We find that the two systems
are likely gravitationally bound to each other and have heliocentric radial
velocities of $227.3\pm10.7$~km/s and $225.8\pm16.0$~km/s, respectively.
Neither the stream nor the near half of the galaxy shows a significant velocity
gradient. We estimate the stellar metallicity of the stream based on the
equivalent width of its Calcium triplet lines and find [Fe/H]~$=-1.37\pm0.41$,
which is consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relation for Local Group
dwarf galaxies. Whether the stream's progenitor was moderately or severely
stripped cannot be constrained with this metallicity uncertainty. We
demonstrate that this new technique can be used to measure the kinematics and
(possibly) the metallicity of the numerous faint satellites and stellar streams
in the halos of nearby ($\sim 4$~Mpc) galaxies.

formalism. We show that the BCS mean-field theory implemented with the slave
spin formalism naturally predicts two distinct gaps which are the pairing gap
of the spinons $\Delta_f$ and the Cooper pairing gap of the electrons
$\Delta_{SC} = Z\Delta_f$, where $Z$ is the quasiparticle weight. Furthermore,
we find that the nature of the superconducting state depends crucially on the
interaction providing the pairing mechanism. For spin interactions, the
bandwidth of the spinon hopping term is renormalized by $Z$ but the its pairing
term is not. As a result, if $U$ exceeds the critical value for the Mott
insulating state at half-filling, $Z$ develops a strong doping dependence,
leading to a doping-driven crossover from strong to weak pairing states. In the
strong pairing state, while $\Delta_f$ is enhanced as $x\to 0$,
$\Delta_{SC}\sim x$ due to the renormalization of $Z$. In the weak pairing
state, $Z$ does not change with $x$ significantly. Therefore, $\Delta_{SC}$ is
mainly controlled by $\Delta_f$, and both of them go to zero at larger doping.
The crossover from strong to weak pairing states is well captured by the slave
spin formalism within reasonable range of parameters just at the mean-field
level, indicating the slave spin formalism is a powerful tool to study
correlated materials. For charge interactions, we find that the bandwidth of
the spinon hopping term and its pairing term are renormalized by $Z$ and $Z^2$
respectively. Consequently, both $\Delta_f$ and $\Delta_{SC}$ are suppressed at
small $x$ in large U, and no crossover will occur. The implication of our
results for the superconducting states in correlated materials will be
discussed.

$\xi_\mathrm{ion}$, and the time-evolution of the UV limiting magnitude

$f_\mathrm{esc}(z)$ evolves significantly with redshift, yielding
$f_\mathrm{esc} \sim 0.2, 0.3, 0.6$ at $z=6,9,12$, respectively. However, a

of keeping only the leading order term in the series expansions. Due to
monodromies vacua are located at a given sheet in the z-plane. A dS vacuum

network around large, nearly empty regions known as cosmic voids. Cosmic voids
are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information
about the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an
increasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void
studies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position
errors of $\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In
this paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,
validate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$
redMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)
data. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding
voids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the
line-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,
the number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic
and photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,
and indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and
larger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric
voids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the
algorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.8$, we identify 87
voids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/$h$, and carry out a
stacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of $4.4\sigma$, the
lensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field
and hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics
in the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the
viability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.

the debris disk around HD 32297 in H-band, as well as the first polarimetric
images for this system in polarized differential imaging (PDI) mode with
Subaru/HICIAO. In ADI, we detect the nearly edge-on disk at >5sigma levels from
~0.45 arcsec to ~1.7 arcsec (50-192 AU) from the star and recover the spine
deviation from the midplane already found in previous works. We also find for
the first time imaging and surface brightness (SB) indications for the presence
of a gapped structure on both sides of the disk at distances of ~0.75 arcsec
(NE side) and ~0.65 arcsec (SW side). Global forward-modelling work delivers a
best-fit model disk and well-fitting parameter intervals that essentially match
previous results, with high-forward scattering grains and a ring located at 110
AU. However, this single ring model cannot account for the gapped structure
seen in our SB profiles. We create simple double ring models and achieve a
satisfactory fit with two rings located at 60 and 95 AU, respectively,
low-forward scattering grains and very sharp inner slopes. In polarized light
we retrieve the disk extending from ~0.25-1.6 arcsec, although the central
region is quite noisy and high S/N are only found in the range ~0.75-1.2
arcsec. The disk is polarized in the azimuthal direction, as expected, and the
departure from the midplane is also clearly observed. Evidence for a gapped
scenario is not found in the PDI data. We obtain a linear polarization degree
of the grains that increases from ~10% at 0.55 arcsec to ~25% at 1.6 arcsec.
The maximum is found at scattering angles of ~90degrees, either from the main
components of the disk or from dust grains blown out to larger radii.

circumstellar material that is observed by Kepler for many young stars in the
Upper Sco and $\rho$ Oph star formation regions. These young, low-mass ""dipper""
stars are known to have low accretion rates and primarily host moderately
evolved dusty circumstellar disks. Young low mass stars often exhibit rotating
star spots that cause quasi-periodic photometric variations. We found no
evidence for periods associated with the dips that are different from the star
spot rotation period in spectrograms constructed from the light curves. The
material causing the dips in most of these light curves must be approximately
corotating with the star. We find that disk temperatures computed at the disk
corotation radius are cool enough that dust should not sublime. Crude estimates
for stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates are consistent with
magnetospheric truncation near the corotation radius. Magnetospheric truncation
models can explain why the dips are associated with material near corotation
and how dusty material is lifted out of the midplane to obscure the star which
would account for the large fraction of young low mass stars that are dippers.
We propose that variations in disk orientation angle, stellar magnetic field
dipole tilt axis, and disk accretion rate are underlying parameters accounting
for differences in the dipper light curves.

Here we show using a computational model that by amplifying local strain cues,
active cell contractility can facilitate and accelerate the reorientation of
single cells to static strains. At the collective cell level, the model
simulations show that active cell contractility can facilitate the formation of
strings along the orientation of stretch. The computational model is based on a
hybrid cellular Potts and finite-element simulation framework describing a
mechanical cell-substrate feedback, where: 1) cells apply forces on the ECM,
such that 2) local strains are generated in the ECM, and 3) cells
preferentially extend protrusions along the strain orientation. In accordance
with experimental observations, simulated cells align and form string-like
structures parallel to static uniaxial stretch. Our model simulations predict
that the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch and the strength of the contractile
forces regulate a gradual transition between string-like patterns and vascular
network-like patterns. Our simulations also suggest that at high population
densities, less cell cohesion promotes string formation.

(WR) stars outside the Local Group is challenging task due to the difficulties
in detecting their faint spectral features. In this exploratory work, we
develop a methodology to perform an automated search of WR signatures through a
pixel-by-pixel analysis of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data belonging to
the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey, CALIFA. This technique
allowed us to build the first catalogue of Wolf-Rayet rich regions with
spatially-resolved information, allowing to study the properties of these
complexes in a 2D context. The detection technique is based on the
identification of the blue WR bump (around He II 4686 {\AA}, mainly associated
to nitrogen-rich WR stars, WN) and the red WR bump (around C IV 5808 {\AA} and
associated to carbon-rich WR stars, WC) using a pixel-by-pixel analysis. We
identified 44 WR-rich regions with blue bumps distributed in 25 galaxies of a
total of 558. The red WR bump was identified only in 5 of those regions. We
found that the majority of the galaxies hosting WR populations in our sample
are involved in some kind of interaction process. Half of the host galaxies
share some properties with gamma-ray burst (GRB) hosts where WR stars, as
potential candidates to being the progenitors of GRBs, are found. We also
compared the WR properties derived from the CALIFA data with stellar population
synthesis models, and confirm that simple star models are generally not able to
reproduce the observations. We conclude that other effects, such as the binary
star channel (which could extend the WR phase up to 10 Myr), fast rotation or
other physical processes that causes the loss of observed Lyman continuum
photons, are very likely affecting the derived WR properties, and hence should
be considered when modelling the evolution of massive stars.

However, permutation tests can be computationally intensive. We propose both an
asymptotic approximation and a resampling algorithm for quickly estimating
small permutation p-values (e.g. $<10^{-6}$) for the difference and ratio of
means in two-sample tests. Our methods are based on the distribution of test
statistics within and across partitions of the permutations, which we define.
In this article, we present our methods and demonstrate their use through
simulations and an application to cancer genomic data. Through simulations, we
find that our resampling algorithm is more computationally efficient than
another leading alternative, particularly for extremely small p-values (e.g.
$<10^{-30}$). Through application to cancer genomic data, we find that our
methods can successfully identify up- and down-regulated genes. While we focus
on the difference and ratio of means, we speculate that our approaches may work

combines a circumstellar scattering component with interstellar dust where
scattering can account for over half of the polarization at $4000$ \AA. Upon

allows us to say when such algorithms can and cannot generalize certain

Identity-based rules have proven to be difficult or impossible for certain
types of learning algorithms to acquire from limited datasets. This is in
contrast to human behaviour on similar tasks. Here we provide a framework for
rigorously establishing which learning algorithms will fail at generalizing
identity-based rules to novel stimuli. We use this framework to show that such
algorithms are unable to generalize identity-based rules to novel inputs unless
trained on virtually all possible inputs. We demonstrate these results

  To this purpose, we consider a parametrized family of Lagrangians for the

In the Maxwell case, the unique spherically symmetric black hole solutions are
described by the Reissner-Nordstr\""om family and in this case it is well-known
that the quasi-normal spectra in the even- and odd-parity sectors are identical
to each other. However, when moving away from the Maxwell case, we obtain

and answer their main open question. Immorlica et al. considered classic
optimization problems in terms of competition and introduced a general class of

where two players are competing for a user's satisfaction. In their main and
most natural game, the ranking duel, a user requests a webpage by submitting a
query and players output an ordering over all possible webpages based on the
submitted query. The user tends to choose the ordering which displays her
requested webpage in a higher rank. The goal of both players is to maximize the
probability that her ordering beats that of her opponent and gets the user's
attention. Immorlica et al. show this game directs both players to provide
suboptimal search results. However, they leave the following as their main open
question: ""does competition between algorithms improve or degrade expected
performance?"" In this paper, we resolve this question for the ranking duel and
a more general class of dueling games.
  More precisely, we study the quality of orderings in a competition between
two players. This game is a zero-sum game, and thus any Nash equilibrium of the
game can be described by minimax strategies. Let the value of the user for an
ordering be a function of the position of her requested item in the
corresponding ordering, and the social welfare for an ordering be the expected
value of the corresponding ordering for the user. We propose the price of
competition which is the ratio of the social welfare for the worst minimax
strategy to the social welfare obtained by a social planner. We use this
criterion for analyzing the quality of orderings in the ranking duel. We prove
the quality of minimax results is surprisingly close to that of the optimum
solution.

can come about by re-acceleration of electrons in the CME shock environment. We
describe under what conditions such a hardening can be achieved. Using this

that we can describe the similar dichotomy that exists between the so called

of similar masses rekindled suggestions that primordial BHs (PBHs) make up the
dark matter (DM). If so, PBHs would add a Poissonian isocurvature density
fluctuation component to the inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations.
For LIGO's BH parameters, this extra component would dominate the small-scale
power responsible for collapse of early DM halos at z>10, where first luminous
sources formed. We quantify the resultant increase in high-z abundances of
collapsed halos that are suitable for producing the first generation of stars
and luminous sources. The significantly increased abundance of the early halos
would naturally explain the observed source-subtracted near-IR cosmic infrared
background (CIB) fluctuations, which cannot be accounted for by known galaxy
populations. For LIGO's BH parameters this increase is such that the observed
CIB fluctuation levels at 2 to 5 micron can be produced if only a tiny fraction
of baryons in the collapsed DM halos forms luminous sources. Gas accretion onto
these PBHs in collapsed halos, where first stars should also form, would
straightforwardly account for the observed high coherence between the CIB and
unresolved cosmic X-ray background in soft X-rays. We discuss modifications
possibly required in the processes of first star formation if LIGO-type BHs
indeed make up the bulk or all of DM. The arguments are valid only if the PBHs
make up all, or at least most, of DM, but at the same time the mechanism
appears inevitable if DM is made of PBHs.

for open addressing hash tables, and a recurrence equation was found for the
distribution of its search cost. Although this recurrence could not be solved
analytically, it allowed for numerical computations that, remarkably, suggested
that the variance of the search cost approached a value of $1.883$ when the
table was full. Furthermore, by using a non-standard mean-centered search
algorithm, this would imply that searches could be performed in expected
constant time even in a full table.
  In spite of the time elapsed since these observations were made, no progress
has been made in proving them. In this paper we introduce a technique to work
around the intractability of the recurrence equation by solving instead an
associated differential equation. While this does not provide an exact
solution, it is sufficiently powerful to prove a bound for the variance, and
thus obtain a proof that the variance of Robin Hood is bounded by a small
constant for load factors arbitrarily close to 1. As a corollary, this proves
that the mean-centered search algorithm runs in expected constant time.
  We also use this technique to study the performance of Robin Hood hash tables
under a long sequence of insertions and deletions, where deletions are
implemented by marking elements as deleted. We prove that, in this case, the
variance is bounded by $1/(1-\alpha)+O(1)$, where $\alpha$ is the load factor.
  To model the behavior of these hash tables, we use a unified approach that
can be applied also to study the First-Come-First-Served and
Last-Come-First-Served collision resolution disciplines, both with and without

against gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show
that cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed
flexibility near their posterior and anterior ends. The flexibility in these
regions allows an interaction between the fluid drag and bending resistance: an
elastohydrodynamic coupling, to naturally break time-reversal symmetry and
enable locomotion at small length-scales. We present a theoretical model, a
'T-swimmer', which captures the key swimming phenotype of cercariae. We further
validate our results experimentally through a macro-scale robotic realization
of the 'T-swimmer', explaining the unique forked-tail geometry of cercariae.
Finally, we find that cercariae maintain the flexibility at their posterior and
anterior ends at an optimal regime for efficient swimming, as predicted by our
theoretical model. We anticipate that our work sets the ground for linking the
swimming of S. mansoni cercariae to disease transmission and enables
explorations of novel strategies for Schistosomiasis prevention.

  CSI","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1602.03328",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of the interference alignment for the
$K$-user SISO interference channel (IC) with blind channel state information
(CSI) at transmitters. Our achievement in contrast to the traditional $K-$user
interference alignment (IA) scheme has more practical notions. In this case,
every receiver is equipped with one reconfigurable antenna which tries to place
its desired signal in a subspace which is linearly independent of interference
signals. We show that if the channel values are known to the receivers only,
the sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the linear blind IA (BIA) with
reconfigurable antenna is $\frac{Kr}{r^2-r+K}$, where $r = \left
\lceil{\frac{\sqrt{1+4K}-1}{2}} \right \rceil$. The result indicates that the
optimum sum DoF for the $K-$user IC is to achieve the sum DoF of $\lim_{K
\rightarrow \infty} {\frac{Kr}{r^2-r+K}}=\frac{\sqrt{K}}{2}$ for an
asymptotically large interference network. Thus, the DoF of the $K$-user IC
using reconfigurable antenna grows sublinearly with the number of the users,
whereas it grows linearly in the case where transmitters access to the CSI. In
addition, we propose both achievability and converse proof so as to show that
this is the sum DoF of linear BIA with the reconfigurable antenna.

Magnetic Imager observations disclose that one footpoint of the MFRs originates
in the penumbra or penumbra edge with a stronger magnetic field, while the
other in the moss region with a weaker magnetic field. The significant
deviation of the axis of the MFRs from the main polarity inversion lines and
associated filaments suggests that the MFRs have ascended to a high altitude,
thus being distinguishable from the source sigmoidal ARs. The more interesting
thing is that, with the eruption of the MFRs, the average inclination angle and
direct current at the footpoints with stronger magnetic field tend to decrease,
which is suggestive of a straightening and untwisting of the magnetic field in
the MFR legs. Moreover, the associated flare ribbons also display an
interesting evolution. They initially appear as sporadical brightenings at the
two footpoints of and in the regions below the MFRs and then quickly extend to
two slender sheared J-shaped ribbons with the two hooks corresponding to the
two ends of the MFRs. Finally, the straight parts of the two ribbons separate
from each other, evolving into two widened parallel ones. These features mostly
conforms to and supports the recently proposed three-dimensional standard

be driven into a Weyl semimetal by the symmetry breaking or a topological
insulator by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling. Here we report the temperature
and gate voltage dependent magnetotransport properties of Cd3As2 nanoplates

two-carrier transport accompanied by a transition from n-type to p-type

explained by considering the temperature dependent spin-orbit coupling. The
magnetoresistance exhibits a large non-saturating value up to 2000% at high

messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week.
Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm

messages and to weekly reminders.
  Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the RL

experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared to

dynamics of the shadow system of an activator-inhibitor system known as a
Gierer-Meinhardt model. Shadow systems are intended to work as an intermediate
step between single equations and reaction-diffusion systems. In the case where
the inhibitor's response to the activator's growth is rather weak, then the
shadow system of the Gierer-Meinhardt model is reduced to a single though
non-local equation whose dynamics will be investigated. We mainly focus on the
derivation of blow-up results for this non-local equation which can be seen as
instability patterns of the shadow system. In particular, a {\it diffusion
driven instability (DDI)}, or {\it Turing instability}, in the neighbourhood of
a constant stationary solution, which it is destabilised via diffusion-driven
blow-up, is obtained. The latter actually indicates the formation of some
unstable patterns, whilst some stability results of global-in-time solutions
towards non-constant steady states guarantee the occurrence of some stable
patterns.

velocity-pressure formulation. The interface is described implicitly as the
zero level of a scalar function as it is common in level set based methods.
Hence, the interface is not aligned with the mesh. An unfitted finite element
discretization based on a Taylor-Hood velocity-pressure pair and an XFEM (or
CutFEM) modification is used for the approximation of the solution. This allows
for the accurate approximation of solutions which have strong or weak
discontinuities across interfaces which are not aligned with the mesh. To
arrive at a consistent, stable and accurate formulation we require several
additional techniques. First, a Nitsche-type formulation is used to implement
interface conditions in a weak sense. Secondly, we use the ghost penalty
stabilization to obtain an inf-sup stable variational formulation. Finally, for
the highly accurate approximation of the implicitly described geometry, we use
a combination of a piecewise linear interface reconstruction and a parametric
mapping of the underlying mesh. We introduce the method and discuss results of
numerical examples.

structure of an axi-symmetric, thermally driven wind originating from a disc in
which the density is a power law function of radius. Our scale-free solution is
strictly only valid in the absence of gravity or centrifugal support;
comparison with 2D hydrodynamic simulations of winds from Keplerian discs
however demonstrates that the scale-free solution is a good approximation also
in the outer regions of such discs, and can provide a reasonable description
even for launch radii well within the gravitational radius of the flow.
Although other authors have considered the flow properties along streamlines
whose geometry has been specified in advance, this is the first isothermal
calculation in which the flow geometry and variation of flow variables along
streamlines is determined self-consistently. It is found that the flow
trajectory is very sensitive to the power-law index of radial density variation
in the disc: the steeper the density gradient, the stronger is the curvature of
streamlines close to the flow base that is required in order to maintain
momentum balance perpendicular to the flow. Steeper disc density profiles are
also associated with more rapid acceleration, and a faster fall-off of density,
with height above the disc plane. The derivation of a set of simple governing
equations for the flow structure of thermal winds from the outer regions of

of aforementioned physical quantities, calculated at zero and nonzero
flexoelectric couplings, are very similar under zero applied pressure, but

physical quantities manifest conventional peculiarities that are characteristic
of the size-induced phase transitions. Namely, when the film thickness h
approaches the critical thickness hcr the transition to paraelectric phase
occurs. The combined effect of flexoelectric coupling and external pressure
induces polarizations at the film surfaces, which cause the electric built-in
field that destroys the thickness-induced phase transition to paraelectric
phase at h= hcr and induces the electret-like state with irreversible
spontaneous polarization at h<hcr. The built-in field leads to noticeable
increase of the average strain and elastic compliance under the film thickness
decrease below hcr that scales as 1/h at small thicknesses h. The changes of
the electron concentration by several orders of magnitude under positive or
negative pressures can lead to the occurrence of high- or low-conductivity

that GABs behave as ideal Dirac mass barriers for antidots smaller than the

are localized states on the periphery of the antidots due to successive
reflections on the antidot edge in the presence of a magnetic field. We show
that these states are robust against variations in lattice configuration and
antidot edge chirality. Moreover, we calculate the transmittance of disordered
GABs and find that magnetic edge states survive a moderate degree of disorder.
Due to the long phase-coherence length in graphene and the robustness of these

decoding. Computer simulation results for diversity order L = 2 and L = 4
confirm that the proposed low-density lattices attain the maximal diversity
order. The newly defined POL is used during this simulation to declare an
outage error without decoding, which drastically improves the decoding runtime.

respectively. The aim is to significantly increase the sample of known
Centaurus group members down to a fainter level of completeness, serving as a
basis for future studies of the 3D structure of the group. Following our
previous survey of 60 square degrees covering the M 83 subgroup, we extended
and completed our survey of the Centaurus group region by imaging another 500
square degrees area in the g and r bands with the wide-field Dark Energy Survey
Camera at the 4m Blanco telescope at CTIO. The limiting central surface
brightness reached for suspected Centaurus members is $\mu_r \approx 29$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$, corresponding to an absolute magnitude $M_r \approx -9.5$. The
images were enhanced using different filtering techniques. We found 41 new
dwarf galaxy candidates, which together with the previously discovered 16 dwarf
candidates in the M 83 subgroup amounts to almost a doubling of the number of
known galaxies in the Centaurus complex, if the candidates are confirmed. We
carried out surface photometry in g and r, and report the photometric
parameters derived therefrom, for all new candidates as well as previously
known members in the surveyed area. The photometric properties of the
candidates, when compared to those of LG dwarfs and previously known Centaurus
dwarfs, suggest membership in the Centaurus group. The sky distribution of the
new objects is generally following a common envelope around the Cen A and M 83

to choose an appropriate step size while running the algorithm. Since the
traditional line search technique does not apply for stochastic optimization
algorithms, the common practice in SGD is either to use a diminishing step
size, or to tune a fixed step size by hand, which can be time consuming in
practice. In this paper, we propose to use the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to
automatically compute step sizes for SGD and its variant: stochastic variance
reduced gradient (SVRG) method, which leads to two algorithms: SGD-BB and
SVRG-BB. We prove that SVRG-BB converges linearly for strongly convex objective

Option I proposed in [10], whose convergence result is missing in the

than SGD and SVRG with best-tuned step sizes, and is superior to some advanced

belongs to a certain class, is a very useful tool in data analytics and
learning, and finds applications in many domains such as sentiment analysis,
epidemiology, etc. For example, in sentiment analysis, the objective is often
not to estimate whether a specific text conveys a positive or a negative
sentiment, but rather estimate the overall distribution of positive and
negative sentiments during an event window. A popular way of performing the
above task, often dubbed quantification, is to use supervised learning to train
a prevalence estimator from labeled data.
  Contemporary literature cites several performance measures used to measure
the success of such prevalence estimators. In this paper we propose the first
online stochastic algorithms for directly optimizing these
quantification-specific performance measures. We also provide algorithms that
optimize hybrid performance measures that seek to balance quantification and
classification performance. Our algorithms present a significant advancement in
the theory of multivariate optimization and we show, by a rigorous theoretical
analysis, that they exhibit optimal convergence. We also report extensive
experiments on benchmark and real data sets which demonstrate that our methods
significantly outperform existing optimization techniques used for these

hydrogels dilate in the direction perpendicular to the shear plane. This
well-known behaviour known as the Poynting effect is characterized by a
positive normal stress. Surprisingly, biopolymer gels made of fibrous proteins
such as fibrin and collagen, as well as many biological tissues exhibit the
opposite effect, contracting under shear and displaying a negative normal
stress. Here we show that this anomalous behaviour originates from the open
network structure of biopolymer gels, which facilitates interstitial fluid flow
during shear. Using fibrin networks with a controllable pore size as a model
system, we show that the normal stress response to an applied shear is positive
at short times, but decreases to negative values with a characteristic time
scale set by pore size. Using a two-fluid model, we develop a quantitative
theory that unifies the opposite behaviours encountered in synthetic and
biopolymer gels. Synthetic polymer gels are impermeable to solvent flow and
thus effectively incompressible at typical experimental time scales, whereas
biopolymer gels are effectively compressible. Our findings suggest a new route
to tailor elastic instabilities such as the die-swell effect that often hamper
processing of polymer materials and furthermore show that poroelastic effects
play a much more important role in the mechanical properties of cells and
tissues than previously anticipated.

the vacuum energy of electromagnetic (EM) field. The full QED Hamiltonian
consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term $H_{\rm em}$, the pure
matter term $H_{\rm matt}$ and the interaction term $H_{\rm int}$. The $H_{\rm
em}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit
dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, $H_{\rm em}$ cannot generate any
forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum
energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the
forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy
generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that $H_{\rm em}$
attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of
motion and the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was
explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated
by $H_{\rm int}$.

causing an emerging research interest in device to device (D2D) communication:
the idea behind the D2D paradigm is to exploit the proper interface to directly
communicate with another user, without traversing any network infrastructure. A
first issue related to this paradigm consists in the need for a coordinator,
called controller, able to decide when activating a D2D connection is
appropriate and eventually able to manage such connection. In this view, the
paradigm of Software Defined Networking (SDN), can be exploited both to handle
the data flows among the devices and to interact directly with every device.
  This work is focused on a scenario where a device is selected by the SDN
controller, in order to become the master node of a WiFi-Direct network. The
remaining nodes, called clients, can exchange data with other nodes through the
master. The objective is to infer, through different Machine Learning
approaches, the number of nodes actively involved in receiving data, exploiting
only the information available at the client side and without modifying any
standard communication protocol. The information about the number of client
nodes is crucial when, e.g., a user desires a precise prediction of the

study of the surface of Haumea. We describe the physical characteristics of the
crystalline water ice present on the surface of Haumea for both regions, in and
out of the Dark Red Spot (DRS), and analyze the differences obtained for each
individual spectrum. The presence of crystalline water ice is confirmed over
more than half of the surface of Haumea. Our measurements of the average
spectral slope confirm the redder characteristic of the spot region. Detailed
analysis of the crystalline water-ice absorption bands do not show significant
differences between the DRS and the remaining part of the surface. We also
present the results of applying Hapke modeling to our data set. The best
spectral fit is obtained with a mixture of crystalline water ice (grain sizes
smaller than 60 micron) with a few percent of amorphous carbon. Improvements to
the fit are obtained by adding ~10% of amorphous water ice. Additionally, we
used the IFU-reconstructed images to measure the relative astrometric position

this time generally have a large number of nodes that are not fairly weighted
and connected to each other, translating a structural specification of the
data. Yet, even an algorithm for locating the average position in graphs is
lacking although this knowledge would be of primary interest for statistical or
representation problems. In this work, we develop a stochastic algorithm for
finding the Frechet mean of weighted undirected metric graphs. This method
relies on a noisy simulated annealing algorithm dealt with using
homogenization. We then illustrate our algorithm with two examples (subgraphs
of a social network and of a collaboration and citation network).

insulators for their applications in spintronics. However, topological surface
states are expected to give rise to only one type of spin polarization for a

manipulations. Here we report that in devices based on the bulk-insulating
topological insulator BiSbTeSe2, an unexpected switching of spin polarization
was observed upon changing the chemical potential. The spin polarization
expected from the topological surface states was detected in a heavily
electron-doped device, whereas the opposite polarization was reproducibly
observed in devices with low carrier densities. We propose that the latter type
of spin polarization stems from topologically-trivial two-dimensional states
with a large Rashba spin splitting, which are caused by a strong band bending
at the surface of BiSbTeSe2 beneath the ferromagnetic electrode used as a spin
detector. This finding paves the way for realizing the ""spin transistor""

minimize the localization uncertainty during a goal-reaching task. Thus, we
describe how to optimally incorporate the photometric information (i.e.,
texture) of the scene, in addition to the the geometric one, to compute the
uncertainty of vision-based localization during path planning. To avoid the
caveats of feature-based localization systems (i.e., dependence on feature type

compute the localization uncertainty directly from the intensity values of
every pixel in the image. We also describe how to compute trajectories online,
considering also scenarios with no prior knowledge about the map. The proposed
framework is general and can easily be adapted to different robotic platforms

experiments in both simulated and real-world environments using a

strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling, a moderate JT distortion and weak V-V

for such a distortion, we have avoided these complexities (various interactions
among spin, electronic, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom) by carrying out
spin unpolarized calculations. The calculated values of bulk moduli for
ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (ZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$), MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$) and

This problem arises, for example, in polymer escape if the polymer is long

polymer beads undergo diffusive motion back and forth over the barrier. We
present an efficient method for evaluating the correction factor by
constructing a sequence of hyperplanes starting at the transition state and
calculating the probability that the system advances from one hyperplane to
another towards the product. This is analogous to what is done in forward flux
sampling except that there the hyperplane sequence starts at the initial state.
The method is applied to the escape of polymers with up to 64 beads from a
potential well. For high temperature, the results are compared with direct
Langevin dynamics simulations as well as forward flux sampling and excellent
agreement between the three rate estimates is found. The use of a sequence of
hyperplanes in the evaluation of the recrossing correction speeds up the
calculation by an order of magnitude as compared with the traditional approach.
As the temperature is lowered, the direct Langevin dynamics simulations as well
as the forward flux simulations become computationally too demanding, while the
harmonic transition state theory estimate corrected for recrossings can be
calculated without significant increase in the computational effort.

(DDC) bounded by two parallel plates, with fluid properties similar to the
values of seawater. The DDC flow is driven by an unstable salinity difference
and stabilized at the same time by a temperature difference. For these
conditions the flow can be in the finger regime. We develop scaling laws for
three key response parameters of the system: The non-dimensional salinity flux
$Nu_S$ mainly depends on the salinity Rayleigh number $Ra_S$, which measures
the strength of the salinity difference, and exhibits a very weak dependence on
the density ratio $\Lambda$, which is the ratio of the buoyancy forces induced
by two scalar differences. The non-dimensional flow velocity $Re$ and the
non-dimensional heat flux $Nu_T$ are dependent on both $Ra_S$ and $\Lambda$.
However, the rescaled Reynolds number $Re\Lambda^{\alpha^{\rm eff}_u}$ and the
rescaled convective heat flux $(Nu_T-1)\Lambda^{\alpha^{\rm eff}_T}$ depend
only on $Ra_S$. The two exponents are dependent on the fluid properties and are
determined from the numerical results. Moreover, the behaviors of $Nu_S$ and
$Re\Lambda^{\alpha^{\rm eff}_u}$ agree with the predictions of the
Grossmann-Lohse theory which was originally developed for the
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard flow. The non-dimensional salt-finger width and the
thickness of the velocity boundary layers, after being rescaled by
$\Lambda^{\alpha^{\rm eff}_u/2}$, collapse and obey a similar power-law scaling
relation with $Ra_S$. When $Ra_S$ is large enough, salt fingers do not extend
from one plate to the other and horizontal zonal flows emerge in the bulk
region. We then show that the current scaling strategy can be successfully
applied to the experimental results of a heat-copper-ion system~(Hage and
Tilgner, Phys. Fluids, 22, 076603, 2010).

as Rieger-type periodicity, which usually occurs near maxima of sunspot cycles.
An early analysis showed that the periodicity appears only in some cycles, and
is absent in other cycles. But the appearance/absence during different cycles
has not been explained. We performed a wavelet analysis of sunspot data from
the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the Royal Observatory of Belgium during
cycles 14-24. We found that the Rieger-type periods occur in all cycles, but
they are cycle-dependent: shorter periods occur during stronger cycles. Our
analysis revealed a periodicity of 185-195 days during the weak cycles 14-15
and 24, and a periodicity of 155-165 days during the stronger cycles 16-23. We
derived the dispersion relation of the spherical harmonics of the magnetic
Rossby waves in the presence of differential rotation and a toroidal magnetic
field in the dynamo layer near the base of the convection zone. This showed
that the harmonic of fast Rossby waves with m=1 and n=4, where m (n) indicate
the toroidal (poloidal) wavenumbers, respectively, perfectly fit with the
observed periodicity. The variation of the toroidal field strength from weaker
to stronger cycles may lead to the different periods found in those cycles,
which explains the observed enigmatic feature of the Rieger-type periodicity.
Finally, we used the observed periodicity to estimate the dynamo field strength
during cycles 14-24. Our estimations suggest a field strength of 40 kG for the
stronger cycles, and 20 kG for the weaker cycles.

K\""ahlerian transverse structure, they use this fact only in a few very special
cases.
  The paper presents an approach to Sasakian manifolds on which the author gave
several lectures, most recently at the Workshop on almost hermitian and contact
geometry at the Banach Center in B\c{e}dlewo in October 2015 and at University
of the Basque Country in February 2016. The first lectures on the topic the
author gave at Universidad de Sevilla in October 1988 and then presented the
consequence for the geometry of Sasakian manifolds, in particular the
relationns between various curvatures and those of the transverse K\""ahler
manifold. The results were published in several sections of \cite{WO_S} as well
as in \cite{Wo_deb}. The most general theory of geometrical structures
""adapted"" to a foliation was presented in \cite{WO_T}, see also \cite{WO_S}.
The paper concentrates on cohomological properties of Sasakian manifolds and of
transversely holomorphic and K\""ahlerian foliations. These properties permit to
formulate obstructions to the existence of Sasakian structures on compact
manifolds. The presented results are due to the author as well as his former

through the Purcell effect. Both can provide large emission enhancements: the
cavity typically through long photon lifetimes (high $Q$), and the antenna
mostly through strong field enhancement (low mode volume $V$). In this work, we
demonstrate that a hybrid system, which combines a cavity and a dipolar
antenna, can achieve stronger emission enhancements than the cavity or antenna
alone. We show that such systems can be used as a versatile platform to tune
the bandwidth of enhancement to any desired value, while simultaneously
boosting emission enhancement. Our fully consistent analytical model allows to
identify the underlying mechanisms of boosted emission enhancement in hybrid
systems, which include radiation damping and constructive interference between
multiple-scattering paths. Additionally, we find excellent agreement between
strongly boosted enhancement spectra from our analytical model and from
finite-element simulations on a realistic cavity-antenna system. Finally, we
demonstrate that hybrid systems can simultaneously boost emission enhancement

position of an emitters far-field radiation pattern to infer its position to a
precision that is far below the diffraction limit. However, nanostructures
composed of high-dielectric materials such as noble metals can distort the
far-field radiation pattern. Nanoparticles also exhibit a more complex range of
distortions, because in addition to introducing a high dielectric surface, they
also act as efficient scatterers. Thus, the distortion effects of nanoparticles
in single-emitter microscopy remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate
that metallic nanoparticles can significantly distort the accuracy of
single-emitter imaging at distances exceeding 300 nm. We use a single quantum
dot to probe both the magnitude and the direction of the metallic
nanoparticle-induced imaging distortion and show that the diffraction spot of
the quantum dot can shift by more than 35 nm. The centroid position of the
emitter generally shifts away from the nanoparticle position, in contradiction
to the conventional wisdom that the nanoparticle is a scattering object that
will pull in the diffraction spot of the emitter towards its center. These
results suggest that dielectric distortion of the emission pattern dominates
over scattering. We also show that by monitoring the distortion of the quantum
dot diffraction spot we can obtain high-resolution spatial images of the
nanoparticle, providing a new method for performing highly precise,

lack of high-quality single crystals covering the entire K-doping range of the

a significant improvement in the precision with which neutrino oscillation

unique to all magnetisable detectors and constitutes a great advantage in
determining neutrino oscillation parameters using such detectors. Such a study

$A_V$ values makes the actual relationship highly uncertain. With the exception
of DX Cha, we find no evidence for hot, optically thick winds in our HAEBE
sample. All other objects showing clear doublet emission in C IV can be well
described by a two component (i.e., a single component for each doublet member)
or four component (i.e., two components for each doublet member) Gaussian
emission line fit. The morphologies and peak-flux velocities of these lines
suggest they are formed in weak, optically thin stellar winds and not in an
accretion flow, as is the case for the hot lines observed in CTTSs. The lack of
strong outflow signatures and lack of evidence for line formation in accretion
flows is consistent with the conclusion presented in our recent optical and He
I 10830 \AA\ studies that the immediate circumstellar environments of HAEBES,
in general, are not scaled-up analogs of the immediate environments around
CTTSs. The conclusions presented here for hot gas lines around HAEBES should be
verified with a larger sample of objects.

Orbifolds were defined by Satake, as V-manifolds, then studied by W. Thurston,

particular in the string theory, orbifolds have been drawing more and more
attention. In this paper we propose to show that the classical theory of
geometrical structures, easily translates itself to the context of orbifolds

factor, which is commonly associated with clustering, for wide ranges of the
tunable parameters that control interparticle interactions (e.g., Debye
screening length). Next, for approximately 100 different cluster phases at
various conditions (where aggregates range in size from six to sixty monomers),
we quantitatively relate the shape of the structure factor to physical
characteristics including intercluster distance and cluster size. We also test
two previously postulated criteria for identifying the emergence of clustered
phases that are based on IRO peak-height and -width, respectively. We find that
the criterion based on peak-width, which encodes the IRO thermal correlation
length, is more robust across a wide range of conditions and interaction
strengths but nonetheless approximate. Ultimately, we recommend a hybrid
heuristic drawing on both pre-peak height and width for positively identifying
the emergence of clustered states.

the weak-deflection limit (WDL) by studying primary caustics and primary
critical curves obtained for a Kerr black hole. We compare GYOTO results to
available analytical approximations and estimate GYOTO errors using an

null geodesics computed by GYOTO and the ray-tracing code named Geokerr.

different angles from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We have demonstrated that GYOTO
is accurate to a very high level, orders of magnitude better than the GRAVITY
requirements. GYOTO is also valid in weak- and strong-deflection regimes and
for very long integrations. At the astrometric precision that GRAVITY is aiming
for, lensing effects must always be taken into account when fitting stellar
orbits in the central parsec of the Galaxy.

probability measure, $G$ a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\frak g$,
$F_1:X\to X$ the time-one map of a measure-preserving flow, and $\phi\in

function $P_\phi M_\phi:X\to\frak g$, we show that it transforms in a natural
way under Lie group homomorphisms and under the relation of $C^1$-cohomology,
and we explain how it generalises previous definitions of degree of a cocycle.
For each finite-dimensional irreducible representation $\pi$ of $G$, and $\frak
g_\pi$ the Lie algebra of $\pi(G)$, we define in an analogous way the degree of
$\pi\circ\phi$ as a suitable function
$P_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi}:X\to\frak g_\pi$. If $F_1$ is uniquely
ergodic and the functions $\pi\circ\phi$ diagonal, or if $T_\phi$ is uniquely
ergodic, then the degree of $\phi$ reduces to a constant in $\frak g$ given by
an integral over $X$. As a by-product, we obtain that there is no uniquely
ergodic skew product $T_\phi$ with nonzero degree if $G$ is a connected
semisimple compact Lie group.
  Next, we show that $T_\phi$ is mixing in the orthocomplement of the kernel of
$P_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi}$, and under some additional assumptions we
show that $U_\phi$ has purely absolutely continuous spectrum in that
orthocomplement if $(iP_{\pi\circ\phi}M_{\pi\circ\phi})^2$ is strictly
positive. Summing up these results for each $\pi$, one obtains a global result
for the mixing and the absolutely continuous spectrum of $T_\phi$. As an
application, we present four explicit cases: when $G$ is a torus, $G=SU(2)$,
$G=SO(3,\mathbb R)$, and $G=U(2)$. In each case, the results we obtain are new,

  2. Exponential lower bounds for homogeneous depth-$4$ arithmetic circuits

  Our main motivation for this line of research comes from our observation that
strong enough functional lower bounds for even very special depth-$4$
arithmetic circuits for the Permanent imply a separation between ${\#}P$ and
$ACC$. Thus, improving the second result to get rid of the bounded individual

complexity. Besides, it is known from a recent result of Kumar and Saptharishi

functional lower bounds for homogeneous depth-$4$ circuits imply

nucleus is cooled by evaporating $\gamma$-ray, light particles (neutrons,
protons, $\alpha$ etc) in competition with the binary fission, in which the
structure effects (shell correction, fission barrier, particle separation
energy) contribute to the processes. The formation of residual nuclei is
evaluated via sequential emission of possible particles above the separation

only bare nuclear masses are considered. Nowadays, experimental accuracy
challenges the theoretical predictions of rotational and vibrational spectra

freedom feel the presence of the electrons via a single potential energy
surface, whereas the inertia of electrons is accounted for and the total mass
of the system is recovered. This constitutes a general framework for describing
the mass acquired by slow degrees of freedom due to the inertia of light,
bounded particles. We illustrate it with a model of proton transfer, where the

quasars have already been shown to occupy a small region of the available

that the observational dearth of FRI quasars is also related to their
connection to the most massive black hole growth due to both these FRIs high
redshifts and relative weakness. Our results also allow us to construct the AGN
luminosity function at high redshift, that agree with recent studies. In short,
we produce a connection between the unexplained paucity of a given family of

depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly
remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic
activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How
this type of intrinsi- cally generated fluctuations appears in more realistic
networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the
comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the
dynami- cal regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated
excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be
positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations
describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the
case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory
architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show
that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity
compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation,
intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing
rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks.
Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate
overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations,
for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound
imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These
results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks
receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that
signatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of
integrate-and-fire neurons.

explicitly build two-point quantum correlation functions, which capture the
specific, superior correlations of quantum systems at finite temperature, and
which are directly { accessible to experiments when correlating measurable
properties}. When non-vanishing, these correlation functions rule out a precise
form of separability of the equilibrium state. In particular, we show
numerically that quantum correlation functions generically exhibit a finite

length is completely disconnected from the correlation length of the system --

impurities or heavy polarons using a microscopic Hamiltonian with the full
many-body Coulomb interaction with the use of variational many-body formalism.
At zero temperature and high enough density the bosonic fluid is
superconducting, but when density decreases the Coulomb interaction will be
strongly over-screened and impurities or polarons begin to trap charge carriers
forming bound quasiparticle like clusters, which we call Coulomb bubbles or
clumps. These bubbles are embedded inside the superconductor and form nuclei of
a new insulating state- the local Charge Density Wave(CDW). The growth of a
bubble is terminated by the Coulomb force. The fluid contains two groups of
charge carriers associated with free and localized states. The insulating state
arises via a percolation of the insulating islands of bubbles, which cluster
and prevent the flow of the electrical supercurrent through the system.
  The picture is consistent with the Gorkov and Teitelbaum (GT) analysis of the
transport, Hall effect data and the ARPES spectra as well as with nanoscale
superstructures observed in Scanning Tunneling Microscope(STM) experiments. The
scenario of the clump formation may be also applicable to pnictides, where two
types of clumps may arise even at very high temperatures. The paper has been
published in the book ""Condensed Matter Theories"" volume 24.

canonic Hamiltonian $\widetilde{h}_c$ follows from dropping all the interaction
terms between free bosons with momentum $\hbar\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}$.
Bogoliubov Canonic Approximation (BCA) is a further manipulation, replacing the
number \emph{operator} $\widetilde{N}_{in}$ of free particles in
$\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, with the total number $N$ of bosons. BCA transforms
$\widetilde{h}_c$ into a different Hamiltonian
$H_{BCA}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}}\epsilon(k)B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}B_\mathbf{k}+const$,
where $B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}$ and $B_\mathbf{k}$ create/annihilate non
interacting pseudoparticles. The problem of the \emph{exact} eigenstates of the
truncated Hamiltonian is completely solved in the thermodynamic limit (TL) for
a special class of eigensolutions $|\:S,\:\mathbf{k}\:\rangle_{c}$, denoted as
\textquoteleft s-pseudobosons\textquoteright, with energies
$\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$ and \emph{zero} total momentum. Some preliminary results

$\eta\hbar\mathbf{k}$ ($\eta=\:1,\:2,\: \dots$). A comparison is done with
$H_{BCA}$ and with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory (GPT), showing that some
differences between exact and BCA/GPT results persist even in the TL. Finally,

the dissipation $\acute{a}$ \emph{la} Landau \cite{L}, could be significantly
different from the usual picture, based on BCA pseudobosons.

considered the most efficient method. Among these methods, continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both
stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of
overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of
redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or
misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact
Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion
in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have
been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor
acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir
University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and
chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with
radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet
analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then
evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show
that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in
feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO
exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact
wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and
crossover in PSO algorithm. SVM classifier with the extracted features in

25% of very low birth weight infants in NICU. The objective of this paper was
to determine if HRV, respiration and their relationships help to diagnose
infection in premature infants via non-invasive ways in NICU. Therefore, we
implement Mono-Channel (MC) and Bi-Channel (BC) Analysis in two groups: sepsis
(S) vs. non-sepsis (NS). Firstly, we studied RR series not only by linear
methods: time domain and frequency domain, but also by non-linear methods:
chaos theory and information theory. The results show that alpha Slow, alpha
Fast and Sample Entropy are significant parameters to distinguish S from NS.
Secondly, the question about the functional coupling of HRV and nasal
respiration is addressed. Local linear correlation coefficient r2t,f has been
explored, while non-linear regression coefficient h2 was calculated in two
directions. It is obvious that r2t,f within the third frequency band (0.2<f<0.4
Hz) and h2 in two directions were complementary approaches to diagnose sepsis.
Thirdly, feasibility study is carried out on the candidate parameters selected
from MC and BC respectively. We discovered that the proposed test based on
optimal fusion of 6 features shows good performance with the largest AUC and a
reduced probability of false alarm (PFA).
