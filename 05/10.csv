theoretically secure to malicious agents, provided that certain requirements on

stored information, in between times when it is being legitimately accessed, is
information theoretically secure both to adversaries who interact with the
database in the prescribed manner, as well as to adversaries who have installed
a virus that has access to the entire database and communicates with the

  The central idea behind our design is the construction of a ""re-randomizing

representation of the data must be made sufficiently often in comparison to the
amount of information that is being communicated from the database between
remappings and the amount of local memory in the database that a virus may
preserve during the remappings. The core of the proof of the security guarantee
is the following communication/data tradeoff for the problem of learning sparse
parities from uniformly random $n$-bit examples: any algorithm that can learn a
parity of size $k$ with probability at least $p$ and extracts at most $r$ bits
of information from each example, must see at least $p\cdot

from end to end as a function of source flux (or magnitude) and CCD position.
In addition, $\mathtt{ComEst}$ can also estimate the purity of the source
detection by comparing the catalog of the detected sources to the input
catalogs of the simulated sources. We run ComEst on the images from Blanco
Cosmology Survey (BCS) and compare the derived completeness as a function of

component of many evolutionary processes, yet the mechanisms by which it arises
and persists are still unclear. Among several theories, network reciprocity --
a model of inhomogeneous social interactions -- has been proposed as an
enabling mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. Existing
evolutionary models of this mechanism have tended to focus on highly
heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, hence typically assume preferential
attachment mechanisms, and consequently the prerequisite that individuals have
global network knowledge. Within an evolutionary game theoretic context, using
the weak prisoner's dilemma as a metaphor for cooperation, we present a minimal
model which describes network growth by chronological random addition of new
nodes, combined with regular attrition of less fit members of the population.
Specifically our model does not require that agents have access to global
information and does not assume scale-free network structure or a preferential
attachment mechanism. Further our model supports the emergence of cooperation
from initially non-cooperative populations. By reducing dependency on a number
of assumptions, this model offers broad applicability and as such may support
an explanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary
transitions, where few assumptions can be made.

members migrate from one to another. Specifically, we isolate the key elements
of the scenario where a minority of members from a cooperative network migrate
to a network populated by defectors. Using the public goods game to model
group-wise cooperation, we find that under certain circumstances, the concerted
actions of a trivial number of such migrants will catalyse widespread
behavioural change throughout an entire population. Such results support a
wider argument: that the general presence of some form of disruption
contributes to the emergence of cooperation in social networks, and
consequently that simpler models may encode a determinism that precludes the

system or corresponds to an ongoing merging process. Statistical tests were
applied to clusters members showing that both the composite system A3407 +
A3408 as well as each individual cluster have Gaussian velocity distribution. A
velocity gradient of $\sim 847\pm 114$ $\rm km\;s^{-1}$ was identified around
the principal axis of the projected distribution of galaxies, indicating that
the global field may be rotating. Applying the KMM algorithm to the
distribution of galaxies we found that the solution with two clusters is better
than the single unit solution at the 99\% c.l. This is consistent with the
X-ray distribution around this field, which shows no common X-ray halo
involving A3407 and A3408. We also estimated virial masses and applied a
two-body model to probe the dynamics of the pair. The more likely scenario is
that in which the pair is gravitationally bound and probably experiences a
collapse phase, with the cluster cores crossing in less than $\sim$1 $h^{-1}$
Gyr, a pre-merger scenario. The complex X-ray morphology, the gas temperature,

the spread of information in online social networks. Due to the constraints of
available time and cognitive resources, the ease of discovery strongly impacts
how people allocate their attention to social media content. As a consequence,
the position of information in an individual's social feed, as well as explicit
social signals about its popularity, determine whether it will be seen, and the
likelihood that it will be shared with followers. Accounting for these
cognitive limits simplifies mechanics of information diffusion in online social
networks and explains puzzling empirical observations: (i) information
generally fails to spread in social media and (ii) highly connected people are
less likely to re-share information. Studies of information diffusion on
different social media platforms reviewed here suggest that the interplay
between human cognitive limits and network structure differentiates the spread
of information from other social contagions, such as the spread of a virus
through a population.

integrator is sensitive to their choice.
  Cort\'es and Mart\'inez claim that choosing $L_d$ and $D_d$ in a consistent

performance of two different geometric integrators for the nonholonomic Suslov

to the ambient gas, or even remove the entire ambient gas, hence closing a
negative feedback cycle.

framework of Indyk and Motwani, which represents the asymptotically best
solutions to near neighbor problems in high dimensions. While traditional LSH
data structures have several parameters whose optimal values depend on the
distance distribution from $q$ to the points of $S$, our data structure is
parameter-free, except for the space usage, which is configurable by the user.
Nevertheless, its expected query time basically matches that of an LSH data
structure whose parameters have been *optimally chosen for the data and query*
in question under the given space constraints. In particular, our data
structure provides a smooth trade-off between hard queries (typically addressed
by standard LSH) and easy queries such as those where the number of points to
report is a constant fraction of $S$, or where almost all points in $S$ are far
away from the query point. In contrast, known data structures fix LSH
parameters based on certain parameters of the input alone.
  The algorithm has expected query time bounded by $O(t (n/t)^\rho)$, where $t$
is the number of points to report and $\rho\in (0,1)$ depends on the data
distribution and the strength of the LSH family used. We further present a
parameter-free way of using multi-probing, for LSH families that support it,
and show that for many such families this approach allows us to get expected
query time close to $O(n^\rho+t)$, which is the best we can hope to achieve
using LSH. The previously best running time in high dimensions was $\Omega(t
n^\rho)$. For many data distributions where the intrinsic dimensionality of the
point set close to $q$ is low, we can give improved upper bounds on the
expected query time.

(GW) from coalescent black holes by the aLIGO interferometers, we study the
propagation of GW in the {\sl D-material universe}, which we have recently
shown to be compatible with large-scale structure and inflationary
phenomenology. The medium of D-particles induces an effective mass for the
graviton, as a consequence of the formation of recoil-velocity field
condensates due to the underlying Born-Infeld dynamics. There is a competing
effect, due to a super-luminal refractive index, as a result of the
gravitational energy of D-particles acting as a dark matter component, with
which propagating gravitons interact. We examine conditions for the condensate
under which the latter effect is sub-leading. We argue that if quantum
fluctuations of the recoil velocity are relatively strong, which can happen in
the current era of the universe, then the condensate, and hence the induced
mass of the graviton, can be several orders of magnitude larger than the
magnitude of the cosmological constant today. Hence, we constrain the graviton
mass using aLIGO and pulsar timing observations (which give the most stringent
bounds at present). In such a sub-luminal graviton case, there is also a
gravitational Cherenkov effect for ordinary high energy cosmic matter, which is
further constrained by means of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray observations.
Assuming cosmic rays of extragalactic origin, the bounds on the quantum
condensate strength, based on the gravitational Cherenkov effect, are of the
same order as those from aLIGO measurements, in contrast to the case where a
galactic origin of the cosmic rays is assumed, in which case the corresponding
bounds are much weaker.

Earth. Planets in the close habitable zone of magnetically active M dwarfs may
experience more extreme space weather than at Earth, including frequent CME
impacts leading to atmospheric erosion and leaving the surface exposed to
extreme flare activity. Similar erosion may occur for hot Jupiters with close
orbits around solar-like stars. We have developed a model, Forecasting a CME's
Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT), which predicts a CME's deflection. We adapt
ForeCAT to simulate CME deflections for the mid-type M dwarf V374 Peg and hot
Jupiters with solar-type hosts. V374 Peg's strong magnetic fields can trap CMEs
at the M dwarfs's Astrospheric Current Sheet, the location of the minimum in
the background magnetic field. Solar-type CMEs behave similarly, but have much
smaller deflections and do not get trapped at the Astrospheric Current Sheet.
The probability of planetary impact decreases with increasing inclination of
the planetary orbit with respect to the Astrospheric Current Sheet - 0.5 to 5
CME impacts per day for M dwarf exoplanets, 0.05 to 0.5 CME impacts per day for
solar-type hot Jupiters. We determine the minimum planetary magnetic field
necessary to shield a planet's atmosphere from the CME impacts. M dwarf
exoplanets require values between tens and hundreds of Gauss. Hot Jupiters
around a solar-type star, however, require a more reasonable <30 G. These
values exceed the magnitude required to shield a planet from the stellar wind,
suggesting CMEs may be the key driver of atmospheric losses.

(free-free) and radio recombination line (RRL) emission of the compact HII
region NGC 7538 (Sharpless 158). We detect extended radio continuum and
hydrogen RRL emission beyond the photodissociation region (PDR) toward the
north and east, but a sharp decrease in emission toward the south and west.
This indicates that a non-uniform PDR morphology is affecting the amount of
radiation ""leaking"" through the PDR. The strongest carbon RRL emission is found
in the western PDR that appears to be dense. We compute a leaking fraction $f_R
= 15 \pm 5$ % of the radio continuum emission measured in the plane of the sky
which represents a lower limit when accounting for the three-dimensional
geometry of the region. We detect an average $^4\textrm{He}^+/\textrm{H}^+$
abundance ratio by number of $0.088 \pm 0.003$ inside the HII region and a
decrease in this ratio with increasing distance from the region beyond the PDR.
Using Herschel Space Observatory data, we show that small dust temperature
enhancements to the north and east of NGC 7538 coincide with extended radio
emission, but that the dust temperature enhancements are mostly contained
within a second PDR to the east. Unlike the giant HII region W43, the radiation
leaking from NGC 7538 seems to only affect the local ambient medium. This
suggests that giant HII regions may have a large effect in maintaining the
ionization of the interstellar medium.

  Locality-Sensitive Filtering","Accepted to SODA'17. See the paper for the complete abstract",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a framework for similarity search based on Locality-Sensitive
Filtering (LSF), generalizing the Indyk-Motwani (STOC 1998) Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) framework to support space-time tradeoffs. Given a family of
filters, defined as a distribution over pairs of subsets of space with certain
locality-sensitivity properties, we can solve the approximate near neighbor
problem in $d$-dimensional space for an $n$-point data set with query time
$dn^{\rho_q+o(1)}$, update time $dn^{\rho_u+o(1)}$, and space usage $dn + n^{1
+ \rho_u + o(1)}$. The space-time tradeoff is tied to the tradeoff between
query time and update time, controlled by the exponents $\rho_q, \rho_u$ that
are determined by the filter family. Locality-sensitive filtering was
introduced by Becker et al. (SODA 2016) together with a framework yielding a
single, balanced, tradeoff between query time and space, further relying on the
assumption of an efficient oracle for the filter evaluation algorithm. We
extend the LSF framework to support space-time tradeoffs and through a
combination of existing techniques we remove the oracle assumption.
  Building on a filter family for the unit sphere by Laarhoven (arXiv 2015) we
use a kernel embedding technique by Rahimi & Recht (NIPS 2007) to show a
solution to the $(r,cr)$-near neighbor problem in $\ell_s^d$-space for $0 < s
\leq 2$ with query and update exponents
$\rho_q=\frac{c^s(1+\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\lambda)^2}$ and
$\rho_u=\frac{c^s(1-\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\lambda)^2}$ where $\lambda\in[-1,1]$ is a
tradeoff parameter. This result improves upon the space-time tradeoff of
Kapralov (PODS 2015) and is shown to be optimal in the case of a balanced
tradeoff. Finally, we show a lower bound for the space-time tradeoff on the
unit sphere that matches Laarhoven's and our own upper bound in the case of
random data.

linear combinations of current and past observations can be used to accurately
predict future observations. For instance, each element of an observation
vector could correspond to a different node in a network, and the parameters of
an autoregressive model would correspond to the impact of the network structure
on the time series evolution. Often these models are used successfully in
practice to learn the structure of social, epidemiological, financial, or
biological neural networks. However, little is known about statistical
guarantees on estimates of such models in non-Gaussian settings. This paper
addresses the inference of the autoregressive parameters and associated network
structure within a generalized linear model framework that includes Poisson and
Bernoulli autoregressive processes. At the heart of this analysis is a
sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator. While
sparsity-regularization is well-studied in the statistics and machine learning
communities, those analysis methods cannot be applied to autoregressive
generalized linear models because of the correlations and potential
heteroscedasticity inherent in the observations. Sample complexity bounds are
derived using a combination of martingale concentration inequalities and modern
empirical process techniques for dependent random variables. These bounds,
which are supported by several simulation studies, characterize the impact of
various network parameters on estimator performance.

simultaneously generate multiple factorable states from different FWM processes

The effect of electron-doping by partially substituting Fe by Co is to form
resonances that couple with superconductivity, broaden and suppress low energy
($E\le 80$ meV) spin excitations compared with spin waves in undoped NaFeAs.
However, high energy ($E> 80$ meV) spin excitations are weakly Co-doping

$\chi^{\prime\prime}(\omega)$ of NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As reveals a total
fluctuating moment of 3.6 $\mu_B^2$/Fe and a small but systematic reduction
with electron doping. The presence of a large spin gap in the Co-overdoped

nesting is responsible for low-energy spin excitations. These results parallel
Ni-doping evolution of spin excitations in BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$, confirming

the size of the feature space for some standard textural features extracted
from the input dataset and then use the theory of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension
to show that hand-crafted feature extraction creates low-dimensional
representations which help in reducing the overall excess error rate. As a
corollary to this analysis, we derive for the first time upper bounds on the VC
dimension of Convolutional Neural Network as well as Dropout and Dropconnect
networks and the relation between excess error rate of Dropout and Dropconnect
networks. The concept of intrinsic dimension is used to validate the intuition
that texture-based datasets are inherently higher dimensional as compared to
handwritten digits or other object recognition datasets and hence more
difficult to be shattered by neural networks. We then derive the mean distance
from the centroid to the nearest and farthest sampling points in an
n-dimensional manifold and show that the Relative Contrast of the sample data
vanishes as dimensionality of the underlying vector space tends to infinity.

deterministic physical mechanism that may account for much of the variability

derive a coupling expression linking orbital and rotational motions that
produces an acceleration field varying with position and with time on and
within a subject body. The spatially and temporally varying accelerations may
interfere constructively or destructively with large-scale flows of geophysical
fluids that are established and maintained by other means. The hypothesis
predicts cycles of intensification and relaxation of circulatory flows of
atmospheres on seasonal and longer timescales that are largely independent of
solar forcing. The predictions of the hypothesis may be tested through
numerical modeling. Examples from investigations of the atmospheric circulation
of Mars are provided to illustrate qualitative features and quantitative
aspects of the mechanism proposed. We briefly discuss the implications and

the potential for dramatically-improved efficiency in the manipulation of
magnetic devices. However, in experiments performed to date, spin-orbit torques
have an important limitation -- the component of torque that can compensate
magnetic damping is required by symmetry to lie within the device plane. This
means that spin-orbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of
magnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with
in-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
that are needed for high-density applications. Here we show experimentally that
this state of affairs is not fundamental, but rather one can change the allowed
symmetries of spin-orbit torques in spin-source/ferromagnet bilayer devices by
using a spin source material with low crystalline symmetry. We use WTe2, a
transition-metal dichalcogenide whose surface crystal structure has only one
mirror plane and no two-fold rotational invariance. Consistent with these
symmetries, we generate an out-of-plane antidamping torque when current is
applied along a low-symmetry axis of WTe2/Permalloy bilayers, but not when
current is applied along a high-symmetry axis. Controlling S-O torques by
crystal symmetries in multilayer samples provides a new strategy for optimizing
future magnetic technologies.

cosmic baryon distribution. The kSZ signal is proportional to the integrated
free electron momentum rather than the electron pressure (which sources the
thermal SZ signal). Since velocities should be unbiased on large scales, the
kSZ signal is an unbiased tracer of the large-scale electron distribution, and
thus can be used to detect the ""missing baryon"" that evade most observational
techniques. While most current methods for kSZ extraction rely on the
availability of very accurate redshifts, we revisit a method that allows
measurements even in the absence of redshift information for individual
objects. It involves cross-correlating the square of an appropriately filtered
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature map with a projected density map
constructed from a sample of large-scale structure tracers. We show that this
method will achieve high signal-to-noise when applied to the next generation of
high-resolution CMB experiments, provided that component separation is
sufficiently effective at removing foreground contamination. Considering
statistical errors only, we forecast that this estimator can yield $S/N \approx
$ 3, 120 and over 150 for Planck, Advanced ACTPol, and hypothetical Stage-IV
CMB experiments, respectively, in combination with a galaxy catalog from WISE,
and about 20% larger $S/N$ for a galaxy catalog from the proposed SPHEREx
experiment. This work serves as a companion paper to the first kSZ measurement
with this method, where we used CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck
and WMAP data, together with galaxies from the WISE survey, to obtain a 3.8 -
4.5$\sigma$ detection of the kSZ$^2$ amplitude.

over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of
high-order adaptive optics systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with
specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing
strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in
high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results,
discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical
overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a
statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on
observations of 384 unique and single young ($\approx$5--300~Myr) stars
spanning stellar masses between 0.1--3.0~\Msun, the overall occurrence rate of
5--13~\Mjup \ companions at orbital distances of 30--300~AU is
0.6$^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$\% assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive
giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot
Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual
stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically-significant trend in planet
frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around 2.8$^{+3.7}_{-2.3}$\%
of BA stars, $<$4.1\% of FGK stars, and $<$3.9\% of M dwarfs. Looking forward,
extreme adaptive optics systems and the next generation of ground- and
space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection
limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics,
composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses

from chiral symmetry breaking in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. The chiral
symmetry is spontaneously broken by a charge density wave (CDW) order which
opens an energy gap and converts the Weyl semimetal into an axion insulator.
Indeed, the phase fluctuations of the CDW order parameter act as a dynamical
axion field $\theta({\vec{x}},t)$ and couples to electromagnetic field via
$\mathcal{L}_{\theta}=\frac{\theta(\vec{x},t)}{32\pi^2}
\epsilon^{\sigma\tau\nu\mu} F_{\sigma\tau} F_{\nu\mu}.$ Additionally, when the
axion insulator is coupled to the background geometry/strain fields via
torsional defects, i.e., screw dislocations, there is a novel interplay between
the crystal dislocations and dynamical axion strings (i.e., vortices of the CDW
order parameter). For example, the screw dislocation traps axial charge, and
there is a Berry phase accumulation when an axion string is braided with a
screw dislocation. In addition, a cubic coupling between the axial current and
the geometry fields is non-vanishing and indicates a Berry phase accumulation
during a particular three-loop braiding procedure where a dislocation loop is
braided with another dislocation and they are both threaded by an axion string.
We also observe a chiral magnetic effect induced by a screw dislocation density
in the absence of chemical potential imbalance between Weyl points and describe
an additional chiral geometric effect and a geometric Witten effect.

Most of the BCGs in this new sample lie in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.6$,

and semi-empirical models. As in other recent studies, tentative evidence
indicates that the stellar mass growth rate of BCGs may be slowing in the past

low-energy physics is encoded in Wilson lines along the directions of the
energetic particles inside the jets. This multi-Wilson-line structure is
present even for narrow-cone jets due to the relevance of small-angle soft
radiation. We discuss the renormalization-group equations satisfied by these
operators. Their solution resums all logarithmically enhanced contributions to
such processes, including non-global logarithms. Such logarithms arise in many
observables, in particular whenever hard phase-space constraints are imposed,
and are not captured with standard resummation techniques. Our formalism
provides the basis for higher-order logarithmic resummations of jet and other
non-global observables. As a nontrivial consistency check, we use it to obtain
explicit two-loop results for all logarithmically enhanced terms in cone-jet

scenarios, such as theories of supersymmetry, baryogenesis, and neutral

experimental challenges for the LHC. A major bottleneck for current LLP
searches is the prediction of SM backgrounds, which are often impossible to
simulate accurately. In this paper, we propose a general strategy for obtaining
differential, data-driven background estimates in LLP searches, thereby notably
extending the range of LLP masses and lifetimes that can be discovered at the
LHC. We focus on LLPs decaying in the ATLAS Muon System, where triggers
providing both signal and control samples are available at the LHC Run-2. While
many existing searches require two displaced decays, a detailed knowledge of
backgrounds will allow for very inclusive searches that require just one
detected LLP decay. As we demonstrate for the $h \to X X$ signal model of LLP
pair production in exotic Higgs decays, this results in dramatic sensitivity
improvements for proper lifetimes $\gtrsim 10$ m. In theories of Neutral
Naturalness, this extends reach to glueball masses far below the $\bar b b$
threshold. Our strategy readily generalizes to other signal models, and other
detector subsystems. This framework therefore lends itself to the development
of a systematic, model-independent LLP search program, in analogy to the highly
successful simplified-model framework of prompt searches.

treated as test particles, a radial pressure bump traps dust particles that
drift radially inward. As the dust particles become more concentrated at the
gas pressure bump, however, the drag force from dust to gas (back-reaction),
which is ignored in a test-particle approach, deforms the pressure bump. We
find that the pressure bump is completely deformed by the back-reaction when
the dust-to-gas mass ratio reaches $\sim 1$ for a slower bump restoration. The
direct gravitational instability of dust particles is inhibited by the bump
destruction. In the dust-enriched region, the radial pressure support becomes
$\sim 10-100$ times lower than the global value set initially. Although the
pressure bump is a favorable place for streaming instability (SI), the
flattened pressure gradient inhibits SI from forming large particle clumps
corresponding to $100-1000$ km sized bodies, which has been previously
proposed. If SI occurs there, the dust clumps formed would be $10-100$ times
smaller, that is, of about $1 - 100$ km.

contributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate
galaxies. However, we also find that ram pressure stripping is less efficient
than expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that,
although ram pressure stripping can eventually completely strip these galaxies,
other physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with
the rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low mass Milky Way
dwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this

one order of magnitude over 5--20 years between ROSAT observations and the XMM
Slew Survey. Follow-up observations were obtained with the Swift satellite.
After removal of two probable spurious sources, we find that the sample has
global properties which differ little from a non-varying control sample drawn
from the wider XMM-Slew/ROSAT/Veron sample of all secure AGN detections. A wide
range of AGN types are represented in the varying sample. The black hole mass
distributions for the varying and non-varying sample are not significantly
different. This suggests that long timescale variability is not strongly
affected by black hole mass. There is marginal evidence that the variable
sources have a lower redshift (2$\sigma$) and X-ray luminosity (1.7$\sigma$).
Apart from two radio-loud sources, the sample have normal optical-X-ray ratios
($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) when at their peak but are X-ray weak during their lowest
flux measurements. Drawing on our results and other studies, we are able to
identify a variety of variability mechanisms at play: tidal disruption events,
jet activity, changes in absorption, thermal emission from the inner accretion
disc, and variable accretion disc reflection. Little evidence for strong
absorption is seen in the majority of the sample and single-component

factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of
universal fault-tolerant computing:
  (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability
of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control as
its natural instrumentation set; (ii) a model based on a metaplectic
topological quantum computer (MTQC). A natural choice to implement Shor's
algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic
into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to emulate the standard
binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three-level system.
We compare the two approaches and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's
period finding function in the two models. We also highlight the fact that the
cost of achieving universality through magic states in MTQC architecture is
asymptotically lower than in generic ternary case.

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code, VINE, to model a self-gravitating
binary system similar to the GG Tau A system. We simulate systems configured
with semi-major axes of either $a=62$~AU (`wide') or $a=32$~AU (`close'), and
with eccentricity of either $e=0$ or $e=0.3$. Strong spiral structures are
generated with large material streams extending inwards. A small fraction
accretes onto the circumstellar disks, with most returning to the torus.
Structures also propagate outwards, generating net outwards mass flow and
eventually losing coherence at large distances. The torus becomes significantly
eccentric in shape. Accretion onto the stars occurs at a rate of a few
$\times10^{-8}$\msun/yr implying disk lifetimes shorter than $\sim10^4$~yr,
without replenishment. Only wide configurations retain disks by virtue of
robust accretion. In eccentric configurations, accretion is episodic, occurs
preferentially onto the secondary at wrates peaked near binary periapse. We
conclude that the \ggtaua\ torus is strongly self gravitating and that a major
contribution to its thermal energy is shock dissipation. We interpret its
observed features as manifestations of spiral structures and the low density
material surrounding it as an excretion disk created by outward mass flux. We
interpret GG Tau A as a coplanar system with an eccentric torus, and account
for its supposed mutual inclination as due to degeneracy between the
interpretation of inclination and eccentricity. Although the disks persist for
long enough to permit planet formation, the environment remains unfavorable due
to high temperatures. We conclude that the GG Tau A system is in an eccentric,

find a martingale---an expression on the program variables whose expectation

infer properties at termination time. One of the main challenges, then, is to
systematically find martingales.
  We propose a novel procedure to synthesize martingale expressions from an
arbitrary initial expression. Contrary to state-of-the-art approaches, we do
not rely on constraint solving. Instead, we use a symbolic construction based
on Doob's decomposition. This procedure can produce very complex martingales,
expressed in terms of conditional expectations.
  We show how to automatically generate and simplify these martingales, as well
as how to apply the optional stopping theorem to infer properties at
termination time. This last step typically involves some simplification steps,
and is usually done manually in current approaches. We implement our techniques
in a prototype tool and demonstrate our process on several classical examples.

a more metal-rich and/or younger population in Sculptor that does not produce

jets from mergers of neutron-stars (NS) or neutron-stars and black-holes (BH).
If the Lorentz-factors $\Gamma$ of jets from compact-stellar-mergers follow a
similar power-law distribution to those observed for other high-energy
astrophysical phenomena (e.g. blazars, AGN), the population of jets would be
dominated by low-$\Gamma$ outflows. These jets will not produce the prompt
gamma-rays, but jet energy will be released as x-ray/optical/radio transients
when they collide with the ambient medium. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
study the properties of such transients. Approximately $78\%$ of merger-jets
$<300~$Mpc result in failed-GRBs if the jet $\Gamma$ follows a power-law
distribution of index $-1.75$. X-ray/optical transients from failed-GRBs will
have broad distributions of their characteristics: light-curves peak
$t_p\sim0.1-10~$days after a merger; flux peaks for x-ray
$10^{-6}{\rm~mJy}\lesssim~F_x\lesssim10^{-2}~$mJy; and optical flux peaks at
$14\lesssim~m_g\lesssim22$. X-ray transients are detectable by Swift XRT, and
$\sim85\%$ of optical transients will be detectable by telescopes with limiting
magnitude $m_g \gtrsim 21$, for well localized sources on the sky.
X-ray/optical transients are followed by radio transients with peak times
narrowly clustered around $t_p\sim10~$days, and peak flux of $\sim~10-100~$mJy
at 10 GHz and $\sim~0.1~$mJy at 150 MHz. By considering the all-sky rate of
short GRBs within the LIGO/Virgo range, the rate of on-axis orphan afterglows
from failed-GRB would be 2.6(26) per year for NS-NS(NS-BH) mergers,
respectively. Since merger jets from gravitational-wave (GW) trigger events
tend to be directed to us, a significant fraction of GW events could be
associated with the on-axis orphan afterglow.

and modify the velocity modulus relative to a smooth halo at the position of
the Sun, with ramifications for direct detection experiments. From a kinematic
decomposition of the dark matter and a real space analysis of all 24 halos, we
find that only one of the simulated Milky Way analogues has a detectable dark
disc component. This unique event was caused by a merger at late time with an
LMC-mass satellite at very low grazing angle. Considering that even this rare
scenario only enhances the dark matter density at the solar radius by 35% and
affects the high energy tail of the dark matter velocity distribution by less

asymmetric warping are covariant and alters the interpretation of the observed
disk emission. We employ 3 point spread function (PSF) subtraction methods to
reduce the stellar glare and instrumental artifacts to confirm that there is a
roughly 2:1 brightness asymmetry between the NW and SE extension. This specific

most relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,
consistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.
The baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the
Planck value (0.155) for the universe. When we account for the stellar baryons
associated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,
f_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our
analysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-
2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian
approach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from

vineyard images is a necessary task, susceptible of being automated through the
use of computer vision methods. A common and effective family of visual
detection algorithms are the scanning-window type, that slide a (usually) fixed
size window along the original image, classifying each resulting windowed-patch
as containing or not containing the target object. The simplicity of these
algorithms finds its most challenging aspect in the classification stage.
Interested in grapevine buds detection in natural field conditions, this paper
presents a classification method for images of grapevine buds ranging 100 to
1600 pixels in diameter, captured in outdoor, under natural field conditions,
in winter (i.e., no grape bunches, very few leaves, and dormant buds), without
artificial background, and with minimum equipment requirements. The proposed
method uses well-known computer vision technologies: Scale-Invariant Feature
Transform for calculating low-level features, Bag of Features for building an
image descriptor, and Support Vector Machines for training a classifier. When
evaluated over images containing buds of at least 100 pixels in diameter, the
approach achieves a recall higher than 0.9 and a precision of 0.86 over all
windowed-patches covering the whole bud and down to 60% of it, and scaled up to
window patches containing a proportion of 20%-80% of bud versus background
pixels. This robustness on the position and size of the window demonstrates its
viability for use as the classification stage in a scanning-window detection

to the distribution of energy in dissipation events. Indeed, if the event
energy distribution is steep enough, the smallest, unobservable events could be
the largest contributors to the total energy dissipation in the corona.
Previous observations have shown a wide distribution of energies but remain
inconclusive about the precise slope. Furthermore, these results rely on a very
crude estimate of the energy. On the other hand, more detailed spectroscopic
studies of structures such as coronal bright points do not provide enough
statistical information to derive their total contribution to heating. We aim
at getting a better estimate of the distributions of the energy dissipated in
coronal heating events using high-resolution, multi-channel Extreme
Ultra-Violet (EUV) data. To estimate the energies corresponding to heating
events and deduce their distribution, we detect brightenings in five EUV
channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). We combine the results of these detections and we use maps
of temperature and emission measure derived from the same observations to
compute the energies. We obtain distributions of areas, durations, intensities,
and energies (thermal, radiative, and conductive) of events. These
distributions are power-laws, and we find also power-law correlations between
event parameters. The energy distributions indicate that the energy from a
population of events like the ones we detect represents a small contribution to
the total coronal heating, even when extrapolating to smaller scales. The main
explanations for this are how heating events can be extracted from
observational data, and the incomplete knowledge of the thermal structure and
processes in the coronal plasma attainable from available observations.

today. Hundreds of thousands of people have already traveled across dangerous
sea passages from Turkish shores to Greek islands, resulting in thousands of
dead and missing, despite the best rescue efforts from both sides. One of the
main reasons is the total lack of any early warning-alerting system, which
could provide some preparation time for the prompt and effective deployment of
resources at the hot zones. This work is such an attempt for a systemic
analysis of the refugee influx in Greece, aiming at (a) the statistical and
signal-level characterization of the smuggling networks and (b) the formulation
and preliminary assessment of such models for predictive purposes, i.e., as the
basis of such an early warning-alerting protocol. To our knowledge, this is the
first-ever attempt to design such a system, since this refugee crisis itself
and its geographical properties are unique (intense event handling, little or
no warning). The analysis employs a wide range of statistical, signal-based and
matrix factorization (decomposition) techniques, including linear &
linear-cosine regression, spectral analysis, ARMA, SVD, Probabilistic PCA, ICA,
K-SVD for Dictionary Learning, as well as fractal dimension analysis. It is
established that the behavioral patterns of the smuggling networks closely
match (as expected) the regular burst and pause periods of store-and-forward
networks in digital communications. There are also major periodic trends in the
range of 6.2-6.5 days and strong correlations in lags of four or more days,
with distinct preference in the Sunday-Monday 48-hour time frame. These results
show that such models can be used successfully for short-term forecasting of

strings which might be a necessary ingredient to obtain a consistent theory of

the horizon could be arbitrarily high, and this observation is difficult to
reconcile with the finiteness of the entropy of black holes. After preliminary
remarks, we review our recent attempt to evaluate the entropy of large black
holes in terms of fundamental strings. We also speculate on implications for

ultra-low temperature. However, when the junction is appropriately biased by a

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars also show enhancement in elements
produced mainly by the s-process (CEMP-s stars) and evidence suggests that the
origin of these non-standard abundances can be traced to mass transfer from a
binary asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. Thus, observations of CEMP-s
stars are commonly used to infer the nucleosynthesis output of low-metallicity
AGB stars. A crucial step in this exercise is understanding what happens to the
accreted material after mass transfer ceases. Here we present models of the
post-mass-transfer evolution of CEMP-s stars considering the physics of
thermohaline mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative levitation. We
find that stars with typical CEMP-s star masses (M ~ 0.85 Msun) have very
shallow convective envelopes (Menv < 1e-7 Msun). Hence, the surface abundance
variations arising from the competition between gravitational settling and
radiative levitation should be orders of magnitude larger than observed (e.g.
[C/Fe]<-1 or [C/Fe]>+4). We are therefore unable to reproduce the spread in the
observed abundances with these models and conclude that some other physical
process must largely suppress atomic diffusion in the outer layers of CEMP-s
stars. We demonstrate that this could be achieved by some additional
(turbulent) mixing process operating at the base of the convective envelope, as
found by other authors. Alternatively, mass-loss rates around 1e-13 Msun/yr
could also negate most of the abundance variations by eroding the surface
layers and forcing the base of the convective envelope to move inwards in mass.
Since atomic diffusion cannot have a substantial effect on the surface
abundances of CEMP-s stars, the dilution of the accreted material, while
variable in degree from one star to the next, is most likely the same for all
elements.

models of new physics. Testing if a particular parameter set of such a model is
excluded by LHC data is a challenge: It requires the time consuming generation
of scattering events, the simulation of the detector response, the event
reconstruction, cross section calculations and analysis code to test against
several hundred signal regions defined by the ATLAS and CMS experiment. In the
BSM-AI project we attack this challenge with a new approach. Machine learning
tools are thought to predict within a fraction of a millisecond if a model is
excluded or not directly from the model parameters. A first example is SUSY-AI,
trained on the phenomenological supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM). About
300,000 pMSSM model sets - each tested with 200 signal regions by ATLAS - have
been used to train and validate SUSY-AI. The code is currently able to
reproduce the ATLAS exclusion regions in 19 dimensions with an accuracy of at
least 93 percent. It has been validated further within the constrained MSSM and
a minimal natural supersymmetric model, again showing high accuracy. SUSY-AI
and its future BSM derivatives will help to solve the problem of recasting LHC
results for any model of new physics.

investigated by Kaufman and Onsager in the 1940s 6, are at the foundation of
numerous theoretical models but are challenging to measure experimentally.
Reciprocal space methods can map correlations, but at the single atom limit new
experimental probes are needed. Here, we determine the correlations between a
strongly hybridized spin impurity and its electron bath by varying the coupling
to a second magnetic impurity in the junction of a scanning tunneling
microscope. Electronic transport through these coupled spins reveals an
asymmetry in the differential conductance reminiscent of spin-polarized
transport in a magnetic field. We show that at zero field, this asymmetry can
be controlled by the coupling strength and is directly related to either
ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations.

combs. Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a
wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement
self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical
fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a
path towards the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide
broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and that are
compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential
to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date
self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by
applying conventional, fiber based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate
external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical
spectrum that spans two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a
continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal
dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this
coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f
self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the
soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio
frequency reference the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and
track the continuous wave pump laser's frequency. This work demonstrates the
principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide
microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.

enhancement ($\Delta Y$), present mass ratio between first and second stellar

($M_{GC}$), we envisage a possible scenario for the formation of these stellar
systems. Our approach allows for the possible loss of stars through evaporation
or tidal interactions and different star formation efficiencies. In our
approach the star formation efficiency of the first generation
($\epsilon_{1G}$) is the central factor that links the stellar generations as
it not only defines both the mass in stars of the first generation and the
remaining mass available for further star formation, but it also fixes the
amount of matter required to contaminate the second stellar generation. In this
way, $\epsilon_{1G}$ is fully defined by the He enhancement between successive
generations in a GC. We also show that globular clusters fit well within a
$\Delta Y$ {\it vs} $M_{1G}/M_{2G}$ diagram which indicates three different
evolutionary paths. The central one is for clusters that have not loss stars,
through tidal interactions, from either of their stellar generations, and thus
their present $M_{GC}$ value is identical to the amount of low mass stars ($M_*
\le$ 1 M$_\odot$) that resulted from both stellar generations. Other possible
evolutions imply either the loss of first generation stars or the combination
of a low star formation efficiency in the second stellar generation and/or a
loss of stars from the second generation. From these considerations we derive a
lower limit to the mass ($M_{tot}$) of the individual primordial clouds that
gave origin to globular clusters.

by $|x - x_0| \le L$ exhibits well-known phase transitions at length scales $L=
L_{crit}$ characterizing the CFT entanglements. For the thermofield double, the
numerical coefficients governing the effect of variations in $b(x)$ on the

gradients reduce $L_{crit}$ for $d \le 3$ but increase $L_{crit}$ for $d\ge4$.
This means that, while for general $L > L_{crit}$ they significantly increase
the mutual information of opposing slabs as one would expect, for $d\ge 4$

solutions, of a coupled two-component integrable PDE found by Geng and Xue as a
generalization of Novikov's cubically nonlinear Camassa-Holm type equation. In
order to make sense of such solutions, we find it necessary to assume that
there are no overlaps, meaning that a peakon or shockpeakon in one component is
not allowed to occupy the same position as a peakon or shockpeakon in the other
component. Therefore one can distinguish many inequivalent configurations,
depending on the order in which the peakons or shockpeakons in the two
components appear relative to each other. Here we are in particular interested
in the case of interlacing peakon solutions, where the peakons alternatingly
occur in one component and in the other. Based on explicit expressions for
these solutions in terms of elementary functions, we describe the general
features of the dynamics, and in particular the asymptotic large-time
behaviour. As far as the positions are concerned, interlacing Geng-Xue peakons
display the usual scattering phenomenon where the peakons asymptotically travel
with constant velocities, which are all distinct, except that the two fastest
peakons will have the same velocity. However, in contrast to many other peakon
equations, the amplitudes of the peakons will not in general tend to constant
values; instead they grow or decay exponentially. Thus the logarithms of the
amplitudes (as functions of time) will asymptotically behave like straight
lines, and comparing these lines for large positive and negative times, one
observes phase shifts similar to those seen for the positions of the peakons.
In addition to these K+K interlacing pure peakon solutions, we also investigate
1+1 shockpeakon solutions, and collisions leading to shock formation in a 2+2
peakon-antipeakon solution.

adsorbates are predicted to exhibit an exponential sensitivity to local surface
curvature, leading to either a large net enhancement or suppression over smooth

results suggests that heating rates can be tuned over orders of magnitudes.

consider turbulent electromagnetic fields obtained from direct numerical
simulations of the MHD equations with a strong background magnetic field. In
order to explore the flow compressibilty effect over the particle dynamics we
performed different numerical experiments: an incompressible case, and two weak
compressible cases with Mach number M = 0.1 and M = 0.25. We analyze the
behavior of protons and electrons in those turbulent fields, which are well
known to form aligned current sheets in the direction of the guide magnetic
field. What we call protons and electrons are test particles with scales
comparable to (for protons) and much smaller than (for electrons) the
dissipative scale of MHD turbulence, maintaining the correct mass ratio me /mi.
For these test particles we show that compressibility enhances the efficiency
of proton acceleration, and that the energization is caused by perpendicular
electric fields generated between currents sheets. On the other hand, electrons
remain magnetized and display an almost adiabatic motion, with no effect of
compressibility observed. Another set of numerical experiments takes into
account two fluid modifications, namely electric field due to Hall effect and
electron pressure gradient. We show that the electron pressure has an important
contribution to electron acceleration allowing highly parallel energization. In
contrast, no significant effect of these additional terms is observed for the

A preliminary version of this paper appears in ICALP 2016",,,,"cs.CC math.AG math.CO math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One fundamental question in the context of the geometric complexity theory
approach to the VP vs. VNP conjecture is whether VP = $\overline{\textrm{VP}}$,
where VP is the class of families of polynomials that are of polynomial degree
and can be computed by arithmetic circuits of polynomial size, and
$\overline{\textrm{VP}}$ is the class of families of polynomials that are of
polynomial degree and can be approximated infinitesimally closely by arithmetic
circuits of polynomial size. The goal of this article is to study the
conjecture in (Mulmuley, FOCS 2012) that $\overline{\textrm{VP}}$ is not
contained in VP.
  Towards that end, we introduce three degenerations of VP (i.e., sets of
points in $\overline{\textrm{VP}}$), namely the stable degeneration Stable-VP,
the Newton degeneration Newton-VP, and the p-definable one-parameter
degeneration VP*. We also introduce analogous degenerations of VNP. We show
that Stable-VP $\subseteq$ Newton-VP $\subseteq$ VP* $\subseteq$ VNP, and
Stable-VNP = Newton-VNP = VNP* = VNP. The three notions of degenerations and
the proof of this result shed light on the problem of separating
$\overline{\textrm{VP}}$ from VP.
  Although we do not yet construct explicit candidates for the polynomial
families in $\overline{\textrm{VP}}\setminus$VP, we prove results which tell us
where not to look for such families. Specifically, we demonstrate that the
families in Newton-VP $\setminus$ VP based on semi-invariants of quivers would
have to be non-generic by showing that, for many finite quivers (including some
wild ones), any Newton degeneration of a generic semi-invariant can be computed
by a circuit of polynomial size. We also show that the Newton degenerations of
perfect matching Pfaffians, monotone arithmetic circuits over the reals, and
Schur polynomials have polynomial-size circuits.

short-lived flare was associated with positive magnetic polarities and a
negative polarity inside, as revealed by the photospheric line-of-sight

point and spine-fan configuration in the corona. The flare was triggered by the
eruption of a mini-filament residing in the AR, which produced the inner flare
ribbon (IFR) and the southern part of a closed circular flare ribbon (CFR).
When the eruptive filament reached the null point, it triggered null point
magnetic reconnection with the ambient open field and generated the bright CFR
and a blowout jet. Raster observations of the \textit{Interface Region Imaging

this paper, we present an approach to enhancing the performance of the

strategy. Firstly, we divide all rules (27 in total) into four main classes,
namely, SPO rules (5 rules), type rules (7 rules), sameAs rules (7 rules), and
schema rules (8 rules) since, as we investigated, those triples corresponding
to the first three classes of rules are overwhelming (e.g., over 99% in the
LUBM dataset) in our practical world. Secondly, based on the interdependence
among those entailment rules in each class, we pick out an optimal rule
executable order of each class and then combine them into a new rule execution
order of all rules. Finally, we implement the new rule execution order on Spark
in a prototype called RORS. The experimental results show that the running time
of RORS is improved by about 30% as compared to Kim & Park's algorithm (2015)

paramagnetic susceptibilities has been supported by earlier studies. The
alignment of such grains depends on the so-called RAT parameter $q^{\max}$ that
is determined by the grain shape. In this paper, we elaborate our model of RAT
alignment for grains with enhanced magnetic susceptibility due to iron
inclusions, such that RAT alignment is magnetically enhanced for which we term
MRAT mechanism. Such grains can get aligned with high angular momentum at the
so-called high-J attractor points, achieving a high degree of alignment. Using
our analytical model of RATs we derive the critical value of the magnetic
relaxation parameter $\delta_{m}$ to produce high-J attractor points as
functions of $q^{\max}$ and the anisotropic radiation angle relative to the
magnetic field $\psi$. We find that if about $10\%$ of total iron abundance
present in silicate grains are forming iron clusters, it is sufficient to
produce high-J attractor points for all reasonable values of $q^{\max}$. To
calculate the degree of grain alignment, we carry out numerical simulations of
MRAT alignment by including stochastic excitations from gas collisions and
magnetic fluctuations. We show that large grains can achieve perfect alignment
when the high-J attractor point is present, regardless of the values of
$q^{\max}$. Our obtained results pave the way for physical modeling of

find that millimeter-sized grains in accretion disks may be aligned with the

show that, above a certain border, the nonlinear interactions between atoms
lead to the emergence of dynamical thermalization which generates the

tracking the transport map. We are interested in the role of depth (why do DNNs
perform better than shallow models?) and the interpretation of DNNs (what do
intermediate layers do?) Despite the rapid development in their application,
DNNs remain analytically unexplained because the hidden layers are nested and
the parameters are not faithful. Inspired by the integral representation of
shallow NNs, which is the continuum limit of the width, or the hidden unit
number, we developed the flow representation and transport analysis of DNNs.
The flow representation is the continuum limit of the depth or the hidden layer
number, and it is specified by an ordinary differential equation with a vector
field. We interpret an ordinary DNN as a transport map or a Euler broken line
approximation of the flow. Technically speaking, a dynamical system is a
natural model for the nested feature maps. In addition, it opens a new way to
the coordinate-free treatment of DNNs by avoiding the redundant parametrization
of DNNs. Following Wasserstein geometry, we analyze a flow in three aspects:
dynamical system, continuity equation, and Wasserstein gradient flow. A key
finding is that we specified a series of transport maps of the denoising
autoencoder (DAE). Starting from the shallow DAE, this paper develops three
topics: the transport map of the deep DAE, the equivalence between the stacked
DAE and the composition of DAEs, and the development of the double continuum
limit or the integral representation of the flow representation. As partial
answers to the research questions, we found that deeper DAEs converge faster
and the extracted features are better; in addition, a deep Gaussian DAE
transports mass to decrease the Shannon entropy of the data distribution.

mixed generalized multiscale finite element (GMsFE) basis methods for elliptic
PDEs with random inputs. Mixed generalized multiscale finite element method
(GMsFEM) is one of the accurate and efficient approaches to solve multiscale
problem in a coarse grid with local mass conservation. When the inputs of the
PDEs are parameterized by the random variables, the GMsFE basis functions
usually depend on the random parameters. This leads to a large number degree of
freedoms for the mixed GMsFEM and substantially impacts on the computation
efficiency. In order to overcome the difficulty, we develop reduced mixed GMsFE
basis methods such that the multiscale basis functions are independent of the
random parameters and span a low-dimensional space. To this end, a greedy
algorithm is used to find a set of optimal samples from a training set
scattered in the parameter space. Reduced mixed GMsFE basis functions are
constructed based on the optimal samples using two optimal sampling strategies:
basis-oriented cross-validation and proper orthogonal decomposition. Although
the dimension of the space spanned by the reduced mixed GMsFE basis functions
is much smaller than the dimension of the original full order model, the online
computation still depends on the number of coarse degree of freedoms. To
significantly improve the online computation, we integrate the reduced mixed
GMsFE basis methods with sparse tensor approximation and obtain a sparse
representation for the model's outputs. The sparse representation is very
efficient for evaluating the model's outputs for many instances of parameters.
To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, we present a few numerical
examples for multsicale problems with random inputs.

It consists of

However some systems do not show significant distortions in their radial
velocity curves. We found some differences between the directions of the
photometric and kinematic major axes in the main galaxies with a bar subsystem.
The Tully-Fisher relation in the B-band and Ks-band for the present sample of
M51-type systems is flatter when compared with isolated galaxies. Using the
radial velocity data set, we built a synthetic normalized radial velocity
distribution, as a reference for future modeling of these peculiar systems. The
synthetic rotation curve, representing the typical rotation curve of the main
galaxy in an M51-type pair, is near to solid body-like inside 4 kpc, and then
is nearly flat within the radial range 5-15 kpc. The relative position angles
between the main galaxy major axis and the companion location, as well as the
velocity difference amplitude, indicate that the orbital motion of the
satellite has a large projection on the main galaxy equatorial plane. In
addition, the radial velocity differences between the two galaxies indicate
that the satellite orbital motion is within the range of amplitudes of the main
galaxy rotation curve and all the M51-type systems studied here except for one,

complete or fractional decay in convectively-unstable continua, the absence of

of the customer while minimizing cost. Since the total time needed to charge
the EV up to capacity is often less than the amount of time that the customer
is away, there are opportunities to exploit electricity spot price variations
within some reservation window. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon
Markov decision process (MDP) and consider a risk-averse objective function by
optimizing under a dynamic risk measure constructed using a convex combination
of expected value and conditional value at risk (CVaR). It has been recognized
that the objective function of a risk-averse MDP lacks a practical
interpretation. Therefore, in both academic and industry practice, the dynamic
risk measure objective is often not of primary interest; instead, the
risk-averse MDP is used as a computational tool for solving problems with
predefined ""practical"" risk and reward objectives (termed the base model). In
this paper, we study the extent to which the two sides of this framework are
compatible with each other for the EV setting -- roughly speaking, does a ""more
risk-averse"" MDP provide lower risk in the practical sense as well? In order to
answer such a question, the effect of the degree of dynamic risk-aversion on
the optimal MDP policy is analyzed. Based on these results, we also propose a
principled approximation approach to finding an instance of the risk-averse MDP
whose optimal policy behaves well under the practical objectives of the base

operated at a significantly higher level of profitability if dynamic charging

the nuclear regions of galaxies, focusing on the Milky Way's Central Molecular
Zone (CMZ). In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a
combination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In
gravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting
feedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We
show that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large
radii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at
$\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This
ring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\sim 5-10$ Myr
occurring at $\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals. During quiescence the gas in the ring
is not fully cleared, but is driven out of a self-gravitating state by the
momentum injected by expanding supernova remnants. Starbursts also drive a wind
off the star-forming ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to the
star formation rate. We show that our model agrees well with the observed
properties of the CMZ, and places it near a star formation minimum within the
evolutionary cycle. We argue that such cycles of bursty star formation and
winds should be ubiquitous in the nuclei of barred spiral galaxies, and show
that the resulting distribution of galactic nuclei on the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation is in good agreement with that observed in nearby galaxies.

electrodynamics arising from QED corrections. Our scheme employs a pulsed laser
to create Compton backscattered photons off a high energy electron beam, with
the FCC-ee as a particularly interesting example. These photons will pass
through a strong static magnetic field, which changes the state of polarization
of the radiation - an effect proportional to the photon energy. This change
will be measured by the use of an aligned single-crystal, where a large
difference in the pair production cross-sections can be achieved. In the
proposed experimental setup the birefringence effect gives rise to a difference
in the number of pairs created in the analyzing crystal, stemming from the fact
that the initial laser light has a varying state of polarization, achieved with
a rotating quarter wave plate. Evidence for the vacuum birefringent effect will
be seen as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform spectrum of the
pair-production rate signal. This tell-tale signal can be significantly above
background with only few hours of measurement, in particular at high energies.

probability distribution of such events that can be easily sampled. For
nearfield events, the distribution of slip on the fault can have a significant
effect on the resulting tsunami. We present an approach to defining a
probability distribution based on subdividing the fault geometry into many
subfaults and prescribing a desired covariance matrix relating slip on one
subfault to slip on any other subfault. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
this matrix are then used to define a Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion for random
slip patterns. This is similar to a spectral representation of random slip
based on Fourier series but conforms to a general fault geometry. We show that
only a few terms in this series are needed to represent the features of the
slip distribution that are most important in tsunami generation, first with a
simple one-dimensional example where slip varies only in the down-dip direction
and then on a portion of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

information carried by neural populations. But the limited samples of spike
counts during recording usually result in model overfitting. Besides, current
models assume spike counts to be Poisson-distributed, which ignores the fact
that many neurons demonstrate over-dispersed spiking behaviour. Although the
Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM) provides a powerful tool
for modeling over-dispersed spike counts, the maximum likelihood-based standard
NB-GLM leads to highly variable and inaccurate parameter estimates. Thus, we
propose a hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes method to estimate the neural
spike responses among neuronal population. Our method integrates both
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and empirical Bayes theory, which aims to (1)
improve the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimation, compared to the
maximum likelihood-based method for NB-GLM and Poisson-GLM; (2) effectively
capture the over-dispersion nature of spike counts from both simulated data and
experimental data; and (3) provide insight into both neural interactions and
spiking behaviours of the neuronal populations. We apply our approach to study
both simulated data and experimental neural data. The estimation of simulation
data indicates that the new framework can accurately predict mean spike counts
simulated from different models and recover the connectivity weights among
neural populations. The estimation based on retinal neurons demonstrate the
proposed method outperforms both NB-GLM and Poisson-GLM in terms of the

identify sparse linear systems by employing a sparsity-promoting continuous
function as an approximation of l0 pseudonorm penalty. However, the performance
of this algorithm is sensitive to the appropriate choice of the some parameter
responsible for the zero-attracting intensity. The optimum choice for this
parameter depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prevailing in the system.
Thus, it becomes difficult to fix a suitable value for this parameter,
particularly in a situation where SNR fluctuates over time. In this work, we
propose several adaptive combinations of differently parameterized l0-LMS to
get an overall satisfactory performance independent of the SNR, and discuss
some issues relevant to these combination structures. We also demonstrate an
efficient partial update scheme which not only reduces the number of
computations per iteration, but also achieves some interesting performance gain
compared with the full update case. Then, we propose a new recursive least
squares (RLS)-type rule to update the combining parameter more efficiently.
Finally, we extend the combination of two filters to a combination of M number
adaptive filters, which manifests further improvement for M > 2.

drawn from certain general stationary stochastic processes. Here by
\emph{general}, we mean that many stationary stochastic processes can be

Bernstein-type inequality, a unified treatment on analyzing the learning
schemes with various mixing processes can be conducted and a sharp oracle
inequality for generic regularized empirical risk minimization schemes can be
established. The obtained oracle inequality is then applied to derive
convergence rates for several learning schemes such as empirical risk
minimization (ERM), least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) using given
generic kernels, and SVMs using Gaussian kernels for both least squares and
quantile regression. It turns out that for i.i.d.~processes, our learning rates
for ERM recover the optimal rates. On the other hand, for non-i.i.d.~processes
including geometrically $\alpha$-mixing Markov processes, geometrically
$\alpha$-mixing processes with restricted decay, $\phi$-mixing processes, and
(time-reversed) geometrically $\mathcal{C}$-mixing processes, our learning
rates for SVMs with Gaussian kernels match, up to some arbitrarily small extra
term in the exponent, the optimal rates. For the remaining cases, our rates are
at least close to the optimal rates. As a by-product, the assumed generalized
Bernstein-type inequality also provides an interpretation of the so-called

asymptotic analysis can be derived out from this new method, and hence the
mathematical essence of the RG method is also recovered. The biggest advantage
of the proposed method is that the secular terms in perturbation series are
automatically eliminated, but in usual perturbation theory, we need more
efforts and tricks to eliminate these terms. At the same time, the mathematical
foundation of the method is simple and the logic of the method is very clear,
therefore, it is very easy in practice. As application, we obtain the uniform
valid asymptotic solutions to some problems including vector field, boundary
layer and boundary value problems of nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, we
discuss the normal form theory and reduction equations of dynamical systems.
Furthermore, by combining the topological deformation and the RG method, a
modified method namely the homotopy renormalization method (for simplicity,
HTR) wasproposed to overcome the weaknesses of the standard RG method. In this
HTR method, since there is a freedom to choose the first order approximate
solution in perturbation expansion, we can improve the global solution. In
particular, for those equations including no a small parameter, the HTR method
can also be applied. Some concrete applications including multi-solutions
problems, the forced Duffing equation and the Blasius equation are given.

$\alpha$-strongly-decaying block $K$-sparse signal can be exactly or stably

newly found sufficient condition on the block-RIP of $\A$ is less restrictive

Furthermore, for any $K\geq 1$, $\alpha>1$ and $\sqrt{2}/2\leq \delta<1$, the
recovery of $\x$ may fail in $K$ iterations for a sensing matrix $\A$ which
satisfies the block-RIP with $\delta_{K+1}=\delta$. Finally, we study some
sufficient conditions for partial recovery of block sparse signals.
Specifically, if $\A$ satisfies the block-RIP with $\delta_{K+1}<\sqrt{2}/2$,
then BOMP is guaranteed to recover some blocks of $\x$ if these blocks satisfy

first considered approach to derive design criteria for the construction of
such codes is based on the Hurwitz-Radon (HR) Theory for mutual orthogonality
between the weight matrices defining the linear code. This appproach served to
construct new families of codes admitting fast sphere decoding such as
multi-group decodable, fast decodable, and fast-group decodable codes. In a
second Quadratic Form approach, the Fast Sphere Decoding (FSD) complexity of
linear STBCs is captured by a Hurwitz Radon Quadratic Form (HRQF) matrix based

linear STBCs considering an arbitrary number of antennas and linear STBCs of an
arbitrary coding rate. Then we apply the derived criteria to the three families

models. We add a scalar field, with negligible kinetic terms, to the
Einstein-Hilbert action. We also introduce a conformal coupling to matter. This
gives rise to a new screening mechanism which is not entirely due to the
non-linearity of the scalar field potential or the coupling function but to the
absence of the kinetic term. As a result this removes any fifth force between
isolated objects in vacuum. The predictions of these models only depend on a
single free function, as the potential and the coupling function are
degenerate, with an amplitude given by a parameter $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-6}$,
whose magnitude springs from requiring a small modification of Newton's
potential astrophysically and cosmologically. This singles out a redshift
$z_{\alpha} \sim \alpha^{-1/3} \gtrsim 100$ where the fifth force is the
greatest. The cosmological background follows the $\Lambda$-CDM history within
a $10^{-6}$ accuracy, while cosmological perturbations are significantly
enhanced (or damped) on small scales, $k \gtrsim 2 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$.
The spherical collapse and the halo mass function are modified in the same
manner. We find that the modifications of gravity are greater for galactic or
sub-galactic structures. We also present a thermodynamic analysis of the
non-linear and inhomogeneous fifth-force regime where we find that the Universe
is not made more inhomogeneous before $z_\alpha$ when the fifth force
dominates, and does not lead to the existence of clumped matter on extra small
scales inside halos for large masses while this possibility exists for masses
$M\lesssim 10^{11} M_\odot$ where the phenomenology of ultra-local models would
be most different from $\Lambda$-CDM.

inequality is expressed in terms of pseudo-spin operators and quantum
expectation values are calculated for generic two-mode squeezed states

Allowing for generic values of the squeezing angle is especially relevant when
$\varphi$ is not under experimental control, such as in cosmic inflation, where
small quantum fluctuations in the early Universe are responsible for structures
formation. Compared to previous studies restricted to $\varphi=0$ and to a
fixed orientation of the pseudo-spin operators, allowing for $\varphi\neq 0$

phenomenology. Two dual schemes of approximation are designed that allow for
comprehensive exploration of the squeezing parameters space. In particular, it

systems, the lower crystalline symmetry of hexagonal close-packed metals
results in a reduced number of equivalent primary slips and anisotropy in

temperatures, the ductility of hexagonal close-packed metals improves owing to
the activation of secondary c+a pyramidal slip systems. Thus understanding the
fundamental properties of corresponding dislocations is essential for the
improvement of ductility at the ambient temperature. Here, we present the
results of large-scale ab-initio calculations for c+a pyramidal screw
dislocations in Mg and show that their slip behavior is a stark counterexample
to the conventional wisdom that a slip plane is determined by the stacking
fault plane of dislocations. A stacking fault between dissociated partial
dislocations can assume a non-planar shape with a negligible energy cost and
can migrate normal to its plane by a local shuffling of atoms. Partial
dislocations dissociated on a {2-1-12} plane ""slither"" in the {01-11} plane,
dragging the stacking fault with them in response to an applied shear stress.
This finding resolves the apparent discrepancy that both {2-1-12} and {01-11}
slip traces are observed in experiments while ab-initio calculations indicate
that dislocations preferably dissociate in the {01-11} planes.

select where and how they consume news.
  The IAA Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) post-detection
protocols, initially drafted in 1989 and updated in 2010, were written to guide
SETI scientists in the event of detecting evidence of extraterrestrial
intelligence, but do not give guidance as to how scientists should prepare to
navigate this media maelstrom. The protocols assume communications channels
between scientists and the public still resemble those of 1989, which were
specifically one-way with a narrative controlled by a select few media outlets.
  Modern SETI researchers must consider this modern paradigm for consumption of
news by the public, using social media and other non-traditional outlets, when
planning and executing searches for extraterrestrial intelligence. We propose
additions to the post-detection protocols as they pertain to the use of
internet and social media, as well as pre-search protocols. It is our belief
that such protocols are necessary if there is to be a well-informed, sane

Some of the biomedical text summarization systems put the basis of their
sentence selection approach on the frequency of concepts extracted from the
input text. However, it seems that exploring other measures rather than the
frequency for identifying the valuable content of the input document, and
considering the correlations existing between concepts may be more useful for
this type of summarization. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian summarizer
for biomedical text documents. The Bayesian summarizer initially maps the input
text to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts, then it selects
the important ones to be used as classification features. We introduce
different feature selection approaches to identify the most important concepts
of the text and to select the most informative content according to the
distribution of these concepts. We show that with the use of an appropriate
feature selection approach, the Bayesian biomedical summarizer can improve the
performance of summarization. We perform extensive evaluations on a corpus of

summarizer outperforms the biomedical summarizers that rely on the frequency of
concepts, the domain-independent and baseline methods based on the
Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. Moreover,
the results suggest that using the meaningfulness measure and considering the

spatially correlated patterns that can be interpreted based on the words
associated with them. The main language features can be related to slang use,
urbanization, travel, religion and ethnicity, the patterns of which are shown
to correlate plausibly with traditional census data. Our findings thus validate
the concept of demography being represented in OSN language use and show that
the traits observed are inherently present in the word frequencies without any
previous assumptions about the dataset. Thus, they could form the basis of
further research focusing on the evaluation of demographic data estimation from
other big data sources, or on the dynamical processes that result in the

majority of the luminescence intensity appears in the zero-phonon line;
nevertheless, about 30\% of the intensity manifests in the phonon sideband.
Since phonons play an essential role in the operation of this system, it is of
importance to understand the vibrational properties of the SiV center in
detail. To this end, we carry out density functional theory calculations of
dilute SiV centers by embedding the defect in supercells of a size of a few
thousand atoms. We find that there exist two well-pronounced quasi-local
vibrational modes (resonances) with $A_{2u}$ and $E_u$ symmetries,
corresponding to the vibration of the Si atom along and perpendicular to the
defect symmetry axis, respectively. Isotopic shifts of these modes explain the
isotopic shifts of prominent vibronic features in the experimental SiV PL
spectrum. Moreover, calculations show that the vibrational frequency of the
$A_{2u}$ mode increases by about 30\% in the excited state with respect to the
ground state, while the frequency of the $E_u$ mode increases by about 5\%.
These changes explain experimentally observed isotopic shifts of the
zero-phonon line energy. We also emphasize possible dangers of extracting
isotopic shifts of vibrational resonances from finite-size supercell
calculations, and instead propose a method to do this correctly.

overionization in the line formation layers and to weakened spectral lines, in

subordinate lines. Owing to large cross sections, the ion-pair production and
mutual neutralization processes Al I(nl) + H I(1s) $\leftrightarrow$
Al~II(3s^2) + H^- provide a close coupling of high-excitation Al I levels to
the Al II ground state, which causes smaller deviations from the TE populations
compared to the case of pure electron collisions. For three metal-poor stars,
the Al abundance was determined from seven lines in different models of their
formation. In LTE and in non-LTE calculations with pure electron collisions,
the Al I 3961 A resonance line gives a 0.25-0.45 dex lower abundance than the
mean from the subordinate lines. The difference is removed by accounting for
the collisions with H I, and the rms error of the abundance from all seven
lines decreases by a factor of 1.5-3 compared to LTE. We calculated the non-LTE
abundance corrections for six Al I lines depending on Teff (4500-6500 K), log g

stellar orbits of scattering by inhomogeneities in the Galactic potential due
to GMCs, spiral arms and the Galactic bar, and whether high-altitude clusters
could have formed in orbits closer to the Galactic plane and later been
scattered.
  Simulations of test-particle motions are performed in a realistic Galactic
potential. The effects of the internal structure of GMCs are explored. The
destruction of clusters in GMC collisions is treated in detail with N-body
simulations of the clusters.
  The observed velocity dispersions of stars as a function of time are well
reproduced. The GMC structure is found to be significant, but adequate models
produce considerable scattering effects. The fraction of simulated massive old
open clusters, scattered into orbits with |z| > 400 pc, is typically 0:5%, in
agreement with the observed number of high-altitude clusters and consistent
with the present formation rate of massive open clusters.
  The heating of the thin Galactic disk is well explained by gravitational
scattering by GMCs and spiral arms, if the local correlation between the GMC
mass and the corresponding voids in the gas is not very strong. Our results
suggest that the high-altitude metal-rich clusters were formed in orbits close

achieved by expressing receptive fields in CNNs as a weighted sum over a fixed

that we learn arbitrary effective filter sets from the basis rather than

error propagation from quality degradation of reference frames. Instinctively,
it is preferred to perform more lossy EC in non-reference frames to minimize
the quality loss. The analysis and experiments in this paper, however, will
show lossy EC should actually be distributed to more frames. Correspondingly,

random reorientations (tumbles), transiently suppressing tumbles whenever
attractant signal increases. This induces a functional coupling between
movement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the
internal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal
levels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state
close to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the
gradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient.
Importantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the
internal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on
what happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we
show here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter
space where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are
relatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of
non-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point)
inherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental
nonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this
amplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and
abbreviating others. The result is a ""ratchet-like"" gradient climbing behavior
with drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism.
Our results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation
--- wasteful runs in the wrong direction --- can be mitigated by exploiting the
non-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.

unexplained systematic effects in the polarization data of the Planck High
Frequency Instrument (HFI) on large angular scales, including new mapmaking and
calibration procedures, new and more complete end-to-end simulations, and a set
of robust internal consistency checks on the resulting maps. These maps, at
100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, are early versions of those that will be released
in final form later in 2016.
  The improvements allow us to determine the cosmic reionization optical depth
$\tau$ using, for the first time, the low-multipole $EE$ data from HFI,
reducing significantly the central value and uncertainty, and hence the upper
limit. Two different likelihood procedures are used to constrain $\tau$ from
two estimators of the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra at 100 and
143 GHz, after debiasing the spectra from a small remaining systematic
contamination. These all give fully consistent results.
  A further consistency test is performed using cross-correlations derived from
the Low Frequency Instrument maps of the Planck 2015 data release and the new
HFI data. For this purpose, end-to-end analyses of systematic effects from the
two instruments are used to demonstrate the near independence of their dominant
systematic error residuals.
  The tightest result comes from the HFI-based $\tau$ posterior distribution
using the maximum likelihood power spectrum estimator from $EE$ data only,
giving a value $0.055\pm 0.009$. In a companion paper these results are
discussed in the context of the best-fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model
and recent models of reionization.

applied over such local representation, which can drastically reduce the number

The design is based on a model, obtained via the constrained Lagrange

design consists of a partial feedback linearization step followed by a standard
PID controller acting on two passive outputs. Boundedness of all signals and

both particle shape and orientation. However, most previous theoretical work
has focused only on spherical particles and hence disregards the wide-ranging
particle shapes occurring in nature, such as those of bacteria. Here, by
implementing a simple model in one and two dimensions, we compare and contrast
receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis for a range of biologically
relevant shapes, including spheres, ellipsoids, capped cylinders, and
hourglasses. We find a whole range of different engulfment behaviors with some
ellipsoids engulfing faster than spheres, and that phagocytosis is able to
engulf a greater range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis.
Further, the 2D model can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf
fastest (not at all) when presented to the membrane tip-first (lying flat). Our
work reveals how some bacteria may avoid being internalized simply because of
their shape, and suggests shapes for optimal drug delivery.

of the burst ($\sim$1.7 s) and the large measured energy fluence
($\sim2.5\times10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) put it in the class of rare
""intermediate"" SGR flares, and this is the first one observed from SGR
1935+2154. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the KW light curve
yields no statistically significant signal. Of four spectral models tested,
optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung and a single blackbody (BB) function can
be rejected on statistical grounds; two more complex models, a cutoff power law

of the asymptotic behavior of the insensitive load balancing schemes when the
number of servers and the load scales jointly. These schemes have the desirable
property that the stationary distribution of the resulting stochastic network
depends on the distribution of job sizes only through its mean. It was shown
that they give good estimates of performance indicators for systems with finite
buffers, generalizing henceforth Erlang's formula whereas optimal policies are
already theoretically and computationally out of reach for networks of moderate
size. We study a single class of traffic acting on a symmetric set of processor
sharing queues with finite buffers and we consider the case where the load
scales with the number of servers. We characterize central limit theorems and
large deviations, the response of symmetric systems under those schemes at
different scales and show that three amplitudes of deviations can be
identified. A central limit scaling takes place for a sub-critical load; for
$\rho=1$, the number of free servers scales like $n^{ {\theta \over \theta+1}}$
($\theta$ being the buffer depth and $n$ being the number of servers) and is of
order 1 for super-critical loads. This further implies the existence of
different phases for the blocking probability, Before a (refined) critical load
$\rho_c(n)=1-a n^{- {\theta \over \theta+1}}$, the blocking is exponentially
small and becomes of order $ n^{- {\theta \over \theta+1}}$ at $\rho_c(n)$.
This generalizes the well-known Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED) regime or
Halfin-Whitt regime for a one-dimensional queue, and leads to a generalized
staffing rule for a given target blocking probability.

compare this method to other model selection methods using data generated from
a stochastic block model. Comparing latinCV to other cross-validation methods,
we show that latinCV performs similarly to a method described in
\cite{hoff2008modeling} and that latinCV has a significantly larger true model
recovery accuracy than the NCV method of \cite{chen2014network}. We also show
that the reason for this discrepancy is related to the larger variance of the

that latinCV performs better than information criteria AIC and BIC, as well as
the community detection method infomap and a routine that attempts to maximize
modularity. The simulation study in this paper includes a range of network
sizes and generative parameters for the stochastic block model that allow us to
examine the relationship between model selection accuracy and the size and
complexity of the model. Overall, latinCV performs more accurate model
selection, and avoids overfitting better than any of the other model selection

and probabilistic segmentation using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs);
(ii) accuracy refinement of initial segmentation with graph cut and the
previously learned probability map. Results The proposed approach was validated
on forty CT volumes taken from two public databases MICCAI-Sliver07 and
3Dircadb. For the MICCAI-Sliver07 test set, the calculated mean ratios of
volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average
symmetric surface distance (ASD), root mean square symmetric surface distance
(RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSD) are 5.9%, 2.7%, 0.91%, 1.88

without any user interaction. Quantitative results reveal that the proposed
approach is efficient and accurate for hepatic volume estimation in a clinical

that the proposed method can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and

(effective radius Re and stellar mass Mstar) and dynamical (velocity dispersion
sigma_e) parameters over the redshift range 0 < z < 1.6. We have derived the

which velocity dispersion measurements are available (11 ETGs). For 4 of them

number density of ultramassive dense ETGs evolves as rho(z) = K*(1 +
z)^(0.3\pm0.8) implying a decrease of ~ 25% of the population since z = 1.6. By
comparing the values of Re, Mstar, and sigma_e of ultramassive dense ETGs over
the range 0 < z < 1.6 we find that all the high-z ETGs have a counterpart in
the local universe. This implies either that the majority (~70%) of
ultramassive dense ETGs has already completed its assembly and its shaping at
<z> = 1.4, or that, if a significant fraction of them evolves in size, new
ultramassive dense ETGs must form at z < 1.5 to maintain their number density
almost constant. The difficulty into identify good progenitors for these new
dense ETGs at z < 1.5, and the stellar populations properties of local
ultramassive dense ETGs point toward the first hypothesis.

information about Titan atmospheric chemistry and the formation of its
aerosols, the exact composition of these aerosols still remains unknown. A
fruitful proxy to investigate these aerosols is the use of laboratory
experiments that allow producing and studying analogs of Titan aerosol, the
so35 called tholins. Even when produced in the laboratory, unveiling the exact
composition of the aerosol remains problematic due to the high complexity of
the material. Numerous advances have been recently made using high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Pernot et al. 2010, Somogyi et al. 2012, Gautier et
al. 2014) that allowed the separation of isobaric compounds and a robust
identification of chemical species composing tholins regarding their molecular
formulae. Nevertheless isomeric species cannot be resolved by a simple mass
measurement. We propose here an analysis of tholins by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled to HRMS to unveil this isomeric ambiguity for
some of the major tholins compounds. By comparing chromatograms obtained when
analyzing tholins and chemical standards, we strictly identified seven
molecules in our tholins samples: melamine, cyanoguanidine,
6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 3-amino-
1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-Dimethyl-1,2,4-triazole and 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine.
Several molecules, including hexamethylenetriamine (HMT) were not present at
detectable levels in our sample. The use for the first time of a coupled
HPLC-HRMS technique applied to tholins study demonstrated the interest of such
a technique compared to single high-resolution mass spectrometry for the study
of tholins composition.

used to understand magnetism in the context of stellar evolution of solar-like
stars and, the past of the Sun and the solar system. This is also important for
the atmospheric evolution of the inner planets, Earth in particular. We used
Stokes IV data from two different spectropolarimeters, NARVAL and HARPSpol. The
least-squares deconvolution multi-line technique was used to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We then applied a modern Zeeman-Doppler
imaging code in order to reconstruct the magnetic topology of all stars and the
brightness distribution of one of our studied stars. Our results show a
significant decrease in the magnetic field strength and energy as the stellar
age increases from 100Myr to 250Myr while there is no significant age
dependence of the mean magnetic field strength for stars with ages 250-650Myr.
The spread in the mean field strength between different stars is comparable to
the scatter between different observations of individual stars. The meridional
field component has the weakest strength compared to the radial and azimuthal
field components in 15 out of the 16 magnetic maps. It turns out that 89-97% of
the magnetic field energy is contained in l=1-3. There is also no clear trend
with age and distribution of field energy into poloidal/toroidal and
axisymmetric/non-axisymmetric components within the sample. The two oldest
stars in this study do show a twice as strong octupole component compared to
the quadrupole component. This is only seen in one out of 13 maps of the

insights on how spontaneous integration and segregation of information relate
to human cognition, and how this organization may be altered in different
conditions, and neurological disorders. This is particularly relevant for
patients in disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe acquired brain
damage and coma, one of the most devastating conditions in modern medical care.
We present a novel data-driven methodology, connICA, which implements
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the extraction of robust independent
FC patterns (FC-traits) from a set of individual functional connectomes,
without imposing any a priori data stratification into groups. We here apply
connICA to investigate associations between network traits derived from
task-free FC and cognitive/clinical features that define levels of
consciousness. Three main independent FC-traits were identified and linked to
consciousness-related clinical features. The first one represents the
functional configuration it is associated to a sedative (sevoflurane), the
overall effect of the pathology and the level of arousal. The second FC-trait
reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor connectivity
patterns. It also relates to the time since the insult and to the ability of
communicating with the external environment. The third FC-trait isolates the
connectivity pattern encompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode
network areas as well as the interaction between left and right hemispheres,
which are also associated to the awareness of the self and its surroundings.
Each FC-trait represents a distinct functional process with a role in the
degradation of conscious states of functional brain networks, shedding further
light on the functional subcircuits that get disrupted in severe brain-damage.

of three linear pendulums (one per leg and one for the whole upper body) to
describe stance, swing and torso dynamics. In addition to double support, this
model has different actuation possibilities in the swing hip and stance ankle
which could be widely used to produce different walking gaits. Without the need
for numerical time-integration, closed-form solutions help finding periodic
gaits which could be simply scaled in certain dimensions to modulate the motion
online. Thanks to linearity properties, the proposed model can provide a
computationally fast platform for model predictive controllers to predict the
future and consider meaningful inequality constraints to ensure feasibility of
the motion. Such property is coming from describing dynamics with joint torques
directly and therefore, reflecting hardware limitations more precisely, even in
the very abstract high level template space. The proposed model produces
human-like torque and ground reaction force profiles and thus, compared to
point-mass models, it is more promising for precise control of humanoid robots.
Despite being linear and lacking many other features of human walking like CoM
excursion, knee flexion and ground clearance, we show that the proposed model
can predict one of the main optimality trends in human walking, i.e. nonlinear
speed-frequency relationship. In this paper, we mainly focus on describing the
model and its capabilities, comparing it with human data and calculating
optimal human gait variables. Setting up control problems and advanced

USNO-B1.0 catalogue entries at points throughout the celestial sphere were then
filtered for acceptable combinations of entry observations and magnitudes and
the resulting total of about 17,000 entries was winnowed down to a little more

candidates coincide with SDSS data. Those constituents fall into two groups,
single and paired objects. SDSS identified several galaxies in the first group.

renormalization group algorithm we calculate the charge gaps with high accuracy
for different widths and interaction strengths and compare them with mean-field
results. It turns out that the gaps are much smaller in the former case due to
the proper treatment of quantum fluctuations. Applying the elements of quantum
information theory we also reveal the entanglement structure inside a ribbon

of entanglement. We examine the possibility of magnetic ordering and the effect
of magnetic field. Our findings are relevant for understanding the gap values

Fuzzy clustering provides more flexibility than non-fuzzy methods by allowing

serious challenge in fuzzy clustering is the lack of scalability. Massive
datasets in emerging fields such as geosciences, biology and networking do
require parallel and distributed computations with high performance to solve
real-world problems. Although some clustering methods are already improved to
execute on big data platforms, but their execution time is highly increased for
large datasets. In this paper, a scalable Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering named
BigFCM is proposed and designed for the Hadoop distributed data platform. Based
on the map-reduce programming model, it exploits several mechanisms including
an efficient caching design to achieve several orders of magnitude reduction in
execution time. Extensive evaluation over multi-gigabyte datasets shows that
BigFCM is scalable while it preserves the quality of clustering.

planet hosts are nitrogen-rich when compared to single stars. However, given
the linear trend between [N/Fe] vs [Fe/H], this fact can be explained as being
due to the metal-rich nature of planet hosts. We conclude that reliable N

We find a correlation between the mass accretion rate and the disk dust mass,
with a ratio that is roughly consistent with the expected viscous timescale
when assuming an interstellar medium (ISM) gas-to-dust ratio. This confirms
that mass accretion rates are related to the properties of the outer disk. We
find no correlation between mass accretion rates and the disk mass measured by
CO isotopologues emission lines, possibly owing to the small number of measured
disk gas masses. This suggests that the mm-sized dust mass better traces the
total disk mass and that masses derived from CO may be underestimated, at least
in some cases.

our UVES data set with previously published absorption-line data on Ti/Ca for
redshifts up to z~3.8. Our absorber sample contains 110 absorbers (DLAs,
sub-DLAs & LLSs). We compare our Ti/Ca findings with results from the Milky Way
and the Magellanic Clouds and discuss the properties of Ti/Ca absorbers in the
general context of quasar absorption-line systems.Our analysis indicates that
there are two distinct populations of absorbers with either high or low Ti/Ca
ratios with a separation at [Ti/Ca}]~1. While the calcium dust depletion in
most of the absorbers appears to be severe, the titanium depletions are mild in
systems with high Ti/Ca ratios. The derived trend indicates that absorbers with
high Ti/Ca ratios have dust-to-gas ratios that are substantially lower than in
the Milky Way. We characterize the overall nature of the absorbers by
correlating Ti/Ca with other observables (e.g., metallicity, velocity-component
structure) and by modeling the ionization properties of singly-ionized Ca and
Ti in different environments. We conclude that CaII and TiII bearing
absorption-line systems trace predominantly neutral gas in the disks and inner
halo regions of galaxies, where the abundance of Ca and Ti reflects the local
metal and dust content of the gas. Our study suggests that the Ti/Ca ratio
represents a useful measure for the gas-to-dust ratio and overall metallicity
in intervening absorption-line systems.

crucial to study a BD at the embedded phase. IRAS 16253-2429 is classified as a
very low luminosity object (VeLLO) with internal luminosity 0.1 Lsun. VeLLOs
are believed to be very low-mass protostars or even proto-BDs. We observed the

IRAM 30 m and APEX telescopes and the SMA in order to study its dynamical
features and physical properties. Our SMA map reveals two protostellar jets,
indicating the existence of a proto-binary system as implied by the precessing
jet detected in H2 emission. We detect a wiggling pattern in the
position-velocity diagrams along the jet axes, which is likely due to the
binary orbital motion. Based on this, we derive the current mass of the binary
as ~0.032 Msun. Given the low envelope mass, IRAS 16253-2429 will form a binary
that probably consist of one or two BDs. Furthermore, we found that the outflow
force as well as the mass accretion rate are very low based on the
multi-transition CO observations, which suggests that the final masses of the
binary components are at the stellar/substellar boundary. Since IRAS 16253 is
located in an isolated environment, we suggest that BDs can form through
fragmentation and collapse like low-mass stars.

Given temporally separated inputs, the cerebellar Purkinje cell learns to pause
its tonic inhibition of a motor pathway with high temporal precision so that an
overt blink occurs at the right time. Most models relegate the Purkinje cell's
passage-of-time representation to afferent granule cells, a subpopulation of
which is supposedly selected for synaptic depression in order to make the
Purkinje cell pause. However, granule cell models have recently faced two
crucial challenges: 1) bypassing granule cells and directly stimulating the
Purkinje cell's pre-synaptic fibers during training still produces a well-timed
pause, and 2) the Purkinje cell can reproduce the learned pause, invariant to
the temporal structure of probe stimulation. Here, we present a passage-of-time
model which is internal to the Purkinje cell and is invariant to probe

after a microbunched electron beam is kicked on a large angle compared to the
divergence of the FEL radiation, the microbunching wave front is readjusted
along the new direction of motion of the kicked beam. Therefore, coherent
radiation from an undulator placed after the kicker is emitted along the kicked
direction without suppression. This strong emission of coherent undulator
radiation in the kicked direction cannot be explained in the framework of
conventional synchrotron radiation theory. In a previous paper we explained
this puzzle. We demonstrated that, in accelerator physics, the coupling of
fields and particles is based, on the one hand, on the use of results from
particle dynamics treated according to the absolute time convention and, on the
other hand, on the use of Maxwell equations treated according to the standard
(Einstein) synchronization convention. Here lies the misconception which led to
the strong qualitative disagreement between theory and experiment. After the
""beam splitting"" experiment at LCLS, it became clear that the conventional
theory of synchrotron radiation cannot ensure the correct description of
coherent and spontaneous emission from a kicked electron beam, nor the emission
from a beam with finite angular divergence, in an undulator or a bending
magnet. However, this result requires further experimental confirmation. In
this publication we propose an uncomplicated and inexpensive experiment to test
synchrotron radiation theory at 3rd generation light sources.

elimination problem: Given a sports league and its remaining matches, we have
to decide whether a given team can still possibly win the competition, i.e.,
place first in the league at the end. Previously, the computational complexity
of this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teams
per game. In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leagues
in the British Parliamentary format, where four teams are participating in each

Debating League, even if at most two matches are remaining for each team. This
contrasts settings like football where two teams play in each game since there
this case is still polynomial time solvable. We prove our result even for a
fictitious restricted setting with only three teams per game. On the other
hand, for the common setting of Debating Tournaments we show that this problem
is fixed parameter tractable if the parameter is the number of remaining rounds
$k$. This also holds for the practically very important question of whether a
team can still qualify for the knock-out phase of the tournament and the
combined parameter $k + b$ where $b$ denotes the threshold rank for qualifying.
Finally, we show that the latter problem is polynomial time solvable for any

and structures of filaments in star-forming regions, as well as their role in
the process of star formation. Those filaments are normally identified as
elongated fibres across the plane of the sky. But how would we detect filaments
that are inclined? Aims: We aim to learn more about whether, and how, total
column density or dust temperature change with respect to the line of sight.
Such variations would enable observers to use dust observations to identify and
study filaments at any inclination and gain more insight on the distribution
and orientations of filaments within the Galactic plane. Methods: As a first
step, we perform numerical calculations on simple cylindrical models to
evaluate the influence of filament geometry on the average flux density. After
that, we apply our three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code
on two models of star-forming regions and derive maps of effective total column
density and dust temperature at different viewing angles. Results: We see only
slight changes of average flux density for all cylinders we study. For our more
complex models, we find that the effective dust temperature is not sensitive to
viewing angle, while the total column density is strongly influenced, with
differences exceeding an order of magnitude. The variations are not injective
with the viewing angle and depend on the structure of the object. Conclusions:
We conclude that there is no single quantity in our analysis that can uniquely
trace the inclination and three-dimensional structure of a filament based on
dust observations alone. However, observing wide variations in total column
density at a given effective dust temperature is indicative of inclined
filaments.

Colorful Components (MCC) and Maximum Edges in transitive Closure (MEC),
introduced in 2011 in the context of orthology gene identification in
bioinformatics. The input of both MCC and MEC is a vertex-colored graph. MCC
asks for the removal of a subset of edges, so that the resulting graph is
partitioned in the minimum number of colorful connected components; MEC asks
for the removal of a subset of edges, so that the resulting graph is
partitioned in colorful connected components and the number of edges in the
transitive closure of such a graph is maximized. We study the parameterized and

  For MCC on trees we show that the problem is basically equivalent to Minimum
Cut on Trees, thus MCC is not approximable within factor $1.36 - \varepsilon$,
it is fixed-parameter tractable and it admits a poly-kernel (when the parameter
is the number of colorful components). Moreover, we show that MCC, while it is
polynomial time solvable on paths, it is NP-hard even for graphs with constant

complexity of MEC when parameterized by the number $k$ of edges in the

constructs into a coherent mesh of understanding of the world around us,
physics over its past five centuries has continuously refined the base concepts
on which the whole framework is built. In quantum physics, first in
non-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar
concepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from
the classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying
physics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or
an event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical
to it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of
underlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative
explanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and
incorrect physics.
  As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state,
physics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no
meaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of
any specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible
positions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the
distribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state. Physics
deals with the universal, not the individual.

structure presented in the text-books is a general method to write it, however,
not unique. The purpose of the present work is to show an alternative approach
to construct Dirac spinors, considering the interchange between the Lorentz
representation space (1/2,0) and (0,1/2) made by the ""Magic of Pauli matrices""
and not by parity, as commonly it was thought. As it is well known, parity
operator is related with the Dirac dynamics. The major focus is to establish
the relation between Dirac dynamics with parity operator, the reverse path
shown in L. D. Speran\c{c}a (2014).

  fractional mobile-immobile advection-dispersion model",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new numerical method based on the Chebyshev wavelets
(CWs) to solve the variable-order time fractional mobile-immobile
advection-dispersion equation. To do this, a new operational matrix of
variable-order fractional derivative in the Caputo sense for the CWs is derived
and is used to obtain an approximate solution for the problem under study.
Along the way a new family of piecewise functions is introduced and employed to
derive a general method to compute this matrix. The main advantage behind the
proposed approach is that the problem under consideration is transformed into a
linear system of algebraic equations. So, it can be solved simply to obtain an
approximate solution. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are
shown for some concrete examples. These results show that the proposed method
is very efficient and accurate.
