with number sequences that have been introduced and explored recently in the
context of graph-theoretical time series analysis. In most of the cases simple
measures based on the degree sequence (or functionals of these such as
entropies over degree and joint degree distributions) appear to be highly
informative features for automatic classification and provide nontrivial
information on the associated dynam- ical process, working even better than
more sophisticated topological metrics. It is thus an open question why these
seemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that,
under suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix
of an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such
bijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the
degree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby
giving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.

team leaders may rely on reference guides to direct and anticipate future
steps. However, guides often act as a fixation point, diverting the leader's
attention away from the team. To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative
study that evaluates a collaborative cognitive aid co-designed with clinicians
called Visual TASK. Our study explored the use of Visual TASK in three
simulations employing a projected shared display with two different interaction
modalities: the Microsoft Kinect and a touchscreen. Our results suggest that

are unsuitable for use in high-stress situations like resuscitation. We also
observed that fixation may not be constrained to reference guides alone, and
may extend to other objects in the room. We present our findings, and a
discussion regarding future avenues in which collaborative cognitive aids may

Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out and the behavior of pure

pure components: water (solvent) and solute, have quite similar phase diagrams,
presenting: gas, low density liquid, and high density liquid phases. In the
case of solute, the regions of coexistence are substantially reduced when
compared with both the water and the standard ALG models. A numerical procedure
has been developed in order to attain series of results at constant pressure

excess properties of the mixtures: volume and enthalpy as the function of the
solute fraction have been studied for different interaction parameters of the

enthalpy for different aqueous solutions. For the hydrophilic case, we show
that the model is able to reproduce the excess volume and enthalpy of mixtures

Furthermore, we find that the transition frequency is highly sensitive to the

similar to the prototype SN2007bi at maximum light, though lower in luminosity

four-dimensional vacua of string theory. Despite all their phenomenological
promise, there is little understanding of the metric on the moduli space of
these. What is sought is the analogue of special geometry for these vacua. The
metric on the moduli space is important in phenomenology as it normalises
D-terms and Yukawa couplings. It is also of interest in mathematics, since it
generalises the metric, first found by Kobayashi, on the space of gauge field
connections, to a more general context. Here we construct this metric, correct
to first order in alpha', in two ways: first by postulating a metric that is
invariant under background gauge transformations of the gauge field, and also
by dimensionally reducing heterotic supergravity. These methods agree and the
resulting metric is Kahler, as is required by supersymmetry. Checking that the
metric is in fact Kahler is quite intricate and uses the anomaly cancellation
equation for the H-field, in an essential way. The Kahler potential
nevertheless takes a remarkably simple form: it is Kahler potential for special
geometry with the Kahler form replaced by the alpha'-corrected hermitian form.

spectro-interferometric studies suggest a disk morphology for its environment.
We investigate the origin of the variability within the inner astronomical unit

PIONIER at the VLTI over a two-year period. We performed an image
reconstruction of the circumstellar environment using the SPARCO method. We
discovered that the morphology of the circumstellar environment could vary on
timescales of weeks or days. We carried out a parametric fit of the data with a
model consisting of a star, a disk and a bright spot that represents a brighter
emission in the disk. We detect strong morphological changes in the first
astronomical unit around the star, that happen on a timescale of few months. We
cannot account for such variability well with a binary model. Our parametric
model fits the data well and allows us to extract the location of the asymmetry
for different epochs. For the first time, we detect a morphological variability
in the environment of MWC158. This variability is reproduced by a model of a
disk and a bright spot. The locations of the bright spot suggest that it is
located in the disk, but its precise motion is not determined. The origin of
the asymmetry in the disk is complex and may be related to asymmetric shell
ejections.

allocating several such orthogonal sets to a single cell of a regular hexagonal

modification increases the number of users per cell by starting from shorter
codewords and then extending the length of these codewords to the desired
length. The specification and assignment of these orthogonal sets to a regular
tessellation of hexagonal cells have been solved regardless of the parity and
size of $m$ (where $2^m$ is the length of the codewords). In particular, when

(NVM), $q$-ary write-once memories (WOM) codes have been extensively studied.
By using WOM codes, it is possible to rewrite NVMs $t$ times before erasing the
cells. The use of WOM codes enables to improve the performance of the storage
device, however, it may also increase errors caused by inter-cell interference
(ICI). This work presents WOM codes that restrict the imbalance between code
symbols throughout the write sequence, hence decreasing ICI. We first specify
the imbalance model as a bound $d$ on the difference between codeword levels.
Then a $2$-cell code construction for general $q$ and input size is proposed.
An upper bound on the write count is also derived, showing the optimality of
the proposed construction. In addition to direct WOM constructions, we derive
closed-form optimal write regions for codes constructed with continuous
lattices. On the coding side, the proposed codes are shown to be competitive
with known codes not adhering to the bounded imbalance constraint. On the
memory side, we show how the codes can be deployed within flash wordlines, and
quantify their BER advantage using accepted ICI models.

flexibility of this approach to rescale the late-time linear power spectra to

the dynamics of the N-body code and the approximations it assumes. We implement
our method in a public code providing the initial displacements and velocities

stars with close-in super-Earth(s) ($\eta_\oplus$) is around $30 \%- 50\%$,

the fraction of solar-type stars harboring one or more gas giants ($\eta_J $)

appears to increase with both $M_\ast$ and $Z_\ast$. Regardless of the
properties of their host stars, the total mass of some multiple super-Earth
systems exceeds the core mass of Jupiter and Saturn. We suggest that both
super-Earths and supercritical cores of gas giants were assembled from a
population of embryos that underwent convergent type I migration from their
birthplaces to a transition location between viscously heated and irradiation
heated disk regions. We attribute the cause for the $\eta_\oplus$-$\eta_{\rm
J}$ dichotomy to conditions required for embryos to merge and to acquire
supercritical core mass ($M_c \sim 10 \ M_\oplus$) for the onset of efficient
gaseous envelope accretion. We translate this condition into a critical disk
accretion rate, and our analysis and simulation results show that it weakly
depends on $M_\ast$ and decreases with metallicity of disk gas $Z_{\rm d}$. We
find that embryos are more likely to merge into supercritical cores around
relatively massive and metal-rich stars. This dependence accounts for the
observed $\eta_{\rm J}$-$M_\ast$. We also consider the $Z_{\rm d}$-$Z_\ast$

efficiently approximates the solutions in low-rank tensor format. Using
standard Krylov subspace methods for the data in tensor format is
computationally prohibitive due to the rapid growth of tensor ranks during the
iterations. To keep tensor ranks low over the entire iteration process, we
devise a rank-reduction scheme that can be combined with the iterative
algorithm. The proposed rank-reduction scheme identifies an important subspace
in the stochastic domain and compresses tensors of high rank on-the-fly during
the iterations. The proposed reduction scheme is a multilevel method in that
the important subspace can be identified inexpensively in a coarse spatial grid

We propose to use a substitution variable in place of the latent membership in

substitution variable are conceptually similar to conditions for a conditional
instrumental variable, and may apply to both randomized and observational
studies. We show that the survivor average causal effect is identifiable with

fact that solutions contain regions where much higher resolution is required
than elsewhere in the domain, particularly since the solution may contain
discontinuities or other localized features. The Clawpack software deals with
this issue by using block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to selectively
refine around propagating waves. For problems where only a target area of the
total solution is of interest (e.g. one coastal community), a method that
allows identifying and refining the grid only in regions that influence this
target area would significantly reduce the computational cost of finding a
solution.
  In this work, we show that solving the time-dependent adjoint equation and
using a suitable inner product with the forward solution allows more precise
refinement of the relevant waves. We present examples solving the shallow water
equations in one and two dimensions. To perform these simulations, the use of
the adjoint method has been integrated into the adaptive mesh refinement
strategy of the open source GeoClaw software. We also present results that show
that the accuracy of the solution is maintained and the computational time
required is significantly reduced through the integration of the adjoint method
into adaptive mesh refinement.

responses, primarily varying with mass, from expansion to contraction, with up
to factor ~10 changes in the enclosed dark matter mass at one per cent of the
virial radius. Confirming previous studies, the halo response is correlated
with the integrated efficiency of star formation:
e_SF=(M_{star}/M_{200})/(\Omega_b/\Omega_m). In addition we report a new
correlation with the compactness of the stellar system: e_R=r_{1/2}/R_{200}. We
provide an analytic formula depending on e_SF and e_R for the response of cold
dark matter haloes to baryonic processes. An observationally testable
prediction is that, at fixed mass, larger galaxies experience more halo
expansion, while the smaller galaxies more halo contraction. This diversity of
dark halo response is captured by a toy model consisting of cycles of adiabatic
inflow (causing contraction) and impulsive gas outflow (causing expansion). For
net outflow, or equal inflow and outflow fractions, f, the overall effect is
expansion, with more expansion with larger f. For net inflow, contraction
occurs for small f (large radii), while expansion occurs for large f (small
radii), recovering the phenomenology seen in our simulations. These
regularities in the galaxy formation process provide a step towards a fully

radio quasar 3C 279 with a peak $>100$ MeV flux of $\sim3.6\times10^{-5}\;{\rm

It is the historically highest $\gamma$-ray flux observed from the source
including past EGRET observations, with the $\gamma$-ray isotropic luminosity

spacecraft, which has an orbital period of 95.4 min, was operated in a special
pointing mode to optimize the exposure for 3C 279. For the first time,
significant flux variability at sub-orbital timescales was found in blazar
observations by Fermi-LAT. The source flux variability was resolved down to
2-min binned timescales, with flux doubling times less than 5 min. The observed
minute-scale variability suggests a very compact emission region at hundreds of
Schwarzschild radii from the central engine in conical jet models. A minimum
bulk jet Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$) of 35 is necessary to avoid both internal
$\gamma$-ray absorption and super-Eddington jet power. In the standard
external-radiation-Comptonization scenario, $\Gamma$ should be at least 50 to
avoid overproducing the synchrotron-self-Compton component. However, this
predicts extremely low magnetization ($\sim5\times10^{-4}$). Equipartition
requires $\Gamma$ as high as 120, unless the emitting region is a small
fraction of the dissipation region. Alternatively, we consider $\gamma$ rays
originating as synchrotron radiation of $\gamma_{\rm e}\sim1.6\times10^6$

irregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging

of the size-luminosity relation at z ~ 7 that extends to M_UV ~ -23. We find
the relation to be steep with r_1/2 ~ L^1/2. Excluding clumpy, multi-component
galaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased
star-formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent,
HST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z ~ 7
favours a power-law decline at the bright-end, compared to an exponential

distribution of dark matter in galaxies. Recently, Di Cintio et al. (2014b)
characterized the halo response from baryonic processes in hydrodynamical
simulations via a dependence on the ratio of stellar-to-halo mass
($M_{\star}/M_{{\rm halo}}$). The (stellar) mass dependent halo profile links
together the local and global properties of the halo (e.g. inner slope and
$M_{{\rm halo}}$) which allows for measurements of $M_{{\rm halo}}$ without
virial tracers. We compile a large sample of rotation curves from the
literature to test this halo profile. We find that this halo profile can
explain rotation curve observations over a wide range of $M_{\star}$. However,
the global results from our sample are inconsistent with a $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter universe. We do not find the expected correlation between the halo
concentration and $M_{{\rm halo}}$ and there is significantly larger scatter
than expected. Furthermore, a large portion of galaxies below $M_{\star} \sim
10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ are found to be hosted by smaller halos than expectations
from the abundance matching technique. We find our results are robust to
statistical priors and systematic effects such as inclination angle, asymmetric
drift correction, data source, and uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light
ratios. This suggests either a mischaracterization of the halo response due to
baryonic processes or additional non-standard dark matter physics.

corrected source catalogs. We find that the high frequency radio galaxies are
centrally concentrated within the clusters and that their luminosity functions
(LFs) exhibit amplitudes that are characteristically an order of magnitude
lower than the cluster LF at 843 MHz. We use the 150 GHz LF to estimate the
impact of cluster radio galaxies on an SPT-SZ like survey. The radio galaxy
flux typically produces a small bias on the SZE signal and has negligible
impact on the observed scatter in the SZE mass-observable relation. If we

23.2 +- 1.0 AU. At this frequency the ring radius is smaller than in the
optical, revealing grain size segregation expected due to radiation pressure.
We also report on the detection of low level continuum emission beyond the main
ring out to ~200 AU. We model the CO emission in the non-LTE regime and we find
that the CO is co-located with the dust, with a total CO gas mass ranging
between 1.2x10^-6 Mearth and 2.9x10^-6 Mearth, depending on the gas kinetic
temperature and collisional partners densities. The CO densities and location
suggest a secondary origin, i.e. released from icy planetesimals in the ring.
We derive a CO+CO2 cometary composition that is consistent with Solar system
comets. Due to the low gas densities it is unlikely that the gas is shaping the

in canonical red giants including the accretion of a sub-stellar mass
companion. We consider a wide range of stellar and companion masses, Li
abundances, stellar metallicities, and planetary orbital periods. Based on our
calculations, companions with masses lower than 15 M_J dissolve in the
convective envelope and can induce Li enrichment in regimes where extra mixing
does not operate. Our models indicate that the accretion of a substellar
companion can explain abundances up to A(Li)~2.2, setting an upper limit for
Li-rich giants formed by this mechanism. Giants with higher abundances need
another mechanism to be explained. For reasonable planetary distributions, we
predict the Li abundance distribution of low-mass giants undergoing planet
engulfment, finding that between 1% to 3% of them should have A(Li)>1.5. We
show that depending on the stellar mass range, this traditional definition of
Li-rich giants is misleading, as isolated massive stars would be considered
anomalous while giants engulfing a companion would be set aside, flagged as
normal. We explore the detectability of companion engulfment, finding that
planets with masses higher than ~7 M_J produce a distinct signature, and that
descendants of stars originating in the Li-dip and low luminosity red giants

(trial- and time-averaged) in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL)
depends on the stimulus, and also that network inputs can mediate changes in
the firing rate distribution across the population. We previously developed
theoretical methods to understand how two attributes (synaptic and intrinsic
heterogeneity) interact and alter the firing rate distribution in a population
of integrate-and-fire neurons with random recurrent coupling. Inspired by our
experimental data, we extend these theoretical results to a delayed feedforward
spiking network that qualitatively capture the changes of firing rate
heterogeneity observed in in-vivo recordings. We demonstrate how heterogeneous
neural attributes alter firing rate heterogeneity, accounting for the effect
with various sensory stimuli. The model predicts how the strength of the
effective network connectivity is related to intrinsic heterogeneity in such
delayed feedforward networks: the strength of the feedforward input is
positively correlated with excitability (threshold value for spiking) with low
firing rate heterogeneity and is negatively correlated with excitability with
high firing rate heterogeneity. We also show how our theory can be use to
predict effective neural architecture. We demonstrate that neural attributes do
not interact in a simple manner but rather in a complex stimulus-dependent
fashion to control neural heterogeneity and discuss how it can ultimately shape
population codes.

similar total luminosity to that seen in BL Lacertae objects. M87 shows a
complicated emission line profile in Lya which varies spatially across the COS
aperture and possibly temporally over several epochs of observation. In both
NGC 4696 and M87, the Ly$\alpha$ luminosities $\sim 10^{40}$ ergs/s are closely
consistent with the observed strength of the ionizing continuum in Case B
recombination theory and with the assumption of near unity covering factor. It
is possible that the Ly$\alpha$ emitting clouds are ionized largely by beamed
radiation associated with the jets. Long-slit UV spectroscopy can be used to
test this hypothesis. Hydra A and the several BL Lac objects studied in this

extrapolated, non-thermal continua are so luminous that they over-predict the
observed strength of Ly$\alpha$, a clear indicator of relativistic beaming in
our direction. Given their substantial space density ($\sim 4\times10^{-3}

and related with the critical properties of its energy spectrum, namely the
quantum phase transitions (QPT) and excited state quantum phase transitions
(ESQPT). The thermal properties are calculated both in the canonical and the
microcanonical ensembles. The latter deduction allows for an explicit
description of the relation between thermal and energy spectrum properties.
While in an isolated system the subspaces with different pseudo spin are
disconnected, and the whole energy spectrum is accesible, in the thermal
ensamble the situation is radically different. The multiplicity of the lowest
energy states for each pseudo spin completely dominates the thermal behavior,
making the set of degenerate states with the smallest pseudo spin at a given
energy the only ones playing a role in the thermal properties, making the
positive energy states thermally inaccesible. Their quantum phase transitions,
from a normal to a superradiant phase, are closely associated with the thermal
transition. The other critical phenomena, the ESQPTs occurring at excited
energies, have no manifestation in the thermodynamics, although their effects
could be seen in finite sizes corrections. A new superradiant phase is found,
which only exists in the generalized model, and can be relevant in finite size
systems.

  workshop paper",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in
reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of
the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between
abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways
to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning algorithms. These structures
also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning
policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable
regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The
spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions
aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the
sequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. The
connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or
options. These skills are independent of the learning task and can be
efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. This
approach works well even without the exact model of the environment by using
sample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate. We also present our
approach to scaling the skill acquisition framework to complex tasks with large
state spaces for which we perform state aggregation using the representation
learned from an action conditional video prediction network and use the skill
acquisition framework on the aggregated state space.

such a framework can be useful in a variety of problems such as robotic path

modelling. All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative
integer vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix
corresponding to a biochemical network. Algorithms exist to compute such
vectors based only on reaction stoichiometry but their computational complexity
has limited their application to relatively small metabolic networks. Moreover,
the vectors returned by existing algorithms do not, in general, represent
conservation of a specific moiety with a defined atomic structure. Here, we
show that identification of conserved moieties requires data on reaction atom
mappings in addition to stoichiometry. We present a novel method to identify
conserved moieties in metabolic networks by graph theoretical analysis of their
underlying atom transition networks. Our method returns the exact group of
atoms belonging to each conserved moiety as well as the corresponding vector in
the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix. It can be implemented as a
pipeline of polynomial time algorithms. Our implementation completes in under
five minutes on a metabolic network with more than 4,000 mass balanced

applications for moiety conservation relations to genome-scale metabolic
networks. We also give examples of new applications made possible by

physically-plausible reionisation histories. We study the impact of various EoR

the dark fraction in the Lyman $\alpha$ and $\beta$ forests; (iii) the redshift
evolution of galactic Ly$\alpha$ emission (so-called ""Ly$\alpha$ fraction"");
(iv) the clustering of Ly$\alpha$ emitters; (v) the IGM damping wing imprint in

constraints on the reionisation history, with the epochs corresponding to an
average neutral fraction of (75, 50, 25) per cent, constrained at 1$\sigma$ to

[(iii--vi)], strengthens these constraints by tens of per cent, at the cost of
a decrease in the likelihood of the best-fit model, driven mostly by (iii). The
tightest constraints come from (v). Unfortunately, no current observational set
is sufficient to break degeneracies and constrain the astrophysical EoR
parameters. However, model-dependent priors on the EoR parameters themselves
can be used to set tight limits by excluding regions of parameter space with
strong degeneracies. Motivated by recent observations of $z\sim7$ faint, lensed

interfaces separating identical materials are traditionally assumed not to

n$, we define $\tau_{m,n,k}$ to be the set of $m\times n$ matrices over $K$
with kernel dimension $\geq k$. This is a projective subvariety of
$\bbP^{mn-1}$, and is called the (generic) determinantal variety. In most cases
$\tau_{m,n,k}$ is singular with singular locus $\tau_{m,n,k+1}$. In this paper
we give explicit formulas computing the Chern-Mather class ($c_M$) and the
Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class ($c_{SM}$) of $\tau_{m,n,k}$, as classes in the
projective space. We also obtain formulas for the conormal cycles and the
characteristic cycles of these varieties, and for their generic Euclidean
Distance degree. Further, when $K=\bbC$, we prove that the characteristic cycle
of the intersection cohomology sheaf of a determinantal variety agrees with its
conormal cycle (and hence is irreducible).
  Our formulas are based on calculations of degrees of certain Chern classes of
the universal bundles over the Grassmannian. For some small values of $m,n,k$,
we use Macaulay2 to exhibit examples of the Chern-Mather classes, the
Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes and the classes of characteristic cycles of

  On the basis of explicit computations in low dimensions, we formulate
conjectures concerning the effectivity of the classes and the vanishing of

  The irreducibility of the characteristic cycle of the intersection cohomology

""anomalous"" liquid. The water anomalies are greatly amplified in metastable
(supercooled/stretched) regions. This makes difficult a complete experimental
description since, beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily
transforms into the stable one. Theoretical interpretation of the water
anomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water
models. But the analysis of the simulations has not yet reached a consensus. In
particular, one of the most popular theoretical scenarios -involving the
existence of a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP)- is disputed by several
authors. In this work we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic
relations which can be tested in a region of the phase diagram outside the LLCP
thus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region. The central
property connected to other water anomalies is the locus of temperatures at
which the density along isobars attain a maximum (TMD line) or a minimum (TmD),
computed via simulations for a successful water model, TIP4P/2005. Next, we
have evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative
pressures. The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of
response functions (isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant
pressure) may help to elucidate the validity of the theoretical proposals. In
this way we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of
the thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the
vapor-liquid spinodal. The overall picture shows a remarkable similarity with
the corresponding one for the ST2 water model, for which the existence of a
LLCP has been demonstrated in recent years. It also provides a hint as to where
the long-sought for extrema in response functions might become accessible to
experiments.

equation that is both globally conservative and compatible with voids, using
Continuous Finite Element Methods (CFEM). The main idea is to use the
Least-Squares (LS) form of the transport equation in the void regions and the
Self-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) form elsewhere. While the SAAF formulation is
globally conservative, the LS formulation need a correction in void. The price
to pay for this fix is the loss of symmetry of the bilinear form. We first
derive this Conservative LS (CLS) formulation in void. Second we combine the
SAAF and CLS forms and end up with an hybrid SAAF-CLS method, having the
desired properties. We show that extending the theory to near-void regions is a
minor complication and can be done without affecting the global conservation of
the scheme. Being angular discretization agnostic, this method can be applied
to both discrete ordinates (SN) and spherical harmonics (PN) methods. However,
since a globally conservative and void compatible second-order form already
exists for SN (Wang et al. 2014), but is believed to be new for PN, we focus
most of our attention on that latter angular discretization. We implement and
test our method in Rattlesnake within the Multiphysics Object Oriented
Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Results comparing it to other methods

black hole at the center of our Galaxy, arises from the innermost portions of
the accretion flow. Better characterization of the variability is important for
constraining models of the low-luminosity accretion mode powering Sgr~A*, and
could further our ability to use variable emission as a probe of the strong
gravitational potential in the vicinity of the
$4\times10^{6}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ black hole. We use the \textit{Herschel}
Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) to monitor Sgr~A* at
wavelengths that are difficult or impossible to observe from the ground. We
find highly significant variations at 0.25, 0.35, and 0.5 mm, with temporal
structure that is highly correlated across these wavelengths. While the
variations correspond to $<$1% changes in the total intensity in the
\textit{Herschel} beam containing Sgr~A*, comparison to independent,
simultaneous observations at 0.85 mm strongly supports the reality of the
variations. The lowest point in the light curves, $\sim$0.5 Jy below the
time-averaged flux density, places a lower bound on the emission of Sgr~A* at
0.25 mm, the first such constraint on the THz portion of the SED. The
variability on few hour timescales in the SPIRE light curves is similar to that
seen in historical 1.3 mm data, where the longest time series is available, but
the distribution of variations in the sub-mm do not show a tail of
large-amplitude variations seen at 1.3 mm. Simultaneous X-ray photometry from
XMM-Newton shows no significant variation within our observing period, which
may explain the lack of very large variations if X-ray and submillimeter flares
are correlated.

strong DC electric field led to gradual and reproducible surface modifications.
By a combination of field emission microscopy and scanning electron microscopy,
we observed asymmetric surface faceting with sub-ten nanometer high steps. The
presence of well pronounced faceted features mainly on the laser-exposed side
implies that the surface modification was driven by a laser-induced transient
temperature rise -- on a scale of a couple of picoseconds -- in the tungsten
tip apex. Moreover, we identified the formation of a nano-tip a few nanometers
high located at one of the corners of a faceted plateau. The results of
simulations emulating the experimental conditions, are consistent with the
experimental observations. The presented conditions can be used as a new method
to fabricate nano-tips of few nm height, which can be used in coherent electron
pulses generation. Besides the direct practical application, the results also
provide insight into the microscopic mechanisms of light-matter interaction.
The apparent growth mechanism of the features may also help to explain the
origin of enhanced electron field emission, which leads to vacuum arcs, in high
electric-field devices such as radio-frequency particle accelerators.

solution for automatic facial attribute extraction by training a deep

without using any pre-training or dataset augmentation, and we obtain new
state-of-the-art facial attribute classification results on the CelebA
benchmark. To test the stability of the networks, we generated adversarial
images -- formed by adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to original
inputs which result in classification errors -- via a novel fast flipping
attribute (FFA) technique. We show that FFA generates more adversarial examples
than other related algorithms, and that DCNNs for certain attributes are
generally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNs for other attributes are
not. This result is surprising because no DCNNs tested to date have exhibited
robustness to adversarial images without explicit augmentation in the training
procedure to account for adversarial examples. Finally, we introduce the
concept of natural adversarial samples, i.e., images that are misclassified but
can be easily turned into correctly classified images by applying small
perturbations. We demonstrate that natural adversarial samples commonly occur,
even within the training set, and show that many of these images remain
misclassified even with additional training epochs. This phenomenon is
surprising because correcting the misclassification, particularly when guided

distributed storage systems transitioning to erasure coding based schemes. Yet,
the codes being deployed in practice are fairly short. In this work, we address
what we view as the main coding theoretic barrier to deploying longer codes in
storage: at large lengths, failures are not independent and correlated failures
are inevitable. This motivates designing codes that allow quick data recovery
even after large correlated failures, and which have efficient encoding and
decoding. We propose that code design for distributed storage be viewed as a
two-step process. The first step is choose a topology of the code, which
incorporates knowledge about the correlated failures that need to be handled,
and ensures local recovery from such failures. In the second step one specifies
a code with the chosen topology by choosing coefficients from a finite field.
In this step, one tries to balance reliability (which is better over larger
fields) with encoding and decoding efficiency (which is better over smaller
fields). This work initiates an in-depth study of this reliability/efficiency
tradeoff. We consider the field-size needed for achieving maximal
recoverability: the strongest reliability possible with a given topology. We
propose a family of topologies called grid-like topologies which unify a number
of topologies considered both in theory and practice, and prove a collection of
results about maximally recoverable codes in such topologies including the
first super-polynomial lower bound on the field size.

algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal
array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics;

structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular
assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of

The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most
indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become
a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its
straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first
language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming,

We show that employing sparse representations provides more accurate ODE
reconstruction compared to least-squares reconstruction techniques for a given
amount of time series data. We test and validate the ODE reconstruction method
on known 1D, 2D, and 3D systems of ODEs. The 1D system possesses two stable
fixed points; the 2D system possesses an oscillatory fixed point with closed
orbits; and the 3D system displays chaotic dynamics on a strange attractor. We
determine the amount of data required to achieve an error in the reconstructed
functions to less than $0.1\%$. For the reconstructed 1D and 2D systems, we are
able to match the trajectories from the original ODEs even at long times. For
the 3D system with chaotic dynamics, as expected, the trajectories from the
original and reconstructed systems do not match at long times, but the
reconstructed and original models possess similar Lyapunov exponents. Now that
we have validated this ODE reconstruction method on known models, it can be
employed in future studies to identify new systems of ODEs using time series
data from deterministic systems for which there is no currently known ODE
model.

formulas of multiple products, on the basis of historical data, which reveal
complex relationships between sales and prices, such as price elasticity of
demand and cannibalization. Then, it constructs a mathematical optimization
problem on the basis of those predictive formulas. We present that the
optimization problem can be formulated as an instance of binary quadratic

computationally intractable, we propose a fast approximation algorithm using a
semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation, which is closely related to the
Goemans-Williamson's Max-Cut approximation. Our experiments on simulation and

simultaneously derives the optimal prices of tens/hundreds products with

resonant cavity structure in the presence of a static magnetic field, where the
generated photon frequency corresponds to the mass of the axion. For maximum
sensitivity it is key that the central frequency of the cavity mode structure

guaranteeing that the output of the consensus is agreed upon with high
probability. However, this probability depends on the delivery of messages and
that the computational power of the system is sufficiently scattered among
pools of nodes in the network so that no pool can mine more blocks faster than
the crowd. New approaches, like Ethereum, generalise the proof-of-work approach
by letting individuals deploy their own private blockchain with high
transaction throughput. As companies are starting to deploy private chains, it
has become crucial to better understand the guarantees blockchains offer in
such a small and controlled environment.
  In this paper, we present the \emph{Blockchain Anomaly}, an execution that we
experienced when building our private chain at NICTA/Data61. Even though this
anomaly has never been acknowledged before, it may translate into dramatic
consequences for the user of blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos
anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like ""Bob sends money to
Carole after he received money from Alice"" impossible. This anomaly relies on
the fact that existing blockchains do not ensure consensus safety
deterministically: there is no way for Bob to make sure that Alice actually
sent him coins without Bob using an external mechanism, like converting these
coins into a fiat currency that allows him to withdraw. We also explore smart
contracts as a potential alternative to transactions in order to freeze coins,
and show implementations of smart contract that can suffer from the Blockchain

basic and applied studies. The manuscript highlights the general regularities
in a field on the grounds of strong interrelation between catalytic, kinetic
and thermodynamic behaviour of the reaction system. The trials of the catalytic
NH3 synthesis and the oscillatory NO+H2 reaction have revealed that the
thermodynamics of the local structure determines the properties and
multiplicity of the reaction intermediates enabling the peculiar macroscopic
kinetics and specific catalytic activity. Structure and activity of catalytic
sites are correlated within a realistic model, where total undercoordination of
adjacent surface atoms and enthalpy of local reaction is taken as a descriptor
for structure and activity, respectively. The model has specified the resonant
catalytic centers for NH3 synthesis on metal surfaces in close agreement with
experimental data. The basal planes of noble metals are less active than Fe-
and Ru-based catalysts, whereas an extraordinary activity of small Pt, Ir and
Rh clusters can be expected. A strong advantage of imperfections compared to
perfect areas in the surface wave nucleation is evaluated. Isothermal rate
oscillations in open heterogeneous catalytic reaction systems are expected
under the multiplicity of reaction intermediates fairly different in activity,
providing the steady state and reaction rout multiplicity. Switching between
active and inactive kinetic brunches gives rise to the explosive coverage
changeover that can be visualized as a traveling wave. A single pattern of
oscillations in the NO+H2 reaction includes the key role of intermediate NHad
species providing the catalytic removal of strongly bound nitrogen. The driving
forces, the feedback, and chemical interactions within the traveling waves are
clearly understood.

factors: whether the influence of the initial failures in $\alpha$ remains
(quenched (Case Q)) or not (free (Case F)); the effect of intralayer
degree-degree correlations in each layer and interlayer degree-degree
correlations; and the type of the initial failures, such as random failures
(RFs) or targeted attacks (TAs). We illustrate that the percolation processes
repeat in both Cases Q and F, although only in Case F are nodes that initially
failed reactivated. To analytically evaluate the resilience of each layer, we
develop a methodology based on the cavity method for deriving the size of a
giant component (GC). Strong hysteresis, which is ignored in the standard
cavity analysis, is observed in the repetition of the percolation processes
particularly in Case F. To handle this, we heuristically modify interlayer
messages for macroscopic analysis, the utility of which is verified by
numerical experiments. The percolation transition in each layer is continuous
in both Cases Q and F. We also analyze the influences of degree-degree
correlations on the robustness of layer $\alpha$, in particular for the case of
TAs. The analysis indicates that the critical fraction of initial failures that
makes the GC size in layer $\alpha$ vanish depends only on its intralayer
degree-degree correlations. Although our model is defined in a somewhat
abstract manner, it may have relevance to ecological systems that are composed
of endangered species (layer $\alpha$) and invaders (layer $\beta$), the former

significant detection by the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS around the time of GW150914-GBM,
a great debate has been raised about whether GW150914-GBM is of astrophysical
origin and associated with the GW150914 (Savchenko et al. 2016). In order to
answer this question, we re-analyzed the GBM data with a straightforward but

those detectors with bad viewing angles to the GW event, whereas the good
viewing detectors see nothing significant beyond background fluctuation around
the trigger time of GW150914. This finding suggests that GW150914-GBM is very

Model in the Strong and Electroweak sectors play an important role. Because of
nature of the proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of
the direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures. In the
present paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of Drell-Yan process
leptons, in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the intermediate
state imposes that distributions are to a good precision described by spherical
polynomials of at most second order.
  We show that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one
coefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the
presence of one or two high $p_T$ jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the
frames relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants.
  This remains true when one or two partons accompany the lepton pairs. In this
way electroweak effects can be better separated from strong interaction ones
for the benefit of the interpretation of the measurements.
  Our study exploits properties of single gluon emission matrix elements which
are clearly visible if a conveniently chosen form of their representation is
used. We rely also on distributions obtained from matrix element based Monte
Carlo generated samples of events with two leptons and up to two additional
partons in test samples. Incoming colliding protons' partons are distributed
accordingly to PDFs and are strictly collinear to the corresponding beams.

a periodic radial-velocity signal (P~400 days) from the K-giant binary nu
Octantis (P~1050 days, e~0.25), alternatively conjectured to have a retrograde
planet. Our study is based on temperatures derived from 22 line-depth ratios
(LDRs) for nu Oct and twenty calibration stars. Empirical evidence and
stability modelling provide unexpected support for the planet since other
standard explanations (star-spots, pulsations and additional stellar masses)
each have credibility problems. However, the proposed system presents
formidable challenges to planet-formation and stability theories: it has by far
the smallest stellar separation of any claimed planet-harbouring binary
(a_bin~2.6 au) and an equally unbelievable separation ratio (a_pl/a_bin~0.5),
hence the necessity that the circumstellar orbit be retrograde.
  The LDR analysis of 215 nu Oct spectra acquired between 2001--2007, from
which the RV perturbation was first revealed, have no significant periodicity
at any frequency. The LDRs recover the original 21 stellar temperatures with an
average accuracy of 45+/-25 K. The 215 nu Oct temperatures have a standard
deviation of only 4.2 K. Assuming the host primary is not pulsating, the
temperatures converted to magnitude differences strikingly mimic the very
stable photometric Hipparcos observations 15 years previously, implying the
long-term stability of the star and demonstrating a novel use of LDRs as a
photometric gauge. Our results provide substantial new evidence that
conventional star-spots and pulsations are unlikely causes of the RV
perturbation. The controversial system deserves continued attention, including
with higher resolving-power spectra for bisector and LDR analyses.

networks (CNN), using contextual information with such systems starts to
receive attention in the literature. At the same time, aerial imagery is
gaining momentum. While advances in deep learning make good progress in aerial
image analysis, this problem still poses many great challenges. Aerial images
are often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolution
objects, many times occluded by trees or taller buildings. In this domain, in
particular, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few
papers that consider context in aerial image understanding. Here we introduce
context as a complementary way of recognizing objects. We propose a dual-stream
deep neural network model that processes information along two independent
pathways, one for local and another for global visual reasoning. The two are
later combined in the final layers of processing. Our model learns to combine
local object appearance as well as information from the larger scene at the

space- and ground-based $\gamma$-ray facilities. However, whether $\gamma$-rays
come from accelerated hadrons or not, as well as their connection with the CRs
observed at Earth, remains in debate. Large High Altitude Air Shower

northern part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray sky from $\sim 0.3$ TeV to

In particular, its linear convergence rate has been studied by Rockafellar in

the condition proposed by Rockafellar can also sufficiently ensure the linear
convergence rate for this generalized PPA. Indeed we show that these linear
convergence rates are optimal. Both the exact and inexact versions of this
generalized PPA are discussed. The motivation to consider this generalized PPA
is that it includes as special cases the relaxed versions of some splitting
methods that are originated from PPA. Thus, linear convergence results of this
generalized PPA can be used to better understand the convergence of some widely
used algorithms in the literature. We focus on the particular convex
minimization context and specify Rockafellar's condition to see how to ensure
the linear convergence rate for some efficient numerical schemes, including the
classical augmented Lagrangian method proposed by Hensen and Powell in 1969 and
its relaxed version, the original alternating direction method of multipliers

models with higher and higher resolution, which brings new challenges for data
assimilation techniques because of the presence of non-linear and non-Gaussian

localized algorithms based on the Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter (EnKPF), a
hybrid method combining the EnKF and the Particle Filter (PF) in a way that

the success of EnKFs in practice, but it is much more challenging to apply to
PFs. The algorithms that we introduce in the present paper provide a compromise
between the EnKF and the PF while avoiding some of the problems of localization
for pure PFs. Numerical experiments with a simplified model of cumulus
convection based on a modified shallow water equation show that the proposed
algorithms perform better than the local EnKF. In particular, the PF nature of
the method allows to capture non-Gaussian characteristics of the estimated

the determination of the original signal is generally challenging. Although
there are many approaches in the literature to incorporate the assumption of
non-negativity of the solution into numerical algorithms, theoretical

whether the usually applied a priori non-negativity can overcame the
ambiguousness of the phase retrieval problem or not. We show that the assumed

signatures of multiband superconductivity are observed with no evidence for

ever-increasing computation demands from mobile applications. By offloading the
computationally intensive workloads to the MEC server, the quality of
computation experience, e.g., the execution latency, could be greatly improved.
Nevertheless, as the on-device battery capacities are limited, computation
would be interrupted when the battery energy runs out. To provide satisfactory
computation performance as well as achieving green computing, it is of
significant importance to seek renewable energy sources to power mobile devices
via energy harvesting (EH) technologies. In this paper, we will investigate a
green MEC system with EH devices and develop an effective computation
offloading strategy. The execution cost, which addresses both the execution
latency and task failure, is adopted as the performance metric. A
low-complexity online algorithm, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based
dynamic computation offloading (LODCO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly
decides the offloading decision, the CPU-cycle frequencies for mobile
execution, and the transmit power for computation offloading. A unique
advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the
instantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of
the computation task request, the wireless channel, and EH processes. The
implementation of the algorithm only requires to solve a deterministic problem
in each time slot, for which the optimal solution can be obtained either in
closed form or by bisection search. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown
to be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Sample simulation results
shall be presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate the

of a Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) with an optical readout for a 3 units
(3U) spacecraft. A purely drag-free object is defined by the absence of all
external forces other than gravity, which are shielded by the spacecraft. In a
real case, the TM will still be affected by disturbances. Several of them are
passively reduced by the design of the TM housing. This system is a
thick-walled aluminium box that holds the shadow sensors and shields the TM.
The housing has an effect on the mechanical, thermal and magnetic environment
around the TM. All of them have been analysed. The mechanical vibrations have
to fit the launch environment and the modes have to be outside of the
measurement range (0.0001 - 1 Hz). The magnetic field has to be reduced by a
0.01 factor. The temperature difference between internal opposing surfaces,
determining pressure on the TM, has to be below 10^-3(1 mHz/f)1/3 K Hz^-1/2.
The housing, together with the TM, the sensors and the UV LEDs for charging
control, constitutes the GRS, which would then fit into a 1U. The other 2Us are
occupied by the caging mechanism that constraints the TM during launch, the
thrusters, the Attitude Determination And Control System (ADACS) and the
electronics. The Drag-Free CubeSat will be the result of the combined efforts
of Stanford, University of Florida, KACST and NASA and will be the first
drag-free mission with an optical readout and the first GRS designed within the
limits of a 3U small satellite. In the first section, this paper briefly
updates on the main characteristics and systems of the project. Particular

structural parameters are measured by fitting S\'ersic profiles to $i$-band
images and then combined with absolute magnitudes, colours and redshifts, to
trace the evolution in a multi-parameter space. We analyse, using a new method,
the combination of colours and structural parameters of early- and late-type
galaxies in luminosity--redshift space. We found that both the rest-frame
colour distributions in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane and the S\'ersic index
distributions are well fitted by a sum of two Gaussians, with a remarkable
consistency of red-spheroidal and blue-disky galaxy populations, over the
explored redshift ($0.5<z<1$) and luminosity ($-1.5<B-B_*<1.0$) ranges. The
combination of the UBV rest-frame colour and S\'ersic index $n$ as a function
of redshift and luminosity allows us to present the structure of early- and
late-type galaxies and their evolution. We found that early type galaxies
display only a slow change of their concentrations since $z\sim1$; it is
already established by $z\sim1$ and depends much more strongly on their
luminosities. In contrast, late-type galaxies get clearly more concentrated
with cosmic time since $z\sim1$, with only little evolution in colour, which
remains dependent mainly on their luminosity. This flipped luminosity (mass)
and redshift dependence likely reflects different evolutionary tracks of early-
and late-type galaxies before and after $z\sim1$. The combination of rest-frame
colours and S\'ersic index $n$ as a function of redshift and luminosity leads
to a precise statistical description of the structure of galaxies and their
evolution.

using a subset of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). We
extracted from the VIPERS survey a sample of passive galaxies in the redshift
range 0.4<z<1.0 and stellar mass range 10<$log(M_{star}/M_{\odot})$<12. The
sample was selected using an evolving cut in the rest-frame U-V color
distribution and additional quality-ensuring cuts. We use the stacked spectra
to measure the 4000$\AA$ break (D4000) and the $H\delta$ Lick index
($H\delta_{A}$) with high precision. We compare the results with a grid of
synthetic spectra to constrain the star formation epochs of these galaxies. We
characterize the formation redshift-stellar mass relation for
intermediate-redshift passive galaxies. We find that at $z\sim1$ stellar
populations in low-mass passive galaxies are younger than in high-mass passive
galaxies, similarly to what is observed at the present epoch. Over the full
analyzed redshift and stellar mass range, the $D4000$ index increases with
redshift, while $H\delta_{A}$ gets lower. This implies that the stellar
populations are getting older with increasing stellar mass. Comparison to the
spectra of passive galaxies in the SDSS survey shows that the shape of the
relations of $D4000$, and $H\delta_{A}$ with stellar mass has not changed
significantly with redshift. Assuming a single burst formation, this implies
that high-mass passive galaxies formed their stars at $z_{form}\sim2$, while
low-mass galaxies formed their main stellar population more recently, at
$z_{form}\sim1$. The consistency of these results, obtained using two
independent estimator of the formation redshift ($D4000$ and $H\delta_{A}$),
further strengthens a scenario in which star formation proceeds from higher- to
lower-mass systems as time passes, i.e. what has become known as the
'downsizing' picture.

second-epoch observations in cntH$\alpha$, we are able to see variability on
the stellar photosphere. We find that in the first epoch the surface brightness
of R Dor is asymmetric in V and cntH$\alpha$, the filters where molecular
opacity is stronger, while in cnt820 the surface brightness is closer to being
axisymmetric. The second-epoch observations in cntH$\alpha$ show that the
morphology of R Dor changes completely in a timespan of 48 days to a more
axisymmetric and compact configuration. The polarised intensity is asymmetric
in all epochs and varies by between a factor of 2.3 and 3.7 with azimuth for
the different images. We fit the radial profile of the polarised intensity
using a spherically symmetric model and a parametric description of the dust
density profile, $\rho(r)=\rho_\circ r^{-n}$. On average, we find exponents of
$- 4.5 \pm 0.5$ that correspond to a much steeper density profile than that of
a wind expanding at constant velocity. The dust densities we derive imply an
upper limit for the dust-to-gas ratio of $\sim 2\times10^{-4}$ at 5.0
$R_\star$. Given the uncertainties in observations and models, this value is
consistent with the minimum values required by wind-driving models for the
onset of a wind, of $\sim 3.3\times10^{-4}$. However, if the steep density
profile we find extends to larger distances from the star, the dust-to-gas
ratio will quickly become too small for the wind of R Dor to be driven by the
grains that produce the scattered light.

Width-Luminosity Relation (WLR) than previously suggested, and there is
evidence for luminous SNe Ia with large $\Delta m_{15}(B)$. We find a bimodal
distribution in $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, with a pronounced lack of transitional
events at $\Delta m_{15}(B)$=1.6 mag. We confirm that faster, low-luminosity
SNe tend to come from passive galaxies. Dividing the sample by host galaxy
type, SNe Ia from star-forming (S-F) galaxies have a mean $M_{B}=-19.20 \pm
0.05$ mag, while SNe Ia from passive galaxies have a mean $M_{B}=-18.57 \pm
0.24$ mag. Even excluding fast declining SNe, `normal' ($M_{B}<-18$ mag) SNe Ia
from S-F and passive galaxies are distinct. In the $V$-band, there is a
difference of 0.4$ \pm $0.13 mag between the median ($M_{V}$) values of the
`normal' SN Ia population from passive and S-F galaxies. This is consistent
with ($\sim 15 \pm $10)% of `normal' SNe Ia from S-F galaxies coming from an
old stellar population.

limits but still obtain Moore's Law performance/price gains, it will be
necessary to parallelize algorithms to exploit larger numbers of lightweight
cores and specialized functions like large vector units. Track finding and
fitting is one of the most computationally challenging problems for event
reconstruction in particle physics. At the High-Luminosity Large Hadron
Collider (HL-LHC), for example, this will be by far the dominant problem. The
need for greater parallelism has driven investigations of very different track
finding techniques such as Cellular Automata or Hough Transforms. The most
common track finding techniques in use today, however, are those based on the
Kalman Filter. Significant experience has been accumulated with these
techniques on real tracking detector systems, both in the trigger and offline.
They are known to provide high physics performance, are robust, and are in use
today at the LHC. We report on porting these algorithms to new parallel
architectures. Our previous investigations showed that, using optimized data
structures, track fitting with a Kalman Filter can achieve large speedups both
with Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi. Additionally, we have previously shown first
attempts at track building with some speedup. We report here our progress

neurons throughout the different layers. However, neither two of these
assumptions can be supposed optimal in practice. In this paper, we present a
principled way to have data-dependent adaptation of the activation functions,
which is performed independently for each neuron. This is achieved by
leveraging over past and present advances on cubic spline interpolation,
allowing for local adaptation of the functions around their regions of use. The
resulting algorithm is relatively cheap to implement, and overfitting is
counterbalanced by the inclusion of a novel damping criterion, which penalizes
unwanted oscillations from a predefined shape. Experimental results validate
the proposal over two well-known benchmarks.

our best-fit N-body simulation does display real projected density variations
linked to stellar epicyclic motions, but these become less significant when
taking into account the SDSS star-count constraints. The substructures found

mmWave communications but among them deafness, or misalignment between

prominent ones. In the recent years, scenarios considering negligible
interference on mmWave resource allocation have been rather common in
literature. To this end, interestingly, many open issues still need to be
addressed such as the applicability of noise-limited regime for mmWave.
Furthermore, in mmWave the beam-steering mechanism imposes a forced silence
period, in the course of which no data can be conveyed, that should not be
neglected in throughput/delay calculations. This paper introduces mmWave

further elaborates on the off-balancing impact of alignment delay and

increasing the number of transmitters produces in the regime of a fixed-node

with powerful relativistic jets ($L_{1.4GHz} >10^{27}$ WHz$^{-1}$), previously
classified as flat-spectrum radio quasars. We also compile host galaxy and
nuclear magnitudes for blazars from literature. The combined sample (this work
and compilation) contains 100 radio-loud AGN with host galaxy detections and a
broad range of radio luminosities $L_{1.4GHz} \sim 10^{23.7} -
10^{28.3}$~WHz$^{-1}$, allowing us to divide our sample into high-luminosity
blazars (HLBs) and low-luminosity blazars (LLBs). The host galaxies of our
sample are bright and seem to follow the $\mu_{e}$-$R_{eff}$ relation for
ellipticals and bulges. The two populations of blazars show different
behaviours in the \mnuc - \mbulge plane, where a statistically significant
correlation is observed for HLBs. Although it may be affected by selection
effects, this correlation suggests a close coupling between the accretion mode
of the central supermassive black hole and its host galaxy, that could be
interpreted in terms of AGN feedback. Our findings are consistent with
semi--analytical models where low--luminosity AGN emit the bulk of their energy
in the form of radio jets, producing a strong feedback mechanism, and
high--luminosity AGN are affected by galaxy mergers and interactions, which
provide a common supply of cold gas to feed both nuclear activity and star
formation episodes.

regular and chaotic) on nematic liquid crystals in a planar geometry. The
Landau--de Gennes equation coupled to an externally-prescribed flow field is
the basis for the study: this is solved numerically in a periodic spatial
domain. The focus is on a limiting case where the advection is passive, such
that variations in the liquid-crystal properties do not feed back into the
equation for the fluid velocity. The main tool for analyzing the results (both
with and without flow) is the identification of the fixed points of the
dynamical equations without flow, which are relevant (to varying degrees) when
flow is introduced. The fixed points are classified as stable/unstable and
further as either uniaxial or biaxial. Accordingly, various models of passive
shear flow are investigated, with the main focus being on the case where
tumbling is absent from the model. In this scenario, not only must advection of
the $Q$-tensor be considered, but also its co-rotation relative to the local
vorticity field. Thus, only the biaxial fixed point survives as a solution of
the $Q$-tensor dynamics under the imposition of a general flow field. For
certain flows for which co-rotation effects can effectively be ignored along
trajectories, both families of fixed points survive. In this scenario, the
system exhibits coarsening arrest, whereby the liquid-crystal domains are
`frozen in' to the flow structures and the growth in their size is thus
limited. The outcome (biaxial final state or a mixture of both families of
fixed points) can be understood in terms of the flow time- and length-scales
that manifest themselves through the co-rotational derivative. Some
consideration is also given to the specific case where tumbling is present;
here, the flow has a strong effect on the liquid-crystal morphology.

with the introduction of power efficient wireless communication technologies,

to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build
entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to
facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a

user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of
people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the
received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning
of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving
seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate
the use of a seamful approach, i.e. to reveal and exploit these problems and
turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the
viability of this approach, we designed, implemented and evaluated the Ghost

presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design

(RHESSI) satellite. Since the occurrence of these events in the Mediterranean
region is quite rare, the characterisation of the events was optimised by
combining different approaches in order to better define the cloud of origin.
The TGFs on 7 November 2004 and 16 October 2006 came from clouds with cloud top
higher than 10-12 km where often a strong penetration into the stratosphere is
found. This kind of cloud is usually associated with heavy precipitation and
intense lightning activity. Nevertheless, the analysis of the cloud type based
on satellite retrievals shows that the TGF on 27 May 2004 was produced by an
unusual shallow convection. This result appears to be supported by the model
simulation of the particle distribution and phase in the upper troposphere. The
TGF on 7 November 2004 is among the brightest ever measured by RHESSI. The
analysis of the energy spectrum of this event is consistent with a production
altitude $\leq$12 km, which is in the upper part of the cloud, as found by the
meteorological analysis of the TGF-producing thunderstorm. This event must be
unusually bright at the source in order to produce such a strong signal in
RHESSI. We estimate that this TGF must contain $\sim$3x10$\rm ^{18}$ initial
photons with energy $>$1 MeV. This is 1 order of magnitude brighter than
earlier estimations of an average RHESSI TGF.

characteristics, such as the largest Lyapunov exponent is non-positive. Here we
study, how such a divergence can be exposed and detected. First, we show that
weak transient chaos can be exposed if a small random perturbation is added to
the system, leading to positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponent.
Second, we introduce an alternative definition of the Lyapunov exponent, which
allows us to detect weak transient chaos in the deterministic unperturbed
system. We show that this novel characteristic becomes positive, reflecting
transient chaos. We demonstrate this phenomenon and its detection using a
master-slave system where the master possesses a heteroclinic cycle attractor,
while the slave is the Van-der-Pol-Duffing oscillator possessing a stable limit
cycle.

Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100036).
Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has grown into a standard methodology
that manages Bayesian inference for models associated with intractable
likelihood functions. Most ABC implementations require the preliminary
selection of a vector of informative statistics summarizing raw data.
Furthermore, in almost all existing implementations, the tolerance level that
separates acceptance from rejection of simulated parameter values needs to be
calibrated. We propose to conduct likelihood-free Bayesian inferences about
parameters with no prior selection of the relevant components of the summary
statistics and bypassing the derivation of the associated tolerance level. The
approach relies on the random forest methodology of Breiman (2001) applied in a
(non parametric) regression setting. We advocate the derivation of a new random
forest for each component of the parameter vector of interest. When compared
with earlier ABC solutions, this method offers significant gains in terms of
robustness to the choice of the summary statistics, does not depend on any type
of tolerance level, and is a good trade-off in term of quality of point
estimator precision and credible interval estimations for a given computing
time. We illustrate the performance of our methodological proposal and compare
it with earlier ABC methods on a Normal toy example and a population genetics
example dealing with human population evolution. All methods designed here have
been incorporated in the R package abcrf (version 1.7) available on CRAN.

complicated by the possibility of so-called band bending and the presence of
surface charges. In this work we study two different interpretations for KPFM
on semiconductors: the contact potential difference (CPD) interpretation, which
interprets the measured potential as the work function difference between the
sample and the probe, and a newer, alternative, interpretation proposed by
Baumgart, Helm and Schmidt (BHS). By performing model calculations we
demonstrate that these models generally lead to very different results. Hence
it is important to decide which one is correct. We demonstrate that BHS
predictions for the Kelvin voltage difference between the $p$ and $n$ parts of
a $pn$-junction are inconsistent with a set of experimental results from the
literature. In addition, the BHS interpretation predicts an independence from
the probe material as well as from surface treatments, which we both find to
disagree with experiment. On the other hand, we present a theoretical argument
for the validity of the CPD interpretation and we show that the CPD
interpretation is able to accommodate all of these experimental results. Thus
we posit that the BHS interpretation is generally not suitable for the analysis
of KPFM on semiconductors and that the CPD interpretation should be used

popular tool for structural determination of biological macromolecular
complexes. High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of
thousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental
micrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in
cryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle
picking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,
making it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop
a highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle
images from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based
algorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy
cryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and
verification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a
convolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively
trained to be highly ""knowledgeable"". Our approach exhibits improved
performance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.
Application of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets
demonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and
non-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The
DeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from
raw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated
improved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel
approach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle
verification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.

emission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I

emission at $\gtrsim$500 GHz is from optically thin part of a synchrotron

that at $\sim$500 GHz. By comparing the $\sim$500 GHz and $\sim$700 GHz

the intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* is varying with time. This
paper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed
calibration quasars. The future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization
observations are required for clarifying the time and frequency variation of

mobile sensors versus the perceived risks by users. First, we propose
PINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user
PINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website
controlled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts
listening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any
permission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user's PIN
using an artificial neural network. Based on a test set of fifty 4-digit PINs,
PINlogger.js is able to correctly identify PINs in the first attempt with a
success rate of 74% which increases to 86 and 94% in the second and third
attempts, respectively. The high success rates of stealing user PINs on mobile
devices via JavaScript indicate a serious threat to user security. With the
technical understanding of the information leakage caused by mobile phone
sensors, we then study users' perception of the risks associated with these
sensors. We design user studies to measure the general familiarity with
different sensors and their functionality, and to investigate how concerned
users are about their PIN being discovered by an app that has access to all
these sensors. Our studies show that there is significant disparity between the
actual and perceived levels of threat with regard to the compromise of the user
PIN. We confirm our results by interviewing our participants using two
different approaches, within-subject and between-subject, and compare the
results. We discuss how this observation, along with other factors, renders
many academic and industry solutions ineffective in preventing such side
channel attacks.

the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculated excitation energies and
the $\alpha$ decay widths of the linear-chain states were compared with the
observed data reported by the recent experiments. The properties of the
positive-parity linear-chain states reasonably agree with the observation, that
convinces us of the linear-chain formation in the positive-parity states. On
the other hand, in the negative-parity states, it is found that the
linear-chain configuration is fragmented into many states and do not form a
single rotational band. As a further evidence of the linear-chain formation, we
focus on the $\alpha$ decay pattern. It is shown that the linear-chain states
decay to the excited states of daughter nucleus $^{10}{\rm Be}$ as well as to
the ground state, while other cluster states dominantly decay into the ground
state. Hence, we regard that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong
signature of the linear-chain formation.

scenarios. The framework is based on joint beamforming and cell association
optimization, with the objective of maximizing the long-term throughput of the

points: (1) spectrum sharing with light on-demand intra- and inter-operator
coordination is feasible, especially at higher mmWave frequencies (for example,
73 GHz), (2) directional communications at the user equipment substantially
alleviate the potential disadvantages of spectrum sharing (such as higher
multiuser interference), (3) large numbers of antenna elements can reduce the
need for coordination and simplify the implementation of spectrum sharing, (4)
while inter-operator coordination can be neglected in the large-antenna regime,
intra-operator coordination can still bring gains by balancing the network
load, and (5) critical control signals among base stations, operators, and user
equipment should be protected from the adverse effects of spectrum sharing, for
example by means of exclusive resource allocation. The results of this paper,

arrangement of cell types. In many cases, gradients of secreted signaling
molecules - morphogens - guide this process. The continuous positional
information provided by the gradient is converted into discrete cell types by
the downstream transcriptional network that responds to the morphogen. A
mechanism commonly used to implement a sharp transition between two adjacent
cell fates is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing
transcriptional determinants. Previous analyses emphasize the steady state
output of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch
and use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the Chemical
Langevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for
studying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary
position. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression
trajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell
states. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final
boundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to
changes in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic
system. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning
time along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating
away from the morphogen source. The velocity of this wave is influenced by
noise; the wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady
state in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally
observed dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the
importance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven
transcriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can
qualitatively alter developmental patterning.

hard, hence only approximate solutions can be hoped for. Although its
applications are mainly in massive data analysis, most of the past research on
diversity maximization focused on the sequential setting. In this work we
present space and pass/round-efficient diversity maximization algorithms for
the Streaming and MapReduce models and analyze their approximation guarantees
for the relevant class of metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension. Like
other approaches in the literature, our algorithms rely on the determination of
high-quality core-sets, i.e., (much) smaller subsets of the input which contain
good approximations to the optimal solution for the whole input. For a variety
of diversity objective functions, our algorithms attain an
$(\alpha+\epsilon)$-approximation ratio, for any constant $\epsilon>0$, where
$\alpha$ is the best approximation ratio achieved by a polynomial-time,
linear-space sequential algorithm for the same diversity objective. This
improves substantially over the approximation ratios attainable in Streaming

distribution (ALD) mainly because of its satisfactory empirical and theoretical
performances. However, the ALD displays medium tails and it is not suitable for
data characterized by strong deviations from the Gaussian hypothesis. In this
paper, we propose an extension of the ALD Bayesian quantile regression
framework to account for fat-tails using the Skew Exponential Power (SEP)
distribution. Beside having the $\tau$-level quantile as parameter, the SEP
distribution has an additional key parameter governing the decay of the tails,
making it attractive for robust modeling of conditional quantiles at different
confidence levels. Linear and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with penalized
spline are considered to show the flexibility of the SEP in the Bayesian
quantile regression context. Lasso priors are considered in both cases to
account for shrinking parameters problem when the parameters space becomes
wide. To implement the Bayesian inference we propose a new adaptive

within Gibbs one in the GAM framework. Empirical evidence of the statistical
properties of the proposed SEP Bayesian quantile regression method is provided

are important tools to study how the metal content in galaxies evolves as a
function of time. In this work, we present new analytical solutions for the
evolution of the gas mass, total mass and metallicity of a galactic system,
when a decaying exponential infall rate of gas and galactic winds are assumed.
We apply our model to characterize a sample of local star-forming and passive
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, with the aim of reproducing
their observed mass-metallicity relation; in this way, we can derive how the
two populations of star-forming and passive galaxies differ in their particular
distribution of ages, formation time scales, infall masses and mass loading
factors. We find that the local passive galaxies are on average older and
assembled on shorter typical time-scales than the local star-forming ones; on
the other hand, the larger mass star-forming galaxies show generally older ages
and longer typical formation time-scales compared with the smaller mass
star-forming galaxies. Finally, we conclude that the local star-forming
galaxies experience stronger galactic winds than the passive galaxy population.
We explore the effect of assuming different initial mass functions in our
model, showing that to reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation
stronger winds are requested if the initial mass function is top-heavy.
Finally, our analytical models predict the assumed sample of local galaxies to
lie on a tight surface in the 3D space defined by stellar metallicity, star
formation rate and stellar mass, thus mimicking the well-known ""fundamental
relation"".

campaign of the quasar PG1211+143. We constructed broad-band, optical/UV/X-ray
spectral energy distributions over three X-ray flux intervals. We fitted them
with a model which accounts for the disc and the X-ray coronal emission and the
warm absorber (well established in this source). The three flux spectra are
well fitted by the model we considered. The disc inner temperature remains
constant at ~2 eV, while X-rays are variable both in spectral slope and
normalization. The absorber covers almost 90% of the central source. It is
outflowing with a velocity less than 2.3*10^4 km/s (3sigma upper limit), and
has a column density of ~10^23.2. Its ionization parameter varies by a factor
of 1.6, and it is in photo-ionizing equilibrium with the ionizing flux. It is
located at a distance of less than 0.35 pc from the central source and its
relative thickness, DR/R is less than 0.1. The absorber' s ionization parameter
variations can explain the larger than average amplitude of the X-ray
variations. The absence of optical/UV variations (consistent with the high
black hole mass estimate) argues against the presence of inward propagating
disc fluctuations and strong X-ray illumination of the disc (in agreement with
the low ratio of X-ray over the bolometric luminosity of ~20-35). We estimate
an upper limit for the mass outflow of ~5 solar masses per year (~2.3 times the
Eddington mass accretion rate). If the outflow rate is indeed that high, then
it must be a short-lived episode in the quasar's life time. Finally, we
estimate an upper limit for the kinetic power of the outflow of ~1.4*10^43
ergs/s. This outflow cannot deploy significant mechanical energy to the
surrounding ISM of the quasar's host galaxy, but is sufficient to heat the ISM
to 10^7 K and to produce a fast decline to the star formation rate of the
galaxy.

fragmentation of protostellar discs. We start with a review of how observations
of prestellar cores can be analysed statistically to yield plausible initial
conditions for simulations of their subsequent collapse. Simulations based on
these initial conditions show that, despite the low levels of turbulence in
prestellar cores, they deliver primary protostars and associated discs which
are routinely subject to stochastic impulsive perturbations; consequently
misalignment of the spins and orbits of protostars are common. Also, the
simulations produce protostars that collectively have a mass function and
binary statistics matching those observed in nearby star formation regions, but
only if a significant fraction of the turbulent energy in the core is
solenoidal, and accretion onto the primary protostar is episodic with a duty
cycle > 3000 yr. Under this circumstance a core typically spawns between 4 and
5 protostars, with high efficiency, and the lower-mass protostars are mainly
formed by disc fragmentation. The requirement that a proto-fragment in a disc
lose thermal energy on a dynamical timescale dictates that {\bf there is a
sweet spot for} disc fragmentation at radii 70 AU < R < 100 AU and temperatures
10 K < T < 20 K, and this might explain the Brown Dwarf Desert.

surrounding devices and to establish a first contact between them. Since the
clocks of the devices are not synchronized and their energy-budgets are
limited, usually duty-cycled, asynchronous discovery protocols are applied.
Only if two devices are awake at the same point in time, they can rendezvous.
Currently, time-slotted protocols, which subdivide time into multiple intervals
with equal lengths (slots), are considered to be the most efficient discovery
schemes. In this paper, we break away from the assumption of slotted time. We
propose a novel, continuous-time discovery protocol, which temporally decouples
beaconing and listening. Each device periodically sends packets with a certain
interval, and periodically listens for a given duration with a different
interval. By optimizing these interval lengths, we show that this scheme can,
to the best of our knowledge, outperform all known protocols such as DISCO,
U-Connect or Searchlight significantly. For example, Searchlight takes up to
740 % longer than our proposed technique to discover a device with the same
duty-cycle. Further, our proposed technique can also be applied in widely-used
asymmetric purely interval-based protocols such as ANT or Bluetooth Low Energy.

eventually fully uncorrelated on the attracting set. This process of
decorrelation may split into an initial exponential decrease, characterized by
the maximal Lyapunov exponent, and a subsequent diffusive process on the
chaotic attractor causing the final loss of predictability. The time scales of
both processes can be either of the same or of very different orders of
magnitude. In the latter case the two trajectories linger within a finite but
small distance (with respect to the overall extent of the attractor) for
exceedingly long times and therefore remain partially predictable.
  Tests for distinguishing chaos from laminar flow widely use the time
evolution of inter-orbital correlations as an indicator. Standard tests however
yield mostly ambiguous results when it comes to distinguish partially
predictable chaos and laminar flow, which are characterized respectively by
attractors of fractally broadened braids and limit cycles. For a resolution we
introduce a novel 0-1 indicator for chaos based on the cross-distance scaling
of pairs of initially close trajectories, showing that this test robustly
discriminates chaos, including partially predictable chaos, from laminar flow.
One can use furthermore the finite time cross-correlation of pairs of initially
close trajectories to distinguish, for a complete classification, also between
strong and partially predictable chaos. We are thus able to identify laminar
flow as well as strong and partially predictable chaos in a 0-1 manner solely
from the properties of pairs of trajectories.

accommodated by the simplest extensions of General Relativity, such as f(R)

we present the outcomes of a suite of large N-body simulations carried out in
the context of a cosmological model featuring a non-vanishing scattering cross
section between the dark matter and the dark energy fields, for two different

that these Dark Scattering models have very mild effects on many observables
related to large-scale structures formation and evolution, while providing a
significant suppression of the amplitude of linear density perturbations and
the abundance of massive clusters. Our simulations therefore confirm that these

in Intelligent Embedded Systems), a new approach to novelty detection in
technical systems. We assume that in a technical system several processes
interact. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model the
observations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, the
components of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to the
processes in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge in
the technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As a
consequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation of
the model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used for
classification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of the
models' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-density
regions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-density
regions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focus
on the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requires
different detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique to
detect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast online
goodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine this
approach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented in
preliminary work. The properties of CANDIES are evaluated using artificial data
and benchmark data from the field of intrusion detection in computer networks,

of the amount collected. We fit the reallocation rate parameter required for
the model to reproduce observed wealth inequality in the United States from
1917 to 2012. We find that this rate was positive until the 1980s, after which
it became negative and of increasing magnitude. With negative reallocation, the
system cannot equilibrate. Even with the positive reallocation rates observed,
equilibration is too slow to be practically relevant. Therefore, studies which

additional {\it finite} quantum correction $\Delta U(\phi,\sigma)$, beyond the
Coleman Weinberg term. $\Delta U$ contains new, non-polynomial effective
operators like $\phi^6/\sigma^2$ whose quantum origin is explained. A flat
direction is maintained at the quantum level, the model has vanishing vacuum

confirmed by numerical simulations. Quantitatively, achievable rate gains up to

converging flows. The condensations must be sufficiently massive, dense and
cool to be gravitationally unstable, so that they start to contract; {\it and}
they must then radiate away thermal energy fast enough for self-gravity to
remain dominant, so that they continue to contract. For the metallicities and
temperatures in local star forming clouds, this second requirement is only met
robustly when the gas couples thermally to the dust, because this delivers the
capacity to radiate across the full bandwidth of the continuum, rather than
just in a few discrete spectral lines. This translates into a threshold for
vigorous star formation, which can be written as a minimum ram-pressure Pcrit ~
4 10^-11 dyne. Pcrit is independent of temperature, and corresponds to flows
with molecular hydrogen number-density nH2 and velocity v satisfying nH2 v^2 >
800 cm^-3 (km/s)^2. This in turn corresponds to a minimum molecular hydrogen
column-density for vigorous star formation, NH2crit ~ 4 10^21 cm^-2 (SIGMAcrit
~ 100 MSun pc^-2), and a minimum visual extinction AVcrit ~ 9. The
characteristic diameter and line-density for a star-forming filament when this
threshold is just exceeded -- a sweet spot for local star formation regions --
are 2Rfil ~ 0.1 pc and mufil ~ 13 MSun pc^-2. The characteristic diameter and
mass for a prestellar core condensing out of such a filament are 2Rcore ~ 0.1
pc, and Mcore ~ MSun. We also show that fragmentation of a shock-compressed
layer is likely to commence while the convergent flows creating the layer are
still ongoing, and we stress that, under this circumstance, the phenomenology
and characteristic scales for fragmentation of the layer are fundamentally
different from those derived traditionally for pre-existing layers.

modulating the discrete nonlinear spectrum of an $N$-solitary waveform. To
generate an $N$-solitary waveform from desired discrete spectrum (eigenvalue
and discrete spectral amplitudes), we use the Darboux Transform. We explain how
to the norming factors must be set in order to have the desired discrete
spectrum. To derive these norming factors, we study the evolution of nonlinear
spectrum by adding a new eigenvalue and its spectral amplitude. We further
simplify the Darboux transform algorithm.
  We propose a novel algorithm (to the best of our knowledge) to numerically
compute the nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) of a given pulse. The NFT
algorithm, called forward-backward method, is based on splitting the signal
into two parts and computing the nonlinear spectrum of each part from boundary
($\pm\infty$) inward. The nonlinear spectrum (discrete and continuous) derived
from efficiently combining both parts has a promising numerical precision. This
method can use any of one-step discretization NFT methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson,
as an NFT kernel for the forward or backward part. Using trapezoid rule of
integral, we use an NFT kernel (we called here Trapezoid discretization NFT) in
forward-backward method which results discrete spectral amplitudes with a very
good numerical precision.
  These algorithms, forward-backward method and Darboux transform, are used in

recently, in [3] for design and detection of more complex pulses with 7
eigenvalues and modulation of spectral phase. For those soliton pulses, the

on initial conditions (resp., $\mathscr{F}$-sensitive, multi-sensitive) if and
only if its $g$-fuzzification is sensitively dependent on initial conditions
(resp., $\mathscr{F}$-sensitive, multi-sensitive), where $\mathscr{F}$ is a
Furstenberg family. As an application, it is shown that there exists a
sensitive dynamical system whose $g$-fuzzification does not have such sensitive
dependence for any $g$ in a certain domain. Moreover, a sufficient condition
ensuring that the $g$-fuzzification of every nontrivial dynamical system is not
transitive is obtained. These give an answer to a question posed in \cite[J.

the Ehrenfest theorem and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, lack in their standard
form important information: there are cases where non-Hermitian boundary
contributions emerge. These contributions actually appear naturally, in order
for the above theorems to be valid and applicable (i.e. in multiply-connected
spaces), and this occurs for physical quantities that are not represented by
well-defined self-adjoint operators (such as the position operator in a
periodic potential, or in general Aharonov-Bohm configurations, either in real
or in an arbitrary parameter-space, in the sense of Berry's adiabatic and
cyclic procedures). In this short note, we report modifications of these two
theorems when such non-Hermiticities appear, and we demonstrate how they
resolve certain Quantum Mechanical paradoxes (most of them having been noticed
in the past as violations of the so-called Hypervirial theorem in Quantum
Chemistry). This resolution of paradoxes (essentially the re-establishment of
applicability of the Ehrenfest theorem even in multiply-connected spaces)
always proceeds through the appearance of certain generalized currents, in a
theoretical picture with interesting structure (where a generalized continuity
equation with a sink term shows up naturally).

theory, whereas the present work reveals that it actually plays a central role
in clarifying various controversies of quantum theory. The basic idea is
contained in a hypothesis on negative energy, and it is shown that the idea:
(1)is compatible with both relativistic quantum mechanics and known
experimental results; (2)helps to clarify the essence of matter waves, and
therefore better understand the reality of the wave function, the so-called
'wave-packet reduction' occurring in quantum measurement, and the ghost like
correlations between entangled systems; (3)is helpful for distinguishing the
vacuum from the ground state of the quantized field, and may supply a possible
way for removing the deep-rooted infinities in quantum field theory. The vacuum
energy density of the electromagnetic field is calculated here as an example.
By employing the same idea, the Lamb-Shift is recalculated in a different way
from conventional renormalization method, yet the same result as Bethe's can be
definitely obtained.

object, whose continuum approximation is called the space 3-brane. The world
volume ${\cal WV}_{\rm sq}$ of this space 3-brane is described by an embedding
$f^A(x^\mu) \in {\cal S}^{D_{\rm amb}}$, which produces the induced metric
$\gamma_{\mu \nu}$ on the world volume ${\cal WV}_{\rm sq}$. This emergent
spacetime (${\cal WV}_{\rm sq}, \gamma_{\mu \nu}$) from the many space quanta
is proposed as the particle model of our spacetime. To study our spacetime
(${\cal WV}_{\rm sq}, \gamma_{\mu \nu}$), we construct what we call the
Aim-At-Target (AAT) method, which introduces an action for a 4D metric $g_{\mu
\nu}$. This metric action from the AAT method can lead to General Relativity at
low enough energies. The spacetime (${\cal S}_{\rm GR}, {\bf g}_{\mu \nu}$) of
General Relativity is, at least, a good approximation to the exact or true
spacetime (${\cal WV}_{\rm sq}, \gamma_{\mu \nu}$) of our universe.
