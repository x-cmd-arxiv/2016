nonlinear systems over uncertain communication channels. We show the ability to
stabilize a system over such channels is fundamentally limited and the channel
uncertainty must provide a minimal Quality of Service (QoS) to support
stabilization. The smallest QoS necessary for stabilization is shown as a
function of the positive Lyapunov exponents of uncontrolled nonlinear systems.
The positive Lyapunov exponent is a measure of dynamical complexity and
captures the rate of exponential divergence of nearby system trajectories. One
of the main highlights of our results is the role played by nonequilibrium
dynamics to determine the limitation for incremental stabilization over
networks with uncertainty.

each connection is allocated with a working (primary) path and a protection

establishment of a single connection, only heuristics have been proposed for
the multi-connection case. We investigate the algorithmic tractability of
multi-connection establishment problems, both in online and offline frameworks.
First, we focus on the special case of two connections, and study the
tractability of three variants of the problem. We show that only one variant is
tractable, for which we establish an optimal solution of polynomial complexity.
For the other variants, which are shown to be NP-hard, heuristic schemes are
proposed. These heuristics are designed based on the insight gained from our
study. Through simulations, we indicate the advantages of these heuristics over
more straightforward alternatives. We extend our study to K connections, for a
fixed K that is larger than 2. We prove the tractability of online and offline
variants of the problem, in which sharing links along backup paths is allowed,
and we establish corresponding optimal solutions. On the other hand, we show
that, if the number of connections is not fixed (i.e., K is not O(1)), then the
problem is, in general, NP-hard.

Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural Information
Processing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statistical
methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being
increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state
detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis
methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional
signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category
of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental
disorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate
approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual
imaging measurement in isolation.
  We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how
questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is
now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally
important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly
evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there
is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of
rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific
paradigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the
interaction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the
workshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across
the neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to
sketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology.

The determination of meteoroid mass indices is central to flux
measurements and evolutionary studies of meteoroid populations. However,
different authors use different approaches to fit observed data, making results
difficult to reproduce and the resulting uncertainties difficult to justify.
The real, physical, uncertainties are usually an order of magnitude higher than
the reported values.
  Aims. We aim to develop a fully automated method that will measure meteoroid
mass indices and associated uncertainty. We validate our method on large radar
and optical datasets and compare results to obtain a best estimate of the true
meteoroid mass index.
  Methods. Using MultiNest, a Bayesian inference tool that calculates the
evidence and explores the parameter space, we search for the best fit of
cumulative number vs. mass distributions in a four-dimensional space of
variables ($a,b,X_1,X_2$). We explore biases in meteor echo distributions using
optical meteor data as a calibration dataset to establish the systematic offset
in measured mass index values.
  Results. Our best estimate for the average de-biased mass index for the
sporadic meteoroid complex, as measured by radar appropriate to the mass range
$10^{-3} > \mathrm{m} > 10^{-5}$ g, was $s=-2.10 \pm 0.08$. Optical data in the
$10^{-1} > \mathrm{m} > 10^{-3}$ g range, with the shower meteors removed,
produced $s=-2.08 \pm 0.08$. We find the mass index used by Grun et al. 1985 is
substantially larger than we measure in the $10^{-4} < m < 10^{-1}$ g range.

opacities (OPLIB data using the ATOMIC code) for elements with atomic number
Z=1-30 with improved physics input, updated atomic data, and finer temperature
grid to replace the Los Alamos LEDCOP opacities released in the year 2000. We
calculate the evolution of standard solar models including these new opacities,
and compare with models evolved using the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory OPAL (Iglesias and Rogers 1996) opacities. We use the solar
abundance mixture of Asplund et al. (2009). The new Los Alamos ATOMIC opacities
have steeper opacity derivatives than those of OPAL for temperatures and
densities of the solar interior radiative zone. We compare the calculated
nonadiabatic solar oscillation frequencies and solar interior sound speed to
observed frequencies and helioseismic inferences. The calculated sound-speed
profiles are similar for models evolved using either the updated Iben evolution
code (see \cite{Guzik2010}), or the MESA evolution code (Paxton et al., 2015).
The LANL ATOMIC opacities partially mitigate the ""solar abundance problem"".

linear identification of the Koopman operator. In the second step, the obtained
Koopman operator is ""projected back"" to the finite-dimensional state space, and
identified to the nonlinear vector field through a linear least squares
problem. The proposed technique is efficient to recover (polynomial) vector
fields of different classes of systems, including unstable, chaotic, and open

diffusion equation with radio galaxies as sources of electrons, and SFGs as

scattering of electrons from radio galaxies off the CMB, whereas $\gamma$-ray

into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions
that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded

competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph.
By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are
capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics,
including limit cycles, quasiperiodic attractors, and chaos. In particular,
several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our
mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic

that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the

obtain an aggregated rank ordering that is more accurate and robust, and also
helps weed out rank lists of dubious validity. We validate our techniques on
synthetic datasets where our algorithm is able to estimate the true rank
ordering even when the rank lists are corrupted. Experiments on three real

alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting. Our
results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in the
original data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of the
linear relationship. The framework is extended to general histogram data with
larger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Our
experimental results on simulated data and aggregated healthcare data suggest a

Benchmarking tests of RNAiFold2T against existent programs (adaptive walk and
genetic algorithm) inverse folding show that our software generates two orders
of magnitude more solutions, thus allow- ing ample exploration of the space of
solutions. Subsequently, solutions can be prioritized by computing various
measures, including probability of target structure in the ensemble, melting
temperature, etc. Using this strategy, we rationally designed two thermosensor
internal ribosome entry site (thermo-IRES) elements, whose normalized
cap-independent transla- tion efficiency is approximately 50% greater at 42?C
than 30?C, when tested in reticulocyte lysates. Translation efficiency is lower

complementarities. People with more friends experience greater interactive
effects and hence engage more in socially influenced activities. Given the
friendship paradox, people then perceive more engagement when sampling their
friends than exists in the overall population. Given the complementarities,
this feeds back to amplify average engagement. In addition, people with the
greatest innate benefits from a behavior also tend to be the ones who choose to
interact the most, leading to further feedback and amplification. These results
are consistent with studies finding that people consistently overestimate peer
consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs; and, can help explain problems
with adolescent abuse of drugs and binge-drinking, as well as other behaviors.

basis computation. Given a polynomial system, both models allow an algorithm to
selectively ignore some of the polynomials: the algorithm is only responsible
for returning a Gr\""obner basis for the ideal generated by the remaining
polynomials. For the $q$-Fractional Gr\""obner Basis Problem the algorithm is
allowed to ignore a constant $(1-q)$-fraction of the polynomials (subject to
one natural structural constraint). Here we prove a new strongest-parameter
result: even if the algorithm is allowed to choose a $(3/10-\epsilon)$-fraction
of the polynomials to ignore, and need only compute a Gr\""obner basis with
respect to some lexicographic order for the remaining polynomials, this cannot
be accomplished in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$). This statement holds even
if every polynomial has maximum degree 3. Next, we prove the first robust
hardness result for polynomial systems of maximum degree 2: for the
$q$-Fractional model a $(1/5-\epsilon)$ fraction of the polynomials may be
ignored without losing provable NP-Hardness. Both theorems hold even if every
polynomial contains at most three distinct variables. Finally, for the Strong

However,
most of the world's languages do not have large amounts of syntactically
annotated corpora available for building parsers. Syntactic projection
techniques attempt to address this issue by using parallel corpora consisting
of resource-poor and resource-rich language pairs, taking advantage of a parser
for the resource-rich language and word alignment between the languages to
project the parses onto the data for the resource-poor language. These
projection methods can suffer, however, when the two languages are divergent.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using small, parallel,
annotated corpora to automatically detect divergent structural patterns between
two languages. These patterns can then be used to improve structural projection
algorithms, allowing for better performing NLP tools for resource-poor
languages, in particular those that may not have large amounts of annotated
data necessary for traditional, fully-supervised methods. While this detection
process is not exhaustive, we demonstrate that common patterns of divergence
can be identified automatically without prior knowledge of a given language
pair, and the patterns can be used to improve performance of projection
algorithms.

different sets of scales and orientations, are investigated, resulting in
different barcode lengths and retrieval performances. The proposed method has

exceeding observational upper limits. That is, primordial tensor perturbations
on superhorizon scales can be constrained from the absence of PBHs. In our

and hence in this paper, we present detailed derivations, solving the Einstein
equations for scalar perturbations induced at second order in tensor
perturbations. We also derive an approximate formula for the probability
density function of induced density perturbations, necessary to relate the

ejection. In this article, we consider the serendipitous interferometric
monitoring of a modest version of a discrete ejection described in Reid et al.
(2014) that would have otherwise escaped detection in daily radio light curves.
The observation begins $\sim 1$ hour after the onset of the ejection, providing
unprecedented accuracy on the estimate of the ejection time. The astrometric
measurements allow us to determine the time of ejection as $\rm{MJD}\,
56436.274^{+0.016}_{-0.013}$, i.e., within a precision of 41 minutes (95\%
confidence). Just like larger flares, we find that the X-ray luminosity
increases in last 2 - 4 hours preceding ejection. Our finite temporal
resolution indicates that this elevated X-ray flux persists within
$21.8^{+22.6}_{-19.1}$ minutes of the ejection with 95\% confidence, the
highest temporal precision of the X-ray - superluminal ejection connection to
date. This observation provides direct evidence that the physics that launches
major flares occurs on smaller scales as well (lower radio flux and shorter
ejection episodes). The observation of a X-ray spike prior to a discrete
ejection, although of very modest amplitude suggests that the process linking

three spacetime dimensions admits a new family of boundary conditions being
labeled by a nonnegative integer $k$. Gravitational excitations are then
described by ""boundary gravitons"" that fulfill the equations of the $k$-th
element of the KdV hierarchy. In particular, $k=0$ corresponds to the
Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions so that excitations are described by chiral
movers. In the case of $k=1$, the boundary gravitons fulfill the KdV equation
and the asymptotic symmetry algebra turns out to be infinite-dimensional,
abelian and devoid of central extensions. The latter feature also holds for the
remaining cases that describe the hierarchy ($k>1$). Our boundary conditions
then provide a gravitational dual of two noninteracting left and right KdV
movers, and hence, boundary gravitons possess anisotropic Lifshitz scaling with
dynamical exponent $z=2k+1$. Remarkably, despite spacetimes solving the field
equations are locally AdS, they possess anisotropic scaling being induced by
the choice of boundary conditions. As an application, the entropy of a rotating
BTZ black hole is precisely recovered from a suitable generalization of the
Cardy formula that is compatible with the anisotropic scaling of the chiral KdV
movers at the boundary, in which the energy of AdS spacetime with our boundary
conditions depends on $z$ and plays the role of the central charge. The
extension of our boundary conditions to the case of higher spin gravity and its
link with different classes of integrable systems is also briefly addressed.

source of this bias is the cell cycle, which introduces large within-cell-type
heterogeneity that can obscure the differences in expression between cell
types. The current method for removing the cell-cycle effect is unable to
effectively identify this effect and has a high risk of removing other
biological components of interest, compromising downstream analysis. We present
ccRemover, a new method that reliably identifies the cell-cycle effect and
removes it. ccRemover preserves other biological signals of interest in the
data and thus can serve as an important pre-processing step for many scRNA-Seq
data analyses. The effectiveness of ccRemover is demonstrated using simulation
data and three real scRNA-Seq datasets, where it boosts the performance of
existing clustering algorithms in distinguishing between cell types.

not only works very well in reproducing the phase transitions and critical

a $B$-field because it has a magnetic dipole moment proportional to $m$.
Moreover, it was recently shown that a polarized or anisotropic medium
engenders the same effect for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos. Because a
$B$-field polarizes a background medium, it instigates helicity oscillations
even for Majorana neutrinos unless the medium is symmetric between matter and
antimatter. Motivated by these observations, we review the impact of a
$B$-field and of an anisotropic or polarized medium on helicity oscillations
for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos from the common perspective of in-medium

state of dx2-y2-wave superconducting (d-SC) and antiferromagnetic (AF) orders,
in addition to simple d-SC, AF, and normal (paramagnetic) states, by applying a
variational Monte Carlo method to a two-dimensional Hubbard (t-t'-U) model. In
a weakly correlated regime (U=t<~6), BRE are negligible on all the states
studied. As previously shown, the effective band of d-SC is greatly
renormalized but the modifications of physical quantities, including energy
improvement, are negligible. In contrast, BRE on the AF state considerably
affects various features of the system. Because the energy is markedly improved
for t'/t<0, the AF state occupies almost the whole underdoped regime in phase
diagrams. A doped metallic AF state undergoes a kind of Lifshitz transition at
t'= t'L~-0.05t as t'/t varies, irrespective of the values of U/t and delta
(doping rate). Pocket Fermi surfaces arise around (pi,0)[(pi/2,pi/2)] for
t'>t'L [t'<t'L], which corresponds to the electron-hole asymmetry observed in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra. The coexistent state
of the two orders is possible basically for t'>t'L, because the existence of
Fermi surfaces near (pi,0) is a requisite for the electron scattering of
q=(pi,pi). Actually, the coexistent state appears mainly for t'L/t<t'/t<~0.2 in
the mixed state. Nevertheless, the AF and coexisting states become unstable
toward phase separation for -0.05<~t'/t<~0.2 but become stable at other values
of t'/t owing to the energy reduction by the diagonal hopping of doped holes.
We show that this instability does not directly correlate with the strength of
d-SC.

recent findings appear to support their role in cancer prevention and

Furthermore, they may modulate the host immune response to cancer, reducing
inflammatory microenvironment and enhancing lymphocyte onco-surveillance. Since
carcinogenesis is multi-factorial and involves several signaling pathways,
multi-targeted agents as phytochemicals may represent promising anticancer
compounds. This narrative review aims to analyze the current literature on
phytochemicals highlighting their specific targets on carcinogenic molecular
pathways and their chemopreventive role. A full comprehension of their activity

The existence of such a pair entails that the mean payoff per time unit is

stationary strategies. By exploiting two fundamental properties of Shapley
operators, monotonicity and additive homogeneity, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the solvability of the ergodic equation for all the
Shapley operators obtained by perturbation of the transition payments of a
given stochastic game with finite state space. If the latter condition is

statistical models which rely on inputs of phenomenological level densities and
potential barriers. Therefore the microscopic descriptions of spontaneous
fission and induced fission are very desirable for a unified understanding of
various fission processes.
  We propose to study the fission rates, at both low and high temperatures,
with microscopically calculated temperature-dependent fission barriers and
collective mass parameters.
  The fission barriers are calculated by the finite-temperature
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method. The mass parameters are calculated by the
temperature-dependent cranking approximation. The thermal fission rates can be
obtained by the imaginary free energy approach at all temperatures, in which
fission barriers are naturally temperature dependent. The fission at low
temperatures can be described mainly as a barrier-tunneling process. While the
fission at high temperatures has to incorporate the reflection above barriers.
Our results of spontaneous fission rates reasonably agree with other studies
and experiments. The temperature dependencies of fission barrier heights and
curvatures have been discussed. The temperature dependent behaviors of mass
parameters have also been discussed. The thermal fission rates from low to high
temperatures with a smooth connection have been given by different approaches.
\item[Conclusions] Since the temperature dependencies of fission barrier
heights and curvatures, and the mass parameters can vary rapidly for different
nuclei, the microscopic descriptions of thermal fission rates are very
valuable. Our studies without free parameters provide a consistent picture to
study various fissions such as that in fast-neutron reactors, astrophysical
environments and fusion reactions for superheavy nuclei.

signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait
intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under
three conditions: session specific calibration, intersession transfer, and
intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most
accurate for session specific calibration (movement intention was correctly
detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke
patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector
that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the
only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke
patients) w.r.t. session specific calibration. Thus, MRCP phase features
improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove
time-consuming BCI recalibration.

(SNR) at the output of the Capon's minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamformers when operating over impulsive noises. Particularly, we
consider the supervised case in which the receiver employs the regularized
Tyler estimator in order to estimate the covariance matrix of the
interference-plus-noise process using $n$ observations of size $N\times 1$. The
choice for the regularized Tylor estimator (RTE) is motivated by its resilience
to the presence of outliers and its regularization parameter that guarantees a
good conditioning of the covariance estimate. Of particular interest in this
paper is the derivation of the second order statistics of the SINR. To achieve
this goal, we consider two different approaches. The first one is based on
considering the classical regime, referred to as the $n$-large regime, in which
$N$ is assumed to be fixed while $n$ grows to infinity. The second approach is
built upon recent results developed within the framework of random matrix
theory and assumes that $N$ and $n$ grow large together. Numerical results are
provided in order to compare between the accuracies of each regime under
different settings.

$G=(V,E)$ is a set of edges, whose addition to the graph guarantees that every

Cohen \cite[JACM 2000]{C00} introduced the notion of hopsets in the context of
parallel computation of approximate shortest paths, and since then it has found
numerous applications in various other settings, such as dynamic graph
algorithms, distributed computing, and the streaming model.
  Cohen \cite{C00} devised efficient algorithms for constructing hopsets with
{\em polylogarithmic} in $n$ number of hops. Her constructions remain the
state-of-the--art since the publication of her paper in STOC'94, i.e., for more

  In this paper we exhibit the first construction of sparse hopsets with a {\em

various computational settings, improving the best known constructions.
Generally, our hopsets strictly outperform the hopsets of \cite{C00}, both in

slow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated objects. This model is
sufficiently simple and concise to enable designing a closed-loop controller,
capable of accurate vertical positioning of a carried object. The near-field
acoustic levitation phenomenon exploits the compressibility, the nonlinearity
and the viscosity of the gas trapped between a rapidly oscillating surface and
a freely suspended planar object, to elevate its time averaged pressure above
the ambient pressure. By these means, the vertical position of loads weighing
up to several kilograms can be varied between dozens and hundreds of
micrometers. The simplified model developed in this paper is a second order
ordinary differential equation where the height-dependent stiffness and damping
terms of the gas layer are derived explicitly. This simplified model replaces a
traditional model consisting of the equation of motion of the levitated object,
coupled to a nonlinear partial differential equation, accounting for the
behavior of the entrapped gas. Due to the relatively simple form of the model
developed here, it constitutes a convenient foundation for model based control
algorithms, governing the slow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated
objects. Indeed, based on the former, a height dependent, gain scheduled PID
controller is developed and verified numerically and experimentally, both
providing satisfying results.

networks. However, the spreading dynamics on this kind of network has not been
fully studied. To this end, we systematically study the effects of time-varying
community structures on social contagions. We first propose a non-Markovian
social contagion model on time-varying community networks based on the activity
driven network model, in which an individual adopts a behavior if and only if
the accumulated behavioral information it has ever received reaches a
threshold. Then, we develop a mean-field theory to describe the proposed model.
From theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we find that behavior
adoption in the social contagions exhibits a hierarchical feature, i.e., the
behavior first quickly spreads in one of the communities, and then outbreaks in
the other. Moreover, under different behavioral information transmission rates,
the final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus the
community strength shows one of the patterns, which are a monotone increasing
pattern, a non-monotonic changing pattern, and a monotone decreasing pattern.
An optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption can be
found in a suitable range of behavioral information transmission rate. Finally,
for a given average degree, increasing the number of edges generated by active
nodes is more beneficial to the social contagions than increasing the average
activity potential.

the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However,
computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for
classical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum
simulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes
for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the
difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws
(Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental
demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by
realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a
few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time
evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare
vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous
creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum
resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge
fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and
efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger
mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production
and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time
evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle
creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents
a first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic
physics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time
quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.
