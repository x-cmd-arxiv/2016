disordered proteins (IDPs) is critical in the biological function of

to be elucidated. Here we present a theory in the random phase approximation to
account for electrostatic effects in polyampholyte phase separations, yielding
predictions consistent with recent experiments on the IDP Ddx4. The theory is
applicable to any charge pattern and thus provides a general analytical

models that describe the dynamics of subnetworks. It has previously been
established using projection methods that such subnetwork dynamics generically
involves memory of the past, and that the memory functions can be calculated
explicitly for biochemical reaction networks made up of unary and binary
reactions. However, many established network models involve also
Michaelis-Menten kinetics, to describe e.g. enzymatic reactions. We show that
the projection approach to subnetwork dynamics can be extended to such
networks, thus significantly broadening its range of applicability. To derive
the extension we construct a larger network that represents enzymes and enzyme
complexes explicitly, obtain the projected equations, and finally take the
limit of fast enzyme reactions that gives back Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The
crucial point is that this limit can be taken in closed form. The outcome is a
simple procedure that allows one to obtain a description of subnetwork
dynamics, including memory functions, starting directly from any given network
of unary, binary and Michaelis-Menten reactions. Numerical tests show that this
closed form enzyme elimination gives a much more accurate description of the
subnetwork dynamics than the simpler method that represents enzymes explicitly,
and is also more efficient computationally.

action potentials (""spikes"") encode information about sensory signals and motor
outputs. Although traditional theories of neural coding assume that information
is conveyed by the total number of spikes fired (spike rate), recent studies of
sensory and motor activity have shown that far more information is carried by
the millisecond-scale timing patterns of action potentials (spike timing).
However, it is unknown whether or how subtle differences in spike timing drive
differences in perception or behavior, leaving it unclear whether the
information carried by spike timing actually plays a causal role in brain
function. Here we demonstrate how a precise spike timing code is read out
downstream by the muscles to control behavior. We provide both correlative and
causal evidence to show that the nervous system uses millisecond-scale
variations in the timing of spikes within multi-spike patterns to regulate a
relatively simple behavior - respiration in the Bengalese finch, a songbird.
These findings suggest that a fundamental assumption of current theories of
motor coding requires revision, and that significant improvements in
applications, such as neural prosthetic devices, can be achieved by using
precise spike timing information.

recently motivated the computer security researchers' in academia and industry
to design and develop graphical user identification systems (GUISs).
Cognometric GUISs are more memorable than drawmetric GUISs, but takes more time
to authenticate. None of the previously proposed GUISs combines the advantages
of both cognometric and drawmetric systems. A signature personify a person and
a graphical signature is easier to recall than other drawings. This paper
proposes a new graphical Signature-based User Identification System named SUIS.
It is based on a 2D grid technology, that is used to draw, digitize and store
the signature for user identification. SUIS is categorized as both a
cognometric and drawmetric system. Unlike other systems that use 2D grid: We
take one cell in a grid as one pixel in the drawing; for signature matching,
the signature drawn has to follow the same grid cells as the signature stored,
independent of the sequence; and that the system is not based on any machine
learning model. Increasing the number of grid cells increases the password
space, and decreasing the size of the grid cell increases the precision of the
signature. These characteristics makes SUIS: (1) Rigorous enough to be a
password system, but easy enough to be usable. (2) Independent of the language
and device used to draw the signature. (3) Efficient and practical to be used
for online authentication systems.

our technique is that it neither applies complex transformations to the

requires solving only linear algebraic systems with a constant nonsingular

general algorithm that can be programmed in Maple or Mathematica to simulate

popular algorithms for computational inference in Graphical Models (GM). In
principle, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which, however, often suffers
from exponentially slow mixing. In contrast, BP is a deterministic method,
which is typically fast, empirically very successful, however in general
lacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs. In this paper, we introduce MCMC
algorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to
compensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is
based on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows expressing the BP error
as a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is
computationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up
all 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise
binary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.
Motivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme
for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our
main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in
other (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to
sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-free
MCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying our
design is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficient
decomposition of the generalized loops. In essence, the proposed MCMC schemes
run on transformed GM built upon the non-trivial BP solution, and our
experiments show that this synthesis of BP and MCMC outperforms both direct
MCMC and bare BP schemes.

It can be shown that even for the NC-scale as large as $10TeV$ the NC-effects

even more, that the number of edges that occur in a triangle is at least
$2\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$, and this bound is tight. They also showed that the
minimum number of edges that occur in a $C_{2k+1}$ for $k\ge2$ is at least
$11n^2/144-O(n)$, and conjectured that for any $k\ge2$, the correct lower bound
should be $2n^2/9-O(n)$. Very recently, F\""uredi and Maleki constructed a
counterexample for $k=2$ and proved asymptotically matching lower bound, namely
that for any $\varepsilon>0$ graphs with $(1+\varepsilon)n^2/4$ edges contain
at least $(2+\sqrt{2})n^2/16 \approx 0.2134n^2$ edges that occur in $C_5$.
  In this paper, we use a different approach to tackle this problem and obtain
the following stronger result: Any $n$-vertex graph with at least $\lfloor
n^2/4\rfloor+1$ edges has at least $(2+\sqrt{2})n^2/16-O(n^{15/8})$ edges that
occur in $C_5$. Next, for all $k\ge 3$ and $n$ sufficiently large, we determine
the exact minimum number of edges that occur in $C_{2k+1}$ for $n$-vertex
graphs with more than $n^2/4$ edges, and show it is indeed equal to
$\lfloor\frac{n^2}4\rfloor+1-\lfloor\frac{n+4}6\rfloor\lfloor\frac{n+1}6\rfloor=2n^2/9-O(n)$.
For both results, we give a structural description of the extremal
configurations as well as obtain the corresponding stability results, which
answer a conjecture of F\""uredi and Maleki.
  The main ingredient is a novel approach that combines the flag algebras
together with ideas from finite forcibility of graph limits. This approach
allowed us to keep track of the extra edge needed to guarantee an existence of
a $C_{2k+1}$. Also, we establish the first application of semidefinite method

describes deviations of the matter power spectrum from the dark-matter-only
case as a set of principal components that are localized in wavenumber and
redshift. We perform forecasts for a variety of current and future datasets,
and find that at least ~90% of the constraining power of these datasets is
contained in no more than nine principal components. The constraining power of
different surveys can be quantified using a figure of merit defined relative to
currently available surveys. With this metric, we find that the final Dark
Energy Survey dataset (DES Y5) and the Hyper Suprime Cam Survey will be roughly
an order of magnitude more powerful than existing data in constraining baryonic
effects. Upcoming Stage IV surveys (LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST) will improve upon
this by a further factor of a few. We show that this conclusion is robust to
marginalization over several key systematics. The ultimate power of cosmic
shear to constrain galaxy formation is dependent on understanding systematics
in the shear measurements at small (sub-arcminute) scales. If these systematics
can be sufficiently controlled, cosmic shear measurements from DES Y5 and other
future surveys have the potential to provide a very clean probe of galaxy
formation and to strongly constrain a wide range of predictions from modern

perturbation theory, based on the combination of an integration method and a
prediction technique. The former, which can be a numerical, analytical or
semianalytical theory, generates an initial approximation that contains some
inaccuracies derived from the fact that, in order to simplify the expressions
and subsequent computations, not all the involved forces are taken into account
and only low-order terms are considered, not to mention the fact that
mathematical models of perturbations not always reproduce physical phenomena
with absolute precision. The prediction technique, which can be based on either
statistical time series models or computational intelligence methods, is aimed
at modelling and reproducing missing dynamics in the previously integrated
approximation. This combination results in the precision improvement of
conventional numerical, analytical and semianalytical theories for determining
the position and velocity of any artificial satellite or space debris object.
In order to validate this methodology, we present a family of three hybrid
orbit propagators formed by the combination of three different orders of
approximation of an analytical theory and a statistical time series model, and
analyse their capability to process the effect produced by the flattening of
the Earth. The three considered analytical components are the integration of
the Kepler problem, a first-order and a second-order analytical theories,
whereas the prediction technique is the same in the three cases, namely an
additive Holt-Winters method.

distinct redshifted, blueshifted, and low velocity ejecta clumps or blobs. The
typical velocities of the redshifted and blueshifted blobs are <~ 7,800 km/s

individual blobs with both the ACIS-I and ACIS-S detectors. We determine the
three-dimensional kinematics of the Si- and Fe-rich clumps in the southeastern

of MoTe$_2$ through a Te flux method to validate these predictions through
measurements of its bulk Fermi surface (FS) \emph{via} quantum oscillatory
phenomena. We find that the superconducting transition temperature of
$\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ depends on disorder as quantified by the ratio between the
room- and low-temperature resistivities, suggesting the possibility of an
unconventional superconducting pairing symmetry. Similarly to WTe$_2$, the
magnetoresistivity of $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ does not saturate at high magnetic
fields and can easily surpass $10^{6}$ \%. Remarkably, the analysis of the de
Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) signal superimposed onto the magnetic torque, indicates
that the geometry of its FS is markedly distinct from the calculated one. The
dHvA signal also reveals that the FS is affected by the Zeeman-effect
precluding the extraction of the Berry-phase. A direct comparison between the
previous ARPES studies and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations reveals
a disagreement in the position of the valence bands relative to the Fermi level
$\varepsilon_F$. Here, we show that a shift of the DFT valence bands relative
to $\varepsilon_F$, in order to match the ARPES observations, and of the DFT
electron bands to explain some of the observed dHvA frequencies, leads to a
good agreement between the calculations and the angular dependence of the FS
cross-sectional areas observed experimentally. However, this relative
displacement between electron- and hole-bands eliminates their crossings and,
therefore, the Weyl type-II points predicted for $\gamma-$MoTe$_2$.

applicable when the dual formulation is not available, e.g. the

an unavoidable practical issue in the distributed system because of the

distributed optimization methods is highly dependent on the slowest machine. In
this paper, we address these two issues by proposing distributed asynchronous
dual free stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm for distributed
optimization. Our method does not need the dual formulation of the target
problem in the optimization. We tackle the straggler problem through
asynchronous communication and the negative effect of slow machines is
significantly alleviated. We also analyze the convergence rate of our method

it is more likely to conform to a specific class. Past methods that address

radical, often relying on data that is strictly discrete. Other methods rely on

We further subject such changes to fall within a certain level of cumulative
change (budget). Our framework can also accommodate the estimation of

in identification of alleles involved in complex diseases and cancer. To deal
with these massive data, elaborated sequence analysis pipelines are employed. A
core component of such pipelines is a read mapping module whose accuracy
strongly affects the quality of resulting variant calls.
  We propose a dynamic read mapping approach that significantly improves read
alignment accuracy. The general idea of dynamic mapping is to continuously
update the reference sequence on the basis of previously computed read
alignments. Even though this concept already appeared in the literature, we
believe that our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of this
approach.
  To evaluate the benefit of dynamic mapping, we developed a software pipeline
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas) that mimics different dynamic mapping
scenarios. The pipeline was applied to compare dynamic mapping with the
conventional static mapping and, on the other hand, with the so-called
iterative referencing - a computationally expensive procedure computing an
optimal modification of the reference that maximizes the overall quality of all
alignments. We conclude that in all alternatives, dynamic mapping results in a
much better accuracy than static mapping, approaching the accuracy of iterative
referencing.
  To correct the reference sequence in the course of dynamic mapping, we
developed an online consensus caller named OCOCO
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo). OCOCO is the first consensus caller
capable to process input reads in the online fashion.
  Finally, we provide conclusions about the feasibility of dynamic mapping and
discuss main obstacles that have to be overcome to implement it. We also review
a wide range of possible applications of dynamic mapping with a special
emphasis on variant detection.

connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of its individual
components to determine its collective function? We approach this question for
networks with linear time-invariant dynamics by relating internal network
feedbacks to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of
surprisingly simple and local statistics of connectivity. This results in a
reduced order model of the network input-output dynamics in terms of motifs
structures. As an example, the new formulation dramatically simplifies the
classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall network behavior to one
proportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. For general
networks, higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types
of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity
shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show
how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time
constant with which networks remember past signals. The theory also extends to
networks composed from heterogeneous nodes with distinct dynamics and
connectivity, and patterned input to (and readout from) subsets of nodes. These
statistical descriptions provide a powerful theoretical framework to understand
the functionality of real-world network systems, as we illustrate with examples
including the mouse brain connectome.

semi-detached Algol with parameters of $q$ = 0.243$\pm$0.001, $i$ =
77.3$\pm$0.3 deg, and $\Delta T$ = 3,372$\pm$58 K, in which the detached
primary component fills its Roche lobe by $\sim$87\%. A multiple frequency
analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light residuals reveals 33 frequencies in
the range of 0.75$-$20.22 d$^{-1}$ with amplitudes between 0.27 and 4.56 mmag.
Among these, four are pulsation frequencies in fundamental ($f_1$, $f_5$) and
$p$ ($f_2$, $f_7$) modes, and six are orbital frequency ($f_8$, $f_{31}$) and
its harmonics ($f_6$, $f_{11}$, $f_{20}$, $f_{24}$), which can be attributed to
tidally excited modes. For the pulsation frequencies, the pulsation constants
of 0.16$-$0.33 d and the period ratios of $P_{\rm pul}/P_{\rm orb}$ =
0.042$-$0.089 indicate that the primary component is a $\delta$ Sct pulsating
star and, thus, KIC 6220497 is an oscillating eclipsing Algol (oEA) star. The
dominant pulsation period of 0.1174051$\pm$0.0000004 d is significantly longer
than that expected from empirical relations that link the pulsation period with
the orbital period. The surface gravity of $\log g_1$ = 3.78$\pm$0.03 is
clearly smaller than those of the other oEA stars with similar orbital periods.
The pulsation period and the surface gravity of the pulsating primary
demonstrate that KIC 6220497 would be the more evolved EB, compared with normal
oEA stars.

temperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by
ambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity
$L_s\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a
temperature $T_{core}>6\times 10^8$ K. This scenario is viable if the core
magnetic field exceeds $10^{16}$ G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the
magnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of
such a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of
magnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be
quasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic
stresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal
stresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the
crust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent $L_s\approx
10^{35}$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario
of mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares. (3)
Ohmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is
inefficient because of the high conductivity of the crust. Only extreme
magnetic configurations with crustal fields $B>10^{16}$ G varying on a 100
meter scale could provide $L_s\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the
stellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism
produces hot spots on magnetars. Observations of transient magnetars show
evidence for external heating.

accretion flows onto massive black holes (BHs) with a very high rate. Assuming
that photon trapping limits the luminosity emerging from the central region to
$L\lesssim L_{\rm Edd}$, Inayoshi, Haiman & Ostriker (2016) have shown that an
accretion flow settles to a ""hyper-Eddington"" solution, with a steady and
isothermal ($T\simeq 8000$ K) Bondi profile reaching $\gtrsim 5000$ times the
Eddington accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}\equiv L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$. Here we
address the possibility that gas accreting with finite angular momentum forms a
bright nuclear accretion disc, with a luminosity exceeding the Eddington limit
($1\lesssim L/L_{\rm Edd}\lesssim 100$). Combining our simulations with an
analytic model, we find that a transition to steady hyper-Eddington accretion
still occurs, as long as the luminosity remains below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\lesssim
35~(M_{\rm BH}/10^4~M_\odot)^{3/2}(n_\infty/10^5~{\rm

where $n_\infty$ and $T_\infty$ are the density and temperature of the ambient
gas, and $r_\star$ is the radius of the photosphere, at which radiation
emerges. If the luminosity exceeds this value, accretion becomes episodic. Our
results can be accurately recovered in a toy model of an optically thick
spherical shell, driven by radiation force into a collapsing medium. When the
central source is dimmer than the above critical value, the expansion of the
shell is halted and reversed by ram pressure of the collapsing medium, and by
shell's weight. Our results imply that rapid, unimpeded hyper-Eddington
accretion is possible even if the luminosity of the central source far exceeds
the Eddington limit, and can be either steady or strongly episodic.

even under the case of high potential barriers. At the barrier interface, the
perfect matching of electron and hole wavefunctions enables a unit transmission
probability for normally incident electrons. It is theoretically and
experimentally well understood in two-dimensional relativistic materials such
as graphene. Here we investigate the Klein tunneling effect in Weyl semimetals
under the influence of magnetic field induced by anti-symmetric ferromagnetic
stripes placed at barrier boundaries. Our results show that the resonance of
Fermi wave vector at specific barrier lengths gives rise to perfect
transmission rings, i.e., three-dimensional analogue of the so-called magic
transmission angles in two-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Besides, the
transmission profile can be shifted by application of magnetic field, a
property which may be utilized in electro-optic applications. When the applied
potential is close to the Fermi level, a particular incident vector can be
selected for transmission by tuning the applied magnetic field, thus enabling
highly selective transmission of electrons in the bulk of Weyl semimetals. Our
analytical and numerical calculations obtained by considering Dirac electrons
in three regions and using experimentally feasible parameters can pave the way
for relativistic tunneling applications in Weyl semimetals.

polarization energy of string configurations in models similar to the standard
model of particle physics. The central observation underlying this
corroboration is the existence of a particular global isospin transformation of
the string configuration. Under this transformation the single particle
energies of the quantum fluctuations are invariant, while the inevitable
implementation of regularization and renormalization requires operations that
are not invariant. We verify numerically that all such variances eventually
cancel, and that the vacuum polarization energy obtained in the spectral
approach is indeed gauge invariant.

optimal stopping problems and interact through the proportion of players that
have already stopped. Working with a continuum of agents, typical equilibria
become functions of the common noise that all agents are exposed to, whereas
idiosyncratic randomness can be eliminated by an Exact Law of Large Numbers.
Under a structural monotonicity assumption, we can identify equilibria with
solutions of a simple equation involving the distribution function of the
idiosyncratic noise. Solvable examples allow us to gain insight into the
uniqueness of equilibria and the dynamics in the population.

  abstract field to 1920 characters",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.NE math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition of
multiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvex
objective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such ""nested""
functions is the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). MAC introduces an
auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model
into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that
alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has
the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces
parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with
nondifferentiable layers. With large-scale problems, or when distributing the
computation is necessary for faster training, the dataset may not fit in a
single machine. It is then essential to limit the amount of communication
between machines so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. We
describe a general way to achieve this, ParMAC. ParMAC works on a cluster of
processing machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until
convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic
updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel
parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines.
ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates
data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.
We study the convergence of ParMAC and propose a theoretical model of its
runtime and parallel speedup. We develop ParMAC to learn binary autoencoders
for fast, approximate image retrieval. We implement it in MPI in a distributed
system and demonstrate nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster with
a training set of 100 million high-dimensional points.

In order to efficiently segment the contaminated image, this paper proposes a
two step method based on the hybrid total variation model with a box constraint

on the weighted convex combination between the total variation functional and
the high-order total variation as the regularization term to obtain the
original clustering data. In order to deal with non-smooth regularization term,
we solve this model by employing the alternating split Bregman method. Then, in
the second step, the segmentation can be obtained by thresholding this

using the K-means clustering method. Numerical comparisons show that our

affects the gas-grain chemistry in molecular clouds by promoting molecule
desorption, diffusion, and chemical reactions on grain surfaces. The frequency
of such heating $f_T$, s$^{-1}$, determines how often a certain temperature
$T_{\rm CR}$, K, is reached for grains hit by CR particles. This study aims to
provide astrochemists with comprehensive and updated dataset on the CR-induced
whole-grain heating. We present calculations of $f_T$ and $T_{\rm CR}$ spectra
for bare olivine grains with radius $a$ of 0.05; 0.1; 0.2 $\mu$m, and such
grains covered with ice mantles of thickness 0.1$a$ and 0.3$a$. Grain shape and
structure effects are considered, as well as 30 CR elemental constituents with
an updated energy spectrum corresponding to a translucent cloud with $A_V=2$
mag. Energy deposition by CRs in grain material was calculated with the SRIM
program. We report full $T_{\rm CR}$ spectra for all nine grain types and
consider initial grain temperatures of 10 K and 20 K. We also provide
frequencies for a range of minimum $T_{\rm CR}$ values. The calculated dataset
can be simply and flexibly implemented in astrochemical models. The results
show that, in the case of translucent clouds, the currently adopted rate for
heating of whole grains to temperatures in excess of 70 K is underestimated by
approximately two orders of magnitude in astrochemical numerical simulations.
Additionally, grains are heated by CRs to modest temperatures (20--30 K) with
intervals of a few years, which reduces the possibility of ice chemical
explosions.

understand how realistic, scale-dependent systematics bias cosmic shear and
dark energy measurements, and how they can be removed. Here we describe how
spatial variations in the amplitude and orientation of realistic image
distortions convolve with the measured shear field, mixing the even-parity
convergence and odd-parity modes, and bias the shear power spectrum. Many of
these biases can be removed by calibration to external data, the survey itself,
or by modelling in simulations. The uncertainty in the calibration must be
marginalised over and we calculate how this propagates into parameter
estimation, degrading the dark energy Figure-of-Merit. We find that noise-like
biases affect dark energy measurements the most, while spikes in the bias power
have the least impact, reflecting their correlation with the effect of
cosmological parameters. We argue that in order to remove systematic biases in
cosmic shear surveys and maintain statistical power effort should be put into
improving the accuracy of the bias calibration rather than minimising the size
of the bias. In general, this appears to be a weaker condition for bias
removal. We also investigate how to minimise the size of the calibration set
for a fixed reduction in the Figure-of-Merit. These results can be used to
model the effect of biases and calibration on a cosmic shear survey accurately,
assess their impact on the measurement of modified gravity and dark energy
models, and to optimise surveys and calibration requirements.

  Completely Random Trees",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates an important problem in stream mining, i.e.,
classification under streaming emerging new classes or SENC. The common
approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a
supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative
approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The
SENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging new
classes, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enable
classification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging new
classes. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have been
shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning
independently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know,
that completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve all
three sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model update
in data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method
often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing
classification-focused methods.

rate in one- and two-color laser pulse fields is investigated by solving the
quantum Vlasov equation. A small frequency chirp shifts the momentum spectrum
along the momentum axis. The positive and negative frequency chirp parameters
play the same role in increasing the pair number density. The sign change of
frequency chirp parameter at the moment $t=0$ leads pulse shape and momentum
spectrum to be symmetric, and the number density to be increased. The number
density of produced pairs in the two-color pulse field is much higher than that
in the one-color pulse field and the larger frequency chirp pulse field
dominates more strongly. In the two-color pulse fields, the relation between
the frequency ratio of two colors and the number density is not sensitive to
the parameters of small frequency chirp added in either low frequency strong

square. The intercloud is described using the standard solutions for the
advection-dominated accretion flows. Orbit of a cloud decays because of the
drag force, but the typical time scale of falling of clouds onto the central
black hole is shorter comparing to the linear drag case. This time scale is
calculated when a cloud is moving through a static or rotating intercloud. We
show that when the drag force is a quadratic function of the velocity,

aerodynamically and the particle-to-gas feedback is included. We find a
dispersion relation for axisymmetric linear disturbances and growth rate of the
unstable modes are calculated numerically. While the secular gravitational
instability in the absence of particle-to-gas feedback predicts the dust layer
is unstable, magnetic fields significantly amplifies the instability if the
Toomre parameter for the gas component is fixed. We also show that even a weak
magnetic field is able to amplify the instability more or less irrespective of
the dust-gas coupling.

  envelopes","21 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.CG math.HO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GeoGebra is an open source mathematics education software tool being used in
thousands of schools worldwide. Since version 4.2 (December 2012) it supports
symbolic computation of locus equations as a result of joint effort of
mathematicians and programmers helping the GeoGebra developer team. The joint
work, based on former researches, started in 2010 and continued until present
days, now enables fast locus and envelope computations even in a web browser in
full HTML5 mode. Thus, classroom demonstrations and deeper investigations of
dynamic analytical geometry are ready to use on tablets or smartphones as well.
  In our paper we consider some typical secondary school topics where
investigating loci is a natural way of defining mathematical objects. We
discuss the technical possibilities in GeoGebra by using the new commands
LocusEquation and Envelope, showing through different examples how these
commands can enrich the learning of mathematics. The covered school topics
include definition of a parabola and other conics in different situations like
synthetic definitions or points and curves associated with a triangle. Despite
the fact that in most secondary schools, no other than quadratic curves are
discussed, simple generalization of some exercises, and also every day
problems, will smoothly introduce higher order algebraic curves. Thus our paper
mentions the cubic curve ""strophoid"" as locus of the orthocenter of a triangle
when one of the vertices moves on a circle. Also quartic ""cardioid"" and sextic
""nephroid"" can be of every day interest when investigating mathematics in, say,
a coffee cup.
  We also focus on GeoGebra specific tips and tricks when constructing a
geometric figure to be available for getting the locus equation. Among others,
simplification and synthetization (via the intercept theorem) are mentioned.

manipulation of spin current for logic operations. The approach followed so
far, inspired by the seminal proposal of the Datta and Das spin modulator, has
relied on the spin-orbit field as a medium for electrical control of the spin
state. However, the still standing challenge is to find a material whose
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) is weak enough to transport spins over long

manipulation. Here we demonstrate a radically different approach by engineering
a heterostructure from atomically thin crystals, which are ""glued"" by weak van
der Waals (vdW) forces and which combine the superior spin transport properties
of graphene with the strong SOC of the semiconducting MoS$_{2}$. The spin
transport in the graphene channel is modulated between ON and OFF states by
tuning the spin absorption into the MoS$_{2}$ layer with a gate electrode. Our
demonstration of a spin field-effect transistor using two-dimensional (2D)
materials identifies a new route towards spin logic operations for beyond CMOS
technology.

Conceptually, computed time-space distributions of the so-called tissue density
can be compared with the measured data obtained from CT; such a modeling
feedback can be used for model parameter identification. The blood flow is
characterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in
upper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using
simple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by correction terms
to respect the local pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and
in the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium
defined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by
hydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic
veins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. The
contrast fluid saturation is governed by transport equations adapted for the 1D
and 3D flow models. The complex perfusion model has been implemented using the
finite element and finite volume methods. We report numerical examples computed
for anatomically relevant geometries of the liver organ and of the principal
vascular trees. The simulated tissue density corresponding to the CT

in modern photonics, achieve waveguiding through near-field coupling between
tightly localized resonators. The coupling factor, a critical parameter in CROW
theory, determines the coupling strength between two resonators and the
waveguiding dispersion of a CROW. However, the original CROW theory proposed by
Yariv et al. only demonstrated one value of coupling factor for a multipole
resonance mode. Here, by imaging the tight-binding Bloch waves on a CROW
consisting of designer-surface-plasmon resonators in the microwave regime, we
demonstrate that the coupling factor in the CROW theory can reverse its sign
for a multipole resonance mode. This determines two different waveguiding
dispersion curves in the same frequency range, experimentally confirmed by
matching Bloch wavevectors and frequencies in the CROW. Our study supplements

K2-39b (EPIC 206247743b). With an orbital period of 4.6 days, it is the
shortest-period planet orbiting a subgiant star known to date. Such planets are
rare, with only a handful of known cases. The reason for this is poorly
understood, but may reflect differences in planet occurrence around the
relatively high-mass stars that have been surveyed, or may be the result of
tidal destruction of such planets. K2-39 is an evolved star with a
spectroscopically derived stellar radius and mass of
$3.88^{+0.48}_{-0.42}~\mathrm{R_\odot}$ and
$1.53^{+0.13}_{-0.12}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, respectively, and a very close-in
transiting planet, with $a/R_\star = 3.4$. Radial velocity (RV) follow-up using
the HARPS, FIES and PFS instruments leads to a planetary mass of
$50.3^{+9.7}_{-9.4}~\mathrm{M_\oplus}$. In combination with a radius
measurement of $8.3 \pm 1.1~\mathrm{R_\oplus}$, this results in a mean
planetary density of $0.50^{+0.29}_{-0.17}$ g~cm$^{-3}$. We furthermore
discover a long-term RV trend, which may be caused by a long-period planet or
stellar companion. Because K2-39b has a short orbital period, its existence
makes it seem unlikely that tidal destruction is wholly responsible for the
differences in planet populations around subgiant and main-sequence stars.
Future monitoring of the transits of this system may enable the detection of
period decay and constrain the tidal dissipation rates of subgiant stars.

  We have found that IRC +10420 presents high abundances of the N-bearing

of a N-rich chemistry, expected for massive stars. Our analysis also suggests a
decrease of the 12C/13C ratio from \gtrsim 7 to \sim 3.7 in the last 3800
years, which can be directly related to the nitrogen enrichment observed. In
addition, we found that SiO emission presents a significant intensity decrease

modeling shows that this variation can be explained by a decrease in the
infrared (IR) flux of the dust. The origin of this decrease might be an
expansion of the dust shell or a lower stellar temperature due to the pulsation

inappropriate size of the license has on spectrum assignments lead to spectrum
being simply wasted in geography, time and frequency or not being assigned in a

Most attempts involve the better understanding of double-peaked narrow emission
line sources, to distinguish the objects where the emission lines originate
from narrow-line kinematics or jet-driven outflows from those which might
harbour dual AGN. We observed four such candidate sources with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.5 GHz with $\sim$ 10 milli-arcsecond angular
resolution where spectral profiles of AGN optical emission suggested the
existence of dual AGN. In SDSS J210449.13-000919.1 and SDSS J23044.82-093345.3,
the radio structures are aligned with the optical emission features, thus the
double-peaked emission lines might be the results of jet-driven outflows. In
the third detected source SDSS J115523.74+150756.9, the radio structure is less
extended and oriented nearly perpendicular to the position angle derived from
optical spectroscopy. The fourth source remained undetected with the VLBA but
it has been imaged with the Very Large Array at arcsec resolution a few months

limits: (i) when the dot phonon modes are out of equilibrium, and (ii) when the
dot phonon modes are strongly coupled to a heat bath. In the first case, a
detailed analysis of the physics related to the interplay between the quantum
dot level quantization, the on-site Coulomb interaction and the electron-phonon
coupling on the thermoelectric performance reveals that an n-type heat engine
performs better than a p-type heat engine. In the second case, with the aid of
the dot temperature estimated by incorporating a {\it{thermometer bath}}, it is
shown that the dot temperature deviates from the bath temperature as
electron-phonon interaction becomes stronger. Consequently, it is demonstrated
that the dot temperature controls the direction of phonon heat currents,
thereby influencing the thermoelectric performance. Finally, the conditions on
the maximum efficiency with varying phonon couplings between the dot and all

random forest (RF) models. RF is a popular and useful tool for non-linear
multi-variate classification and regression, which yields a good trade-off
between robustness (low variance) and adaptiveness (low bias). Direct
interpretation of a RF model is difficult, as the explicit ensemble model of
hundreds of deep trees is complex. Nonetheless, it is possible to visualize a
RF model fit by its mapping from feature space to prediction space. Hereby the
user is first presented with the overall geometrical shape of the model
structure, and when needed one can zoom in on local details. Dimensional
reduction by projection is used to visualize high dimensional shapes. The
traditional method to visualize RF model structure, partial dependence plots,
achieve this by averaging multiple parallel projections. We suggest to first
use feature contributions, a method to decompose trees by splitting features,
and then subsequently perform projections. The advantages of forest floor over
partial dependence plots is that interactions are not masked by averaging. As a
consequence, it is possible to locate interactions, which are not visualized in
a given projection. Furthermore, we introduce: a goodness-of-visualization
measure, use of colour gradients to identify interactions and an out-of-bag
cross validated variant of feature contributions.

formation process in medical imaging modalities like X-ray Computerized
Tomography and Positron Emission Tomography. The Hough transform is a pattern
recognition technique, which is mainly used to detect straight lines in digital
images and which has been recently extended to the automatic recognition of
algebraic plane curves. Although defined in very different ways, in numerical
applications both transforms ultimately take an image as an input and provide,
as an output, a function defined on a parameter space. The parameters in this
space describe a family of curves, which represent either the integration
domains considered in the (generalized) Radon transform, or the curves to be
detected by means of the Hough transform. In both cases, the 2D plot of the
intensity values of the output function is the so-called (Radon or Hough)
sinogram. While the Hough sinogram is produced by an algorithm whose
implementation requires that the parameter space be discretized in cells, the
Radon sinogram is mathematically defined on a continuous parameter space, which
in turn may need to be discretized just for physical or numerical reasons. In
this paper, by considering a more general and n-dimensional setting, we prove
that, whether the input image is described as a set of points (possibly with
different intensity values) or as a piecewise constant function, its (rescaled)
Hough sinogram converges to the corresponding Radon sinogram as the
discretization step in the parameter space tends to zero. We also show that
this result may have a notable impact on the image reconstruction problem of
inverting the Radon sinogram recorded by a medical imaging scanner, and that
the description of the Hough transform problem within the framework of
regularization theory for inverse problems is worth investigating.

behavior is determined by the competition between the mean energy difference

solvent. At low temperatures, solvent molecules are bound to the polymer and
the solvophobicity of the polymer is screened, resulting in a coiled state. At
high temperatures the entropy loss due to bound solvent offsets the energy gain
due to binding which causes the solvent molecules to unbind, leading to the
collapse of the polymer chain to a globular state. Furthermore, the coarse
grained nature of these models indicates that mean interaction energies are
sufficient to explain LCST in comparison to specific solvent structural
arrangements.

different nuclear equations of state (EoSs). From our simulations covering up
to ~350 ms after bounce, we show that the development of the standing accretion
shock instability (SASI) differs significantly depending on the stiffness of
nuclear EoS. Generally, the SASI activity occurs more vigorously in models with
softer EoS. By evaluating the gravitational-wave (GW) emission, we find a new
GW signature on top of the previously identified one, in which the typical GW
frequency increases with time due to an accumulating accretion to the
proto-neutron star (PNS). The newly observed quasi-periodic signal appears in
the frequency range from ~100 to 200 Hz and persists for ~150 ms before
neutrino-driven convection dominates over the SASI. By analyzing the cycle
frequency of the SASI sloshing and spiral modes as well as the mass accretion
rate to the emission region, we show that the SASI frequency is correlated with
the GW frequency. This is because the SASI-induced temporary perturbed mass
accretion strike the PNS surface, leading to the quasi-periodic GW emission.
Our results show that the GW signal, which could be a smoking-gun signature of
the SASI, is within the detection limits of LIGO, advanced Virgo, and KAGRA for
Galactic events.

eigenstates appear locally thermal. Integrable systems, on the other hand,
possess an extensive number of such conserved quantities and hence the reduced
density matrix requires specification of an infinite number of parameters

sampling of the individual eigenstates with a given finite energy density, that

density of the eigenstate. Rare eigenstates that cannot be represented by the
Gibbs ensemble can also be sampled efficiently by our method and their local

Generalized Gibbs Ensembles. We further show that the presence of these rare
eigenstates differentiates the model from the generic (non-integrable) case and
leads to the system being described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble at long

cell. Cargo (proteins, vesicles, organelles, etc.) is transferred from its
place of creation to its target locations via molecular motor assisted
transport along cytoskeletal filaments. The transport efficiency is strongly
affected by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton, which constitutes an
inhomogeneous, complex network. In cells with a centrosome microtubules grow
radially from the central microtubule organizing center towards the cell
periphery whereas actin filaments form a dense meshwork, the actin cortex,
underneath the cell membrane with a broad range of orientations. The emerging
ballistic motion along filaments is frequently interrupted due to constricting
intersection nodes or cycles of detachment and reattachment processes in the
crowded cytoplasm. In order to investigate the efficiency of search strategies
established by the cell's specific spatial organization of the cytoskeleton we
formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. With
extensive computer simulations we analyze the dependence of the mean first
passage times for narrow escape problems on the structural characteristics of
the cytoskeleton, the motor properties and the fraction of time spent in each
state. We find that an inhomogeneous architecture with a small width of the
actin cortex constitutes an efficient intracellular search strategy.

The technique relies on covering the object of interest with a shell that

out-of-phase. The resulting destructive interference prohibits its detection in
measurements that probe the scattered light. Whereas at radio or microwave
frequencies feasible designs have been proposed that allow to tune the
operational frequency upon request, similar capabilities have not yet been
explored in the visible. However, such ability is decisive to capitalize on the
technique in many envisioned applications. Here, we solve the problem and study
the use of small metallic nanoparticles with an ellipsoidal shape as the
material from which the shell is made to build an isotropic geometry. Changing
the aspect ratio of the ellipsoids allows to change the operational frequency.
The basic functionality is explored with two complementary analytical
approaches. Additionally, we present a powerful multiscattering algorithm that
can be used to perform full wave simulations of clusters of arbitrary

given the extreme luminosities of Wolf-Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic
models for WR 98a, where dust creation and redistribution are self-consistently
incorporated. Our grid-adaptive simulations resolve details in the wind
collision region at scales below one percent of the orbital separation (~4 AU),
while simulating up to 1300 AU. We cover several orbital periods under
conditions where the gas component alone behaves adiabatic, or is subject to
effective radiative cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between stellar
winds is effective in a well-defined spiral pattern, where optimal conditions
for dust creation are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the
interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities along the wind collision
region, and dust concentrates in clumps and filaments in a volume-filling
fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the
rotating pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future E-ELT observations
and confront photometric long-term monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the
dust distribution between leading and trailing edge of the spiral, show that
ALMA and E-ELT would be able to detect fine-structure in the spiral indicative
of Kelvin-Helmholtz development, and confirm the variation in photometry due to
the orientation. Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their resolution is

general linear measurements instead of point-wise pressure values. A main

recovered. For that purpose we develop the concept of sparsifying temporal
transforms for three-dimensional photoacoustic tomography. We establish a
two-stage algorithm that recovers the complete pressure Signals in a first step

This yields a novel reconstruction method with much lower complexity than
existing compressed sensing approaches for photoacoustic tomography.

to the period of the optical Rabi oscillations due to the interaction between
the resonant excitation and the atomic levels. Our theory gives access to
various statistical properties of the fluorescence light, including one showing

Trajectories (LPTs) providing a unified description of resonant energy
transport in a wide range of classical and quantum dynamical systems with
constant and time-varying parameters. It is shown that strongly modulated
non-stationary processes occurring in a nonlinear oscillator array under
certain initial conditions may characterize either maximum possible energy
exchange between the clusters of oscillators (effective particles) or maximum
energy transfer from an external source of energy to the system. The
trajectories corresponding to these processes are referred to as LPTs. The
development and the use of the LPT concept are motivated by the fact that
highly non-stationary resonance processes occurring in a broad variety of
finite-dimensional physical models are beyond the well-known paradigm of the
nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), fully justified only for stationary processes,
their stability and bifurcations, as well as for non-stationary processes
described approximately by some combinations of non-resonating normal modes.
Thus, the role of LPTs in understanding and description of non-stationary
energy transfer is similar to the role of NNMs for the stationary processes.
Several applications of the LPT concept to significant nonlinear problems and a
scenario of the transition from regular to chaotic behavior with the LPTs
implication are presented. In order to highlight the novelty and perspectives
of the developed approach, we place the LPT concept into the context of complex
dynamical phenomena related to energy transfer problems.

Moreover, a disruption of hese mechanisms is frequently postulated as a
possible cause of diseases such as Alzheimer's or cancer. For many of
biologically relevant cases the structure of protein-protein complexes remain
unknown. Therefore computational techniques, including molecular docking, have
become a valuable part of drug discovery pipelines. Unfortunately, none of the
widely used protein-protein docking tools is free from serious limitations.
Typically, in docking simulations the protein flexibility is either completely
neglected or very limited. Additionally, some knowledge of the approximate
location and/or the shape of the active site is also required. Such limitations
arise mostly from the enormous number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein
systems. In this paper, an efficient computational method for protein-protein
docking is proposed and initially tested on a single docking case. The proposed
method is based on a two-step procedure. In the first step, CABS-dock web
server for protein-peptide docking is used to dock a peptide, which is the
appropriate protein fragment responsible for the protein-protein interaction,
to the other protein partner. During peptide docking, no knowledge about the
binding site, nor the peptide structure, is used and the peptide is allowed to
be fully flexible. In the second step, the docked peptide is used in the
structural adjustment of protein complex partners. The proposed method allowed
us to obtain a high accuracy model, therefore it provides a promising framework
for further advances.

method allows for full flexibility of the peptide, whereas the flexibility of
the receptor is restricted to near native conformations considering the main
chain, and full flexibility of the side chains. Performance of the CABS-dock
server was thoroughly tested on a benchmark of 171 test cases, both bound and

and phase damping channel, as well as to the recently introduced generalized
depolarizing channel. As a criterion for the classical-like behavior we use the
least entropy production, i.e. the total correlation in the system. The
classical-like collective behavior is found for short time intervals for
strongly interacting qubits. Only in a certain trivial case we observe the
simultaneous collective and individual-qubits classical- ity. Observation
(non-observation) of the collective (individual) classicality can reveal the
kind and strength of the qubits interaction or the ratio of the qubits'
energy-gaps, while manipulating the qubits interaction (by tuning the strength
and/or refocussing) can give rise to the desired kind of classicality.

scale-free networks. During resting-state, we assess Degree exponents across a
large range of neurotypical and atypical subjects. We use graph complexity

We show that neurotypical resting-state fMRI brain activity possess scale-free

more transparent in these experiments because of the negligibly small ratio

neutrinos to oscillate, and thus can be sensitive to the new physics at the
both ends. We use data from two electron-neutrino electron scattering

conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting
from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure.
This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance
between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent
variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that
encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of
the more general framework of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). In the first
generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a
network. We term this framework Latent Network Modeling (LNM) and show that,
with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between
latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second
generalization, the residual variance-covariance structure of indicators is
modeled as a network. We term this generalization Residual Network Modeling
(RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained
in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations
allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare,
SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This
methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet,
which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search
algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and
penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in
simulation studies that these search algorithms performs adequately in
identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We
further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical
example on a personality inventory dataset.

Lagrangian relabeling symmetry of fluids is absent for polymers (while the
translational and rotational symmetries are still present). This fact results
in spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry in fluid turbulence even at
a tiny polymer addition. Since helicity conservation in inviscid fluid motions
is a consequence of the relabeling symmetry (due to the Noether's theorem)
violation of this conservation by the polymer additives results in the strong
effects in the distributed chaos. The distributed chaos in turbulence with the
spontaneously broken relabeling symmetry is characterized by stretched
exponential spectra $\propto \exp(-k/k_{\beta})^{\beta}$ with $\beta =2/5$. The
spectral range of this distributed chaos is extended in direction of the small
wavenumbers and $k_{\beta}$ becomes much larger in comparison with the pure
fluid (Newtonian) case. This results in substantial suppression of small-scale
turbulence and large-scale mixing enhancement. Good agreement with results of
direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental data has been established
for a channel flow (DNS), for Rayleigh-Taylor turbulent convection (DNS) and
for Rayleigh-Benard turbulent convection (experiment).

profiles, omitting the service sector. Realistic assessment of the potential
for renewable resource integration in cities requires models that include
detailed demand and generation profiles. Detailed generation profiles are
available for many resources. Detailed demand profiles, however, are currently
only available for households and not for the service sector. This paper
addresses this gap. The paper (1) proposes a novel approach to devise synthetic
service sector demand profiles based on a combination of a large number of
different data sources, and (2) uses these profiles to study the impact of the
service sector on the potential for renewable resource integration in urban
energy systems, using the Netherlands as a case study. The importance of the
service sector is addressed in a broad range of solar and wind generation
scenarios, and in specific time and weather conditions (in a single scenario).
Results show that including the service sector leads to statistically
significantly better estimations of the potential of renewable resource
integration in urban areas. In specific time and weather conditions, including
the service sector results in estimations that are up to 33% higher than if
only households are considered. The results can be used by researchers to
improve urban energy systems models, and by decision-makers and practitioners
for grid planning, operation and management}.

empirical research has been done to date to investigate technological and
individual personal factors that determine the success or failure of enterprise
gamification initiatives. In this article, we provide a summary of our
preliminary research findings from three case studies of gamification
initiatives across different business contexts and present an empirically
validated descriptive framework that details the key success factors for
enterprise gamification. Our adaptation of the mechanics, dynamics, and
aesthetics (MDA) framework for enterprise gamification aims to explicate the
connections between end-user motivations, interactive gameplay elements, and
technology features and functions that constitute effective gamification
interventions in the enterprise. Following a discussion of the core elements in
the framework and their interrelationships, the implications of our research
are presented in the form of guidelines for the management and design of
gamification initiatives and applications. The research findings presented in
this article can potentially aid in the development of game mechanics that
translate into positive user experiences and foster higher levels of employee
engagement. Additionally, our research findings provide insights on key success

implications for the content and the evolution of the universe. However, in
order to realise the full potential of these surveys, we need to ensure that we
are using the correct analysis: a relativistic analysis, which has been widely
studied recently. In this work, the known relativistic overdensity of galaxy
surveys is re-examined. Unlike in previous works, a consistent approach for
incorporating both the relativistic number-count overdensity and the
relativistic cosmic magnification overdensity in the total observed overdensity
of a generic survey, is presented. Since in practice, analyses are often done
for specific sample types (flux-limited or volume-limited) the approach in this
work allows for the total observed overdensity to be easily reduced to either
of the individual overdensities by applying the same limiting conditions as for
extracting the corresponding data samples. This is not obvious, or in some
cases not possible, with the results of previous works. Thus, the calculations
in this work serve to generalise the expression for the total observed
overdensity. However, care must be taken to apply it appropriately: the type of
the data sample in consideration needs to be taken into account.

consider that the stellar object is spherically symmetric, static and
anisotropic in nature and follows the density profile given by Mak and Harko

properties of the ultra-dense strange stars we have employed the MIT bag model
for the quark matter. Our investigation displays an interesting feature that
the anisotropy of compact stars increases with the radial coordinate and
attains its maximum value at the surface which seems an inherent property for
the singularity free anisotropic compact stellar objects. In this connection we
also perform several tests for physical features of the proposed model and show
that these are reasonably acceptable within certain range. Further, we find
that the model is consistent with the energy conditions and the compact stellar
structure is stable with the validity of the TOV equation and Herrera cracking
concept. For the masses bellow the maximum mass point in mass vs radius curve
