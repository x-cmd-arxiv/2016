of Levy differential operators is studied. The value of the stochastic Levy
Laplacian is found by means of Cesaro averaging of directional derivatives on
the stochastic parallel transport. It is shown that the Yang-Mills equations
and the Levy-Laplace equation for such Laplacian are not equivalent as in the
deterministic case. An equation equivalent to the Yang-Mills equations is
obtained. The equation contains the stochastic Levy divergence. It is proved
that the Yang-Mills action functional can be represented as an
infinite-dimensional analogue of the Direchlet functional of chiral field. This
analogue is also derived using Cesaro averaging.

gas clouds, some associated with the dense, massive star-forming core NGC6334
I, and others with diffuse foreground clouds. For the former category, we aim
to study the dynamical properties of the clouds in order to assess their
potential to feed the accreting protostellar cores.
  Methods. We use spectral imaging from the Herschel SPIRE iFTS to construct a
map of HF absorption at 243 micron in a 6x3.5 arcmin region surrounding NGC6334
I and I(N).
  Results. The combination of new, spatially fully sampled, but spectrally
unresolved mapping with a previous, single-pointing, spectrally resolved HF
signature yields a 3D picture of absorbing gas clouds in the direction of
NGC6334. Toward core I, the HF equivalent width matches that of the spectrally
resolved observation. The distribution of HF absorption is consistent with
three of the seven components being associated with this dense star-forming
envelope. For two of the remaining four components, our data suggest that these
clouds are spatially associated with the larger scale filamentary star-forming
complex. Our data also implies a lack of gas phase HF in the envelope of core
I(N). Using a simple description of adsorption onto and desorption from dust
grain surfaces, we show that the overall lower temperature of the envelope of
source I(N) is consistent with freeze-out of HF, while it remains in the gas
phase in source I.
  Conclusions. We use the HF molecule as a tracer of column density in diffuse
gas (n(H) ~ 10^2 - 10^3 cm^-3), and find that it may uniquely trace a
relatively low density portion of the gas reservoir available for star
formation that otherwise escapes detection. At higher densities prevailing in
protostellar envelopes (>10^4 cm^-3), we find evidence of HF depletion from the
gas phase under sufficiently cold conditions.

  In this work we investigate the specific aromatic content of Titan's
atmospheric aerosols through laboratory simulations. We report here the
selective detection of aromatic compounds in tholins, Titan's aerosol
analogues, produced with a capacitively coupled plasma in a N2:CH4 95:5 gas

Resonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) using a {\lambda}=248 nm
wavelength laser which is selective for aromatic species. This allows for the
selective identification of compounds having at least one aromatic ring. Our
experiments show that tholins contain a trace amount of small PAHs with one to
three aromatic rings. Nitrogen containing PAHs (PANHs) are also detected as
constituents of tholins. Molecules relevant to astrobiology are detected as is
the case of the substituted DNA base adenine.

change in the dominant relevant plasmon mode, from the resonant transverse
plasmon at low thicknesses to the nonresonant ""lightning rod"" mode at higher

overlayer and whether the Ge degrades the Au plasmonic properties, we
investigate the photothermal response (from the temperature-dependent Au

using a cross-sectional, finite element simulation. The no-gap structures and

In this paper we first formalize an SNR criterion to design an estimator, and
then we prove that there exists an equivalence between MMSE and maximum-SNR
estimators, for any statistics. We also extend this equivalence to specific
classes of suboptimal estimators, which are expressed by a basis expansion
model (BEM). Then, by exploiting an orthogonal BEM for the estimator, we derive
the MMSE estimator constrained to a given quantization resolution of the noisy
observations, and we prove that this suboptimal MMSE estimator tends to the
optimal MMSE estimator that uses an infinite resolution of the observation.
Besides, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean-squared error (MSE) and
for the SNR of the proposed suboptimal estimators, and we show that these
expressions constitute tight, asymptotically exact, bounds for the optimal MMSE

topology-preserving mapping from the (usually high dimensional) input/feature
space to an output/map space of fewer dimensions (usually two or three in order
to facilitate visualization). Neurons in the output space are connected with
each other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning is
achieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space.
Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structure
limitation they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removal
of a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposed
called AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates
a more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during
training and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid
by allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments using
multiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves training
performance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset and
provides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of

transitive graphs is a wide and important one. The subclass of Cayley graphs is
of particular interest, as testifies the development of geometric group theory.
Recall that Cayley graphs can be defined as non-empty locally finite connected
graphs endowed with a transitive group action such that any non-identity
element acts without fixed point.
  We define a class of transitive graphs which are transitive in an ""absolutely
non-Cayley way"": we consider graphs endowed with a transitive group action such
that any element of the group acts with a fixed point. We call such graphs
""rotarily transitive graphs"", and we show that, even though there is no finite
rotarily transitive graph with at least 2 vertices, there is an infinite
locally finite connected rotarily transitive graph. The proof is based on
groups built by Ivanov which are finitely generated, of finite exponent and
have a small number of conjugacy classes.
  We also build infinite transitive graphs (which are not locally finite) any
automorphism of which has a fixed point. This is done by considering ""unit
distance graphs"" associated with the projective plane over suitable subfields
of the real numbers.

external Abelian magnetic field, and a bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD)

We find that, in general, energy loss and momentum diffusion through strongly
coupled anisotropic plasmas are enhanced by a magnetic field being larger in
transverse directions than in the direction parallel to the magnetic field.
Moreover, the anisotropic shear viscosity coefficient is smaller in the
direction of the magnetic field than in the plane perpendicular to the field,
which indicates that strongly coupled anisotropic plasmas become closer to the
perfect fluid limit along the magnetic field. We also present, in the context

varying spectral models and observed energy ranges influence estimated white
dwarf mass. Observations of the inner 10 pc can be accounted for by IPs with
$\langle M_{\rm WD} \rangle \approx 0.9 M_\odot$, consistent with that of the
CV population in general, and the X-ray observed field IPs in particular. The
lower mass derived by Chandra and XMM-Newton appears to be an artifact of
narrow energy band fitting. To explain the (unresolved) CHXE by IPs requires an
X-ray (2-8 keV) luminosity function (XLF) extending down to at least
$5\times10^{31}$ erg/s. The CHXE XLF, if extended to the surrounding ~50 pc
observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton, requires at least ~20-40% of the $\sim$9000
point sources are IPs. If the XLF extends just a factor of a few lower in
luminosity, then the vast majority of these sources are IPs. This is in
contrast to recent observations of the Galactic ridge, where the bulk of the

yields the birnessite type oxide, Na0.36MnO2 0.2H2O, transforming its magnetic
properties. This compound has a much-expanded interlayer spacing compared to
its parent a-NaMnO2 compound. We show that while the parent a-NaMnO2 possesses
a Neel temperature of 45 K as a result of broken symmetry in the Mn3+

within the Mn3+/Mn4+ sub-lattice. Scaling-law analysis of the frequency
dispersion of the AC susceptibility, as well as the temperature-dependent,

interacting spins. This is supported by complementary spectroscopic analysis
(HAADF-STEM, EDS, EELS) as well as by a structural investigation
(high-resolution TEM, X-ray and neutron powder diffraction) that yield insights

spin-glass state in birnessite is driven by the spin-frustration imposed by the
underlying triangular lattice topology that is further enhanced by the in-plane
bond-disorder generated by the mixed-valent character of manganese in the

admits low frequency regime transitions between zonal and dipolar states. Such
transitions in the model were first studied by Bouchet and Simonnet (2009) and
are reminiscent of regime change phenomena in the weather and climate systems
wherein extreme and abrupt qualitative changes occur, seemingly randomly, after
long periods of apparent stability. Mechanisms underlying regime transitions in
the model are not well understood yet. From the point of view of atmospheric
and oceanic dynamics, a novel aspect of the model is the lack of any source of
background gradient of potential-vorticity such as topography or planetary
gradient of rotation rate (e.g., as in Charney & DeVore '79).
  We consider perturbations that are embedded onto the system's chaotic
attractor under the full nonlinear dynamics as bred vectors---nonlinear
generalizations of the leading (backward) Lyapunov vector. We find that
ensemble predictions that use bred vector perturbations are more robust in
terms of error-spread relationship than those that use Lyapunov vector
perturbations. In particular, when bred vector perturbations are used in
conjunction with a simple data assimilation scheme (nudging to truth), we find
that at least some of the evolved perturbations align to identify
low-dimensional subspaces associated with regions of large forecast error in
the control (unperturbed, data-assimilating) run; this happens less often in
ensemble predictions that use Lyapunov vector perturbations. Nevertheless, in
the inertial regime we consider, we find that (a) the system is more
predictable when it is in the zonal regime, and that (b) the horizon of
predictability is far too short compared to characteristic time scales
associated with processes that lead to regime transitions, thus precluding the
possibility of predicting such transitions.

The associated enhanced local fields may be employed in the manipulation of
light on the nanoscale by adjusting the separation between the graphene layers,
the energy band gap as well as the concentration of charge carriers in the
conducting media surrounding the two-dimensional (2D) layers. We present a
theoretical formalism, based on the calculation of the surface response
function, for determining the plasmon spectrum of an encapsulated pair of 2D
layers and apply it to graphene. We solve the coupled equations involving the
continuity of the electric potential and discontinuity of the electric field at
the interfaces separating the constituents of the hybrid structure. We have
compared the plasmon modes for encapsulated gapped and gapless graphene. The
associated nonlocal graphene plasmon spectrum coupled to the ""sandwich"" system
show a linear acoustic plasmon mode as well as a low-frequency mode
corresponding to in-phase oscillations of the adjacent 2D charge densities.
These calculations are relevant to the study of energy transfer via plasmon
excitations when graphene is confined by a pair of thick conducting materials.

important question, since many experiments reveal the near-glassy nature of the

assemblies of active particles, parametrised by a self-propulsion force, $f_0$,
and persistence time, $\tau_p$, appear to make contradictory predictions about
the influence of activity on characteristic features of glass, such as
fragility. This calls for a broad conceptual framework to understand active
glasses; here we extend the Random First-Order Transition (RFOT) theory to a
dense assembly of self-propelled particles. We compute the active contribution
to the configurational entropy using an effective medium approach - that of a
single particle in a caging-potential. This simple active extension of RFOT
provides excellent quantitative fits to existing simulation results. We find
that whereas $f_0$ always inhibits glassiness, the effect of $\tau_p$ is more
subtle and depends on the microscopic details of activity. In doing so, the
theory automatically resolves the apparent contradiction between the simulation
models. The theory also makes several testable predictions, which we verify by
both existing and new simulation data, and should be viewed as a step towards a
more rigorous analytical treatment of active glass.

challenges. First, kernel compression is only possible when the kernel matrices
are separable, and in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
NMR sequences with non-separable kernels. Second, in three or more dimensions,
the singular value decomposition is not unique; therefore kernel compression is
not well-defined for higher dimensions. Without kernel compression, the
Kronecker product yields matrices that require large amounts of memory, making
the inversion intractable for personal computers. Finally, incorporating
arbitrary regularization terms is not possible using the Lawson-Hanson (LH) or

to perform multidimensional NMR inversion without using kernel compression or
Kronecker products. The new method is memory efficient, requiring less than
0.1% of the memory required by the LH or BRD methods. It can also be extended
to arbitrary dimensions and adapted to include non-separable kernels, linear
constraints, and arbitrary regularization terms. Additionally, it is easy to
implement because only a cost function and its first derivative are required to
perform the inversion.

focusing on the granular phase is presented, and validated with experiments.
The model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully
rough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs.
A discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one
dimensional volume-averaged two-phase momentum equation for the fluid phase.
The coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase
is discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload
transport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is
proposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared
with experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a
function of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume
fraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport
experiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical
3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the
granular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale
mechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model
allows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence
of the granular parameters on the macroscopic results are weak. Nevertheless,
the analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the
depth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction
coefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.

Galaxy by spectral analysis of background point sources in the absorption-only
limit to the radiative transfer equation. In this limit, calculating the
spectral index, $\alpha$, of these sources using a natural logarithm results in
an additive factor, which we denote $\alpha_\mathrm{EM}$, resulting from the
absorption of radiation due to the Galactic thermal electron population. We
find that this effect is important at very low frequencies ($\nu\lesssim200$
MHz), and that the frequency spacing is critical.
  We model this effect by calculating the emission measure across the sky. A
(smooth) thermal electron model for the Galaxy does not fit the observed
emission measure distribution, but a simple, cloud-based model to represent the
clumpy nature of the warm interstellar medium does. This model statistically
reproduces the Galactic emission measure distribution as obtained independently
from $H_\alpha$ data well.
  We find that at the lowest frequencies ($\sim10-50$ MHz), the observed
spectral index for a large segment of the Galaxy below Galactic latitudes of
$\lesssim15^\circ$ could be changed significantly (i.e.,
$\alpha_\mathrm{EM}\gtrsim0.1$).
  This method therefore provides a correction to low-frequency spectral index
measurements of extragalactic sources, and provides a sensitive probe of the
thermal electron distribution of the Galaxy using current and next-generation
low-frequency radio telescopes.
  We show that this effect should be robustly detectable individually in the
strongest sources, and statistically in source samples at a level of
$\alpha_\mathrm{EM}\gtrsim0.18,0.06$, and 0.02 for source densities of 10, 100
and 1,000 sources per square degree.

special function known as an elliptic hypergeometric integral (EHI). The
high-temperature limit of the index corresponds to the hyperbolic limit of the
EHI. The hyperbolic limit of certain special EHIs has been analyzed by Eric
Rains around 2006; extending Rains's techniques, we discover a surprisingly
rich structure in the high-temperature limit of a (rather large) class of EHIs
that arise as the superconformal index of unitary Lagrangian 4d SCFTs with
non-chiral matter content. Our result has implications for $\mathcal{N}=1$
dualities, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and supersymmetric gauge dynamics on
$R^3\times S^1$.
  We also investigate the high-temperature asymptotics of the large-N limit of
the superconformal index of a class of holographic 4d SCFTs (described by toric
quiver gauge theories with SU(N) nodes). We show that from this study a rather
general solution to the problem of holographic Weyl anomaly in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$

consist of line-of-sight velocities for ~$3500$ GCs, measured with a high
precision of ~15 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$ per GC and extending out to $~13 R_{\rm e}$.
We obtain the mass distribution in each galaxy using the tracer mass estimator
of Watkins et al. and account for kinematic substructures, rotation of the GC
systems and galaxy flattening in our mass estimates.
  The observed scatter between our mass estimates and results from the
literature is less than 0.2 dex. The dark matter fraction within $5R_{\rm e}$
($f_{\rm DM}$) increases from ~$0.6$ to ~$0.8$ for low- and high-mass galaxies,
respectively, with some intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_*{\sim}10^{11}M_\odot$)
having low $f_{\rm DM}\sim0.3$, which appears at odds with predictions from
simple galaxy models. We show that these results are independent of the adopted
orbital anisotropy, stellar mass-to-light ratio, and the assumed slope of the
gravitational potential. However, the low $f_{\rm DM}$ in the ~$10^{11}M_\odot$
galaxies agrees with the cosmological simulations of Wu et al. where the
pristine dark matter distribution has been modified by baryons during the
galaxy assembly process. We find hints that these $M_*\sim10^{11}M_\odot$
galaxies with low $f_{\rm DM}$ have very diffuse dark matter haloes, implying
that they assembled late. Beyond $5R_{\rm e}$, the $M/L$ gradients are steeper
in the more massive galaxies and shallower in both low and intermediate mass
galaxies.

evidence has been provided showing that these models are able to fit the main
cosmological data (SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB) significantly better than the
concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, the vacuum parameters of the RVM
(i.e. those responsible for the dynamics of the vacuum energy) prove to be
nonzero at a confidence level $\gtrsim3\sigma$. Here we use such remarkable
status of the RVM's to make definite predictions on the cosmic time variation
of the fundamental constants. It turns out that the predicted variations are
close to the present observational limits. Furthermore, we find that the time
variation of the dark matter particles should be crucially involved in the
total mass variation of our Universe. A positive measurement of this kind of
effects could be interpreted as strong support to the ""micro and macro

intense manifestations of tightly packed magnetic field lines, with
near-vertical field strengths exceeding 6,000 G in extreme cases. It is well
accepted that both the plasma density and the magnitude of the magnetic field
strength decrease rapidly away from the solar surface, making high-cadence
coronal measurements through traditional Zeeman and Hanle effects difficult
since the observational signatures are fraught with low-amplitude signals that
can become swamped with instrumental noise. Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
techniques have previously been applied to coronal structures, with single and
spatially isolated magnetic field strengths estimated as 9-55 G. A drawback
with previous MHD approaches is that they rely on particular wave modes
alongside the detectability of harmonic overtones. Here we show, for the first
time, how omnipresent magneto-acoustic waves, originating from within the
underlying sunspot and propagating radially outwards, allow the spatial
variation of the local coronal magnetic field to be mapped with high precision.
We find coronal magnetic field strengths of 32 +/- 5 G above the sunspot, which
decrease rapidly to values of approximately 1 G over a lateral distance of 7000
km, consistent with previous isolated and unresolved estimations. Our results
demonstrate a new, powerful technique that harnesses the omnipresent nature of
sunspot oscillations to provide magnetic field mapping capabilities close to a
magnetic source in the solar corona.

the accretion disk and produce a reflection signal that evolves as the burst
fades. Examining the evolution of reflection features in the spectra will give
insight into the burst-disk interaction, a potentially powerful probe of
accretion disk physics. At present, reflection has been observed during only
two bursts of exceptional duration. We investigate the detectability of
reflection signatures with four of the latest well-studied X-ray observatory
concepts: Hitomi, NICER, Athena, and LOFT. Burst spectra are modeled for
different values for the flux, temperature, and the disk ionization parameter,
which are representative for most known bursts and sources. The effective area
and through-put of a Hitomi-like telescope are insufficient for characterizing
burst reflection features. NICER and Athena will detect reflection signatures
in Type I bursts with peak fluxes $\ge 10^{-7.5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and
also effectively constrain the reflection parameters for bright bursts with
fluxes of $10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in exposures of several seconds.
Thus, these observatories will provide crucial new insight into the interaction
of accretion flows and X-ray bursts. For sources with low line-of-sight
absorption, the wide band-pass of these instruments allows for the detection of
soft X-ray reflection features, which are sensitive to the disk metallicity and
density. The large collecting area that is part of the LOFT design would
revolutionize the field by tracing the evolution of the accretion geometry in
detail throughout short bursts.

a tight veto on accompanying hadronic jets to divide the data into two mutually
exclusive event samples (jet bins). For a resonance of several hundred GeV, the
jet binning cut needed to discriminate quark and gluon initial states is in the
experimentally accessible range of several tens of GeV. It also yields
comparable cross sections for both bins, making this method viable already with
the small event samples available shortly after a discovery. Theoretically, the
method is made feasible by utilizing an effective field theory setup to compute
the jet cut dependence precisely and model independently and to systematically
control all sources of theoretical uncertainties in the jet binning, as well as
their correlations. We use a 750 GeV scalar resonance as an example to
demonstrate the viability of our method.

lines of the high ionisation species He II/N IV/C IV during the first 2-3 d
after explosion, traces of a metal-rich CSM probably due to pre-explosion mass
loss events. These disappear by day 9 and the spectral evolution then continues
matching that of normal Type II SNe. The post-maximum light curve declines at a
rate typical of Type II-L class. The extensive photometric coverage tracks the
drop from the photospheric stage and constrains the radioactive tail, with a
steeper decline rate than that expected from the $^{56}$Co decay if
$\gamma$-rays are fully trapped by the ejecta. We report the appearance of an
unusual feature on the blue-side of H$\alpha$ after 100 d, which evolves to
appear as a flat spectral feature linking H$\alpha$ and the O I doublet. This
may be due to interaction of the ejecta with a strongly asymmetric, and
possibly bipolar CSM. Finally, we report two deep spectra at ~190 and 340 d
after explosion, the latter being arguably one of the latest spectra for a Type
II-L SN. By modelling the spectral region around the Ca II, we find a
supersolar Ni/Fe production. The strength of the O I $\lambda\lambda$6300,6363

$^{56}$Ni production of ~0.023 M$_\odot$. Its photospheric evolution is similar
to other Type II SNe, with shallow absorption in the H{\alpha} profile typical
for a Type IIL. During transition to the radioactive decay tail at ~100 days,
we find the SN to grow bluer in B - V colour, in contrast to some other Type II
supernovae. At late times, the bolometric light curve declined faster than
expected from $^{56}$Co decay and we observed unusually broad and asymmetric
nebular emission lines. Based on comparison of nebular emission lines most
sensitive to the progenitor core mass, we find our observations are best
matched to synthesized spectral models with a M$_\rm{ZAMS}$ = 12 - 15 M$_\odot$

estimated for Type IIP progenitors. This is against the idea that Type IIL are

a general method to overcome this problem which is robust against foreground
residual noise and based on the cross-correlation function $\psi_{\alpha L}(r)$
between diffuse line emission and Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAE). We compute the
diffuse line (Ly$\alpha$ is used as an example) emission from galaxies in a

populate them with $14000(5500)$ LAEs at $z = 5.7(6.6)$, considering duty
cycles from $10^{-3}$ to $1$. Both the LAE number density and slice volume are
consistent with the expected outcome of the Subaru HSC survey. We add gaussian
random noise with variance $\sigma_{\rm N}$ up to 100 times the variance of the
Ly$\alpha$ emission, $\sigma_\alpha$, to simulate foregrounds and compute
$\psi_{\alpha L}(r)$. We find that the signal-to-noise of the observed
$\psi_{\alpha L}(r)$ does not change significantly if $\sigma_{\rm N} \le 10
\sigma_\alpha$ and show that in these conditions the mean line intensity,
$I_{Ly\alpha}$, can be precisely recovered independently of the LAE duty cycle.
Even if $\sigma_{\rm N} = 100 \sigma_\alpha$, $I_\alpha$ can be constrained

general $L$. We employ the weak-noise theory - a variant of WKB approximation
-- which yields the optimal history of the interface, conditioned on reaching
the given height $H$ at the origin at time $t$. We find that at small $H$
$\mathcal{P}(H,t,L)$ is Gaussian, but its tails are non-Gaussian and highly
asymmetric. In the leading order and in a proper moving frame, the tails behave
as $-\ln \mathcal{P}= f_{+}|H|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$ and $f_{-}|H|^{3/2}/t^{1/2}$. The
factor $f_{+}(L,t)$ monotonically increases as a function of $L$, interpolating
between time-independent values at $L=0$ and $L=\infty$ that were previously
known. The factor $f_{-}$ is independent of $L$ and $t$, signalling
universality of this tail for a whole class of deterministic initial
conditions.

about 10 in twenty days. We analyse XMM-Newton and Swift data.
XMMSL1J063045.9-603110 shows several features typical of tidal disruption
events: the X-ray spectrum shows the characteristics of a spectrum arising from
a thermal accretion disc, the flux decay follows a t^-5/3 law, and the flux
variation is > 350. Optical observations testify that XMMSL1J063045.9-603110 is
probably associated with an extremely small galaxy or even a globular cluster,

static and dynamical fidelity, respectively. The static fidelity applies to
quantum problems which can be diagonalized since it is defined via the
eigenfunctions. In particular, we show that the static fidelity is a highly
effective practical detector of avoided crossings characterizing the complexity
of the systems and their evolutions. The dynamical fidelity is defined via the
time-dependent wave functions. Focussing on the quantum kicked rotor system, we
highlight a few practical applications of fidelity measurements in order to

low-dimensional system with mixed regular-chaotic phase space.

images per second) that were stacked using the shift-and-add technique to
produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). The high precision
photometry was performed via difference image analysis employing the DanDIA
pipeline. We attempted automatic detection of variable stars in the field.
  We statistically analysed the light curves of 1405 stars in the crowded
central region of NGC~6715 to automatically identify the variable stars present
in this cluster. We found light curves for 17 previously known variable stars

evolution and nucleosynthetic origins of these elements, yet remains relatively
unexplored. At low metallicities (12+log(O/H) < 8.0), nebular carbon
measurements are limited to rest-frame UV collisionally excited emission lines.
Therefore, we present UV spectrophotometry of 12 nearby, low-metallicity,
high-ionization HII regions in dwarf galaxies obtained with the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We present the first analysis of
the C/O ratio in local galaxies based solely on simultaneous significant
detections of the UV O^+2 and C^+2 collisionally excited lines in seven of our
targets and five objects from the literature, to create a final sample of 12
significant detections. Our sample is complemented by optical SDSS spectra,
from which we measured the nebular physical conditions and oxygen abundances
using the direct method.
  At low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.0), no clear trend is evident in C/O vs.
O/H for the present sample given the large dispersion observed. When combined
with recombination line observations at higher values of O/H, a general trend
of increasing C/O with increasing O/H is also viable, but with some significant
outliers. Additionally, we find the C/N ratio appears to be constant (but with
significant scatter) over a large range in oxygen abundance, indicating carbon
is predominantly produced by similar nucleosynthetic mechanisms as nitrogen. If
true, and our current understanding of nitrogen production is correct, this

extends traditional topic models by learning a factorized latent variable
representation. The structured representation leads to a model that marries
benefits traditionally associated with a discriminative approach, such as
feature selection, with those of a generative model, such as principled
regularization and ability to handle missing data. The factorization is
provided by representing data in terms of aligned pairs of observations as
different views. This provides means for selecting a representation that
separately models topics that exist in both views from the topics that are
unique to a single view. This structured consolidation allows for efficient and
robust inference and provides a compact and efficient representation. Learning
is performed in a Bayesian fashion by maximizing a rigorous bound on the
log-likelihood. Firstly, we illustrate the benefits of the model on a synthetic
dataset,. The model is then evaluated in both uni- and multi-modality settings
on two different classification tasks with off-the-shelf convolutional neural
network (CNN) features which generate state-of-the-art results with extremely

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) identify their projected magnetic field lines and provide
key data for understanding the physics of accretion and outflow from

produced with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Because VLBI
incompletely samples the Fourier transform of the source image, any image
reconstruction that fills in unmeasured spatial frequencies will not be unique
and reconstruction algorithms are required. In this paper, we explore
extensions of the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to linear polarimetric VLBI
imaging. In contrast to previous work, our polarimetric MEM algorithm combines
a Stokes I imager that uses only bispectrum measurements that are immune to
atmospheric phase corruption with a joint Stokes Q and U imager that operates
on robust polarimetric ratios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
technique on 7- and 3-mm wavelength quasar observations from the VLBA and
simulated 1.3-mm Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A* and M87.
Consistent with past studies, we find that polarimetric MEM can produce
superior resolution compared to the standard CLEAN algorithm when imaging
smooth and compact source distributions. As an imaging framework, MEM is highly
adaptable, allowing a range of constraints on polarization structure.
Polarimetric MEM is thus an attractive choice for image reconstruction with the
EHT.

conclude that the YORP-induced rotational fission hypothesis can be consistent
with the observed population statistics of small asteroids in the main belt
including binaries and contact binaries. The foundation of this model is the
asteroid rotation model of Marzari et al. (2011), which incorporates both the
YORP effect and collisional evolution. This work adds to that model the
rotational fission hypothesis and the binary evolution model of Jacobson &
Scheeres (2011). The asteroid population evolution model is highly constrained
by these and other previous works, and therefore it has only two significant
free parameters: the ratio of low to high mass ratio binaries formed after
rotational fission events and the mean strength of the binary YORP (BYORP)
effect. We successfully reproduce characteristic statistics of the small
asteroid population: the binary fraction, the fast binary fraction,
steady-state mass ratio fraction and the contact binary fraction. We find that
in order for the model to best match observations, rotational fission produces
high mass ratio ($> 0.2$) binary components with four to eight times the
frequency as low mass ratio ($< 0.2$) components, where the mass ratio is the
mass of the secondary component divided by the mass of the primary component.
This is consistent with post-rotational fission binary system mass ratio being
drawn from either a flat or a positive and shallow distribution, since the high
mass ratio bin is four times the size of the low mass ratio bin; this is in
contrast to the observed steady-state binary mass ratio, which has a negative
and steep distribution. This can be understood in the context of the
BYORP-tidal equilibrium hypothesis, which predicts that low mass ratio binaries
survive for a significantly longer period of time than high mass ratio systems.

s-process simulations that adopt a treatment of convective boundaries based on
the results of hydrodynamic simulations and on the theory of mixing due to
gravity waves in the vicinity of convective boundaries. Hydrodynamics
simulations suggest the presence of convective boundary mixing (CBM) at the
bottom of the thermal pulse-driven convective zone. Similarly,
convection-induced mixing processes are proposed for the mixing below the
convective envelope during third dredge-up where the 13C pocket for the s
process in AGB stars forms. In this work we apply a CBM model motivated by
simulations and theory to models with initial mass $M = 2$ and $M = 3M_\odot$,
and with initial metal content Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02. As reported previously,
the He-intershell abundance of 12C and 16O are increased by CBM at the bottom
of pulse-driven convection zone. This mixing is affecting the
$^{22}Ne(\alpha,n)^{25}Mg$ activation and the s-process effciency in the
13C-pocket. In our model CBM at the bottom of the convective envelope during
the third dredgeup represents gravity wave mixing. We take further into account
that hydrodynamic simulations indicate a declining mixing efficiency already
about a pressure scale height from the convective boundaries, compared to
mixing-length theory. We obtain the formation of the 13C-pocket with a mass of
$\approx 10^{-4}M_\odot$. The final $s$-process abundances are characterized by
0.36 < [s=Fe] < 0.78 and the heavy-to-light s-process ratio is 0.23 < [hs=ls] <
0.45. Finally, we compare our results with stellar observations, pre-solar

construct parent body and dust distributions that informed scattered-light

of a planet-perturbed disk. Briefly, our results indicate a disk parent body
population with a semimajor axis of 40-52 AU and an interior planet with an

infinite ascending or descending sequence. This has been studied extensively in
the reverse mathematics literature, beginning with the work of Hirschfeldt and
Shore. We introduce the principle $ADC$, which asserts that linear order has an
infinite ascending or descending chain. The two are easily seen to be
equivalent over the base system $RCA_0$ of second order arithmetic; they are
even computably equivalent. However, we prove that $ADC$ is strictly weaker
than $ADS$ under Weihrauch (uniform) reducibility. In fact, we show that even
the principle $SADS$, which is the restriction of $ADS$ to linear orders of
type $\omega + \omega^*$, is not Weihrauch reducible to $ADC$. In this
connection, we define a more natural stable form of $ADS$ that we call
$General\text-SADS$, which is the restriction of $ADS$ to linear orders of type
$k + \omega$, $\omega + \omega^*$, or $\omega + k$, where $k$ is a finite
number. We define $GeneralSADC$ analogously. We prove that $GeneralSADC$ is not
Weihrauch reducible to $SADS$, and so in particular, each of $SADS$ and $SADC$
is strictly weaker under Weihrauch reducibility than its general version.
Finally, we turn to the principle $CAC$, which asserts that every partial order
on $\omega$ has an infinite chain or antichain. This has two previously studied
stable variants, $SCAC$ and $WSCAC$, which were introduced by Hirschfeldt and
Jockusch, and by Jockusch, Kastermans, Lempp, Lerman, and Solomon,

have received significant attention in the research community. A closely
related important aspect of the problem -- quantification of statistical
significance of overlap of clusters, remains relatively unexplored. This paper
presents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying
statistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such
problems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network
analysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the
statistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper
assigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about
both the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the
corresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is
demonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications
and is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges.
  Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and
biological networks. We show that our framework: (i) derives insight from both
the density and the size of overlap among communities (circles/pathways), (ii)
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods over all tested datasets, and
(iii) when compared to other measures, has much broader application scope. In
the context of social networks, we identify highly interdependent (social)
circles and show that our predictions are highly co-enriched with known user
features. In networks of biomolecular interactions, we show that our method
identifies novel cross-talk between pathways, sheds light on their mechanisms
of interaction, and provides new opportunities for investigations of
biomolecular interactions.

seeks to define a measure $\mu^h = e^{\gamma h(z)} dz$ where $h$ is an instance
of the Gaussian free field on a planar domain $D$. Since $h$ is a distribution,
not a function, one needs a regularization procedure to make this precise: for
example, one may let $h_\epsilon(z)$ be the average value of $h$ on the circle
of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $z$ (or an analogous average defined using a
bump function supported inside that circle) and then write $\mu^h =
\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon^{\frac{\gamma^2}{2}} e^{\gamma h_\epsilon(z)}
dz$.
  If $\phi: \tilde D \to D$ is a conformal map, one can write $\tilde h = h
\circ \phi + Q \log |\phi'|$, where $Q = 2/\gamma + \gamma/2$. The measure
$\mu^{\tilde h}$ on $\tilde D$ is then a.s.\ equivalent to the pullback via
$\phi^{-1}$ of the measure $\mu^h$ on $D$. Interestingly, although this a.s.\
holds for each \textit{given} $\phi$, nobody has ever proved that it a.s.\
holds \textit {simultaneously} for all possible $\phi$. We will prove that this
is indeed the case. This is conceptually important because one frequently
defines a \textit{quantum surface} to be an equivalence class of pairs $(D, h)$
(where pairs such as the $(D,h)$ and $(\tilde D, \tilde h)$ above are
considered equivalent) and it is useful to know that the set of pairs
$(D,\mu^{h})$ obtained from the set of pairs $(D,h)$ in an equivalence class is
itself an equivalence class with respect to the usual measure pullback
relation.

their mechanical properties, an aspect often overlooked in the literature on
composites. This contribution analyzes, experimentally and numerically, the
intra-laminar size effect of textile composite structures. Test results of
geometrically similar Single Edge Notched specimens made of 8 layers of 0
degree epoxy/carbon twill 2 by 2 laminates are reported. Results show that the
nominal strength decreases with increasing specimen size and that the
experimental data can be fitted well by Bazant's size effect law, allowing an
accurate identification of the intra-laminar fracture energy of the material.
The importance of an accurate estimation of Gf in situations where
intra-laminar fracturing is the main energy dissipation mechanism is clarified
by studying numerically its effect on crashworthiness of composite tubes.
Simulations demonstrate that, for the analyzed geometry, a decrease of the
fracture energy to 50% of the measured value corresponds to an almost 42%
decrease in plateau crushing load. Further, assuming a vertical stress drop
after the peak, a typical assumption of strength-based constitutive laws
implemented in most commercial Finite Element codes, results in an strength
underestimation of the order of 70%. The main conclusion of this study is that
measuring accurately fracture energy and modeling correctly the fracturing
behavior of textile composites, including their quasi-brittleness, is key. This
can be accomplished neither by strength- or strain-based approaches, which
neglect size effect, nor by LEFM which does not account for the finiteness of
the Fracture Process Zone.

Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) for the simulation of the
pressure-dependent inelastic response of granular rocks. LDPM is formulated in
the framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous
deformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete
compatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical
strategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual
grain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are
illustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone,
i.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale.
LDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial
experiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low
confinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM
allows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic
response of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a
wide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its
capability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified
mechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety
of geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may
constitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for
granular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their
complex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum
models capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.

Unfortunately, computation on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices

able to handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing a
lower-dimensional SPD manifold. To this end, we propose to model the mapping

orthonormal projection. This lets us formulate dimensionality reduction as the
problem of finding a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold either
with maximum discriminative power in the supervised scenario, or with maximum
variance of the data in the unsupervised one. We show that learning can be
expressed as an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold and discuss fast
solutions for special cases. Our evaluation on several classification tasks
evidences that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over

topology of the interactions between the entities. To better understand the
roles played by the entities in the system one needs to uncover the underlying
community structure of the system. In recent years, systems with interactions
that have various types or can change over time between the entities have
attracted an increasing research attention. However, algorithms aiming to solve
the key problem - community detection - in multilayer networks are still
limited. In this work, we first introduce the multilayer network model
representation with multiple aspects, which is flexible to a variety of
networks. Then based on this model, we naturally derive the multilayer
modularity - a widely adopted objective function of community detection in
networks - from a static perspective as an evaluation metric to evaluate the
quality of the communities detected in multilayer networks. It enables us to
better understand the essence of the modularity by pointing out the specific
kind of communities that will lead to a high modularity score. We also propose
a spectral method called mSpec for the optimization of the proposed modularity
function based on the supra-adjacency representation of the multilayer
networks. Experiments on the electroencephalograph network and the comparison

decorated ZnS nanorod sensor showed stronger response to ethanol than the

nanorod sensors to 200 ppm of ethanol at 300oC were 2.9 and 13.8, respectively.
Furthermore, under these conditions, the decorated nanorod sensor showed longer
response time (23 s) and shorter recovery time (20 s) than those of the

of the decorated nanorod sensor (42 s) was shorter than that of the pristine

ethanol over other volatile organic compound gases including acetone, methanol,
benzene, toluene, whereas the pristine one failed to show selectivity to
ethanol over acetone. The improved sensing performance of the decorated nanorod
sensor is attributed to the modulation of the conduction channel width and the
potential barrier height at the ZnS Cr2O3 interface accompanying the adsorption

the decorated nanorods than the pristine one due to the existence of the ZnS

positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace, is an important optimization
task with many applications in optimization, machine learning, and signal
processing. It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since
standard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is
the conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much
interest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific
setting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix
decompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector
computation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the
CG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for
minimizing a $\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like
$\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also
strongly convex.
  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex
optimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method
is essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single
eigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\alpha$-strongly convex
and $\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method
after $t$ iterations is: $$O\left({\min\{\frac{\beta{}}{t}
,\left({\frac{\beta\sqrt{\textrm{rank}(\textbf{X}^*)}}{\alpha^{1/4}t}}\right)^{4/3},
\left({\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\alpha}\lambda_{\min}(\textbf{X}^*)t}}\right)^{2}\}}\right)
,$$ where $\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for a
CG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouraging
preliminary empirical results.

symmetric matrix enters into the action. The advantage of this fact is twofold.
First, as compared to Plebanski's action, the symmetric matrix can now be
integrated out, which leads to a pure $BF$-type action principle for general
relativity; the canonical analysis of the new action then shows that it has the
same phase space of the Ashtekar formalism up to a canonical transformation
induced by a topological term. Second, a particular choice of the parameters
involved in the formulation produces a $BF$-type action principle describing
conformally anti-self-dual gravity. Therefore, the new action unifies both

poloidal field through decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar active regions and
the generation of toroidal field through the observed differential rotation.
These models are traditionally known as flux transport dynamo models as the
equatorward propagations of the butterfly wings in these models are produced
due to an equatorward flow at the bottom of the convection zone. Here we
investigate the role of downward magnetic pumping near the surface using a
kinematic Babcock-Leighton model. We find that the pumping causes the poloidal
field to become predominately radial in the near-surface shear layer, which
allows the negative radial shear to effectively act on the radial field to
produce a toroidal field. We observe a clear equatorward migration of the
toroidal field at low latitudes as a consequence of the dynamo wave even when
there is no meridional flow in the deep convection zone. Both the dynamo wave
and the flux transport type solutions are thus able to reproduce some of the
observed features of the solar cycle, including the 11-year periodicity. The
main difference between the two types of solutions is the strength of the
Babcock-Leighton source required to produce the dynamo action. A second
consequence of the magnetic pumping is that it suppresses the diffusion of
fields through the surface, which helps to allow an 11-year cycle at
(moderately) larger values of magnetic diffusivity than have previously been
used.

gates by supplementing optimal tuning of individual qubits with dynamical
decoupling (DD) of local 1/f noise. We consider simultaneous local pulse
sequences applied during the gate operation and compare the efficiencies of
periodic, Carr-Purcell and Uhrig DD with hard $\pi$-pulses along two directions
($\pi_{z/y}$ pulses). We present analytical perturbative results (Magnus
expansion) in the quasi-static noise approximation combined with numerical
simulations for realistic 1/f noise spectra. The gate efficiency is studied as
a function of the gate duration, of the number $n$ of pulses, and of the
high-frequency roll-off. We find that the gate error is non-monotonic in $n$,
decreasing as $n^{-\alpha}$ in the asymptotic limit, $\alpha \geq 2$ depending
on the DD sequence. In this limit $\pi_z$-Urhig is the most efficient scheme
for quasi-static 1/f noise, but it is highly sensitive to the soft UV-cutoff.
For small number of pulses, $\pi_z$ control yields anti-Zeno behavior, whereas
$\pi_y$ pulses minimize the error for a finite $n$. For the current noise
figures in superconducting qubits, two-qubit gate errors $\sim 10^{-6}$,

and high Z targets show above-barrier suppression of complete fusion. This has
been interpreted as resulting from breakup of the weakly bound nucleus prior to
reaching the fusion barrier, reducing the probability of complete fusion. This
paper investigates how these conclusions are affected by lifetimes of the
resonant states that are populated prior to breakup. If the mean life of a
populated resonance is much longer than the fusion timescale, then its breakup
cannot suppress complete fusion. For short-lived resonances, the situation is
more complex. This work includes the mean life of the short-lived 2+ resonance
in 8Be in classical dynamical model calculations to determine its effect on
energy and angular correlations of the breakup fragments and on predictions of
fusion suppression. Coincidence measurements of breakup fragments produced in
reactions of 9Be with 144Sm, 168Er, 186W, 196Pt, 208Pb and 209Bi at energies
below the barrier are re-analysed. Predictions of breakup observables and of
complete and incomplete fusion at energies above the fusion barrier are made
using the classical dynamical simulation code PLATYPUS, modified to include the
lifetimes of short-lived resonant states. The agreement of the breakup
observables is improved when lifetime effects are included. The predicted
suppression of complete fusion due to breakup is nearly independent of Z, with
an average value of 9%, below the experimentally determined fusion suppression
of 30% in these systems. This more realistic treatment of breakup leads to the
conclusion that the suppression of complete fusion cannot be fully explained by
breakup prior to reaching the fusion barrier. Other mechanisms that can
suppress complete fusion must be investigated. A candidate is cluster transfer
that produces the same nuclei as incomplete fusion.

discrepancy between the observed and modelled thermal emission at far-infrared

model underestimates the observed fluxes by a factor of about two. We compare
two different dust models, and find that dust parameters and thus the spectral

task in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for a
variety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like a
plausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexity
of 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, since
most 3D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do not
increase proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting in
wasted computation. In this work, we represent 3D spaces as volumetric fields,
and propose a novel design that employs field probing filters to efficiently
extract features from them. Each field probing filter is a set of probing
points --- sensors that perceive the space. Our learning algorithm optimizes
not only the weights associated with the probing points, but also their
locations, which deforms the shape of the probing filters and adaptively
distributes them in 3D space. The optimized probing points sense the 3D space
""intelligently"", rather than operating blindly over the entire domain. We show
that field probing is significantly more efficient than 3DCNNs, while providing
state-of-the-art performance, on classification tasks for 3D object recognition

strength, the most f electrons behave as renormalized paramagnetic states in
the Kondo or mixed-valence regime, but a small number of f moments remain

allowed to have an integrable singular point. The resulting estimates provide
optimal decay rates which show explicitly the influence of these two particular
points. Then we apply these abstract results to solution formulas of a class of
dispersive equations on the line defined by Fourier multipliers. Under the
hypothesis that the Fourier transform of the initial data has a compact support
or an integrable singular point, we derive uniform estimates of the solutions
in space-time cones, describing their motions when the time tends to infinity.
The method permits also to show that symbols having a restricted growth at
infinity may influence the dispersion of the solutions: we prove the existence
of a cone, depending only on the symbol, in which the solution is
time-asymptotically localized. This corresponds to an asymptotic version of the
notion of causality for initial data without compact support.

operator subject to a fixed control pulse. Using the level sets of the
switching function we can (i) compute the set of all pulses that drive the
system toward the steady state in a synchronous way and (ii) estimate the time
needed by the flow to reach an epsilon neighborhood of the target steady state.
Additionally, we show that for monotone systems the switching function is also
monotone in some sense, a property that can yield efficient algorithms to
compute it. This observation recovers and further extends the results of the
original framework, which we illustrate on numerical examples inspired by
biological applications.

band, it has been possible to measure the central black hole mass on large AGN1
samples. However these measurements use the width of the broad line region as a
proxy of the virial velocities and are therefore difficult to be carried out on
those obscured (type 2) or low luminosity AGN where the nuclear component does
not dominate in the optical. Here we present the optical and near infrared
spectrum of the starburst/Seyfert galaxy NGC 6221, observed with X-shooter/VLT.
Previous observations of NGC 6221 in the X-ray band show an absorbed (N_H=8.5
+/- 0.4 x 10^21 cm^-2) spectrum typical of a type 2 AGN with luminosity
log(L_14-195 keV) = 42.05 erg/s, while in the optical band its spectrum is
typical of a reddened (A_V=3) starburst. Our deep X-shooter/VLT observations
have allowed us to detect faint broad emission in the H_alpha, HeI and Pa_beta
lines (FWHM ~1400-2300 km/s) confirming previous studies indicating that NGC
6221 is a reddened starburst galaxy which hosts an AGN. We use the measure of
the broad components to provide a first estimate of its central black hole mass
(M_BH = 10^(6.6 +/- 0.3) Msol, lambda_Edd=0.01-0.03), obtained using recently
calibrated virial relations suitable for moderately obscured (N_H<10^24 cm^-2)

time-averaged probability distributions of non-conserved quantities like
magnetization and correlation functions to the thermal distributions according
to the canonical Gibbs ensemble obtained with quantum Monte Carlo simulations

occurrence of thermalization crucially depends on the quench parameters: While
after the interaction quenches in the paramagnetic phase thermalization can be
observed, our results for the field quenches in the ferromagnetic phase show
clear deviations from the thermal system. These deviations increase with the
quench strength and become especially clear comparing the shape of the thermal
and the time-averaged distributions, the latter ones indicating that the system
does not completely lose the memory of its initial state even for strong
quenches. We discuss our results with respect to a recently formulated theorem

coincide with the definition of pseudo-bosons as originally given in Ref

cosmic string loops with windings in a simply connected internal space. Since
the windings cannot be topologically stabilized, stability must be achieved (if
at all) dynamically. As toy models for realistic compactifications, we consider
windings on a small section of $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is valid as an
approximation to any simply connected internal manifold if the winding radius
is sufficiently small, and windings on an $S^2$ of constant radius
$\mathcal{R}$. We then use Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory to analyze the
Jacobi stability of the string equations and determine bounds on the physical
parameters that ensure dynamical stability of the windings. We find that, for
the same initial conditions, the curvature and topology of the internal space
have nontrivial effects on the microscopic behavior of the string in the higher
dimensions, but that the macroscopic behavior is remarkably insensitive to the
details of the motion in the compact space. This suggests that
higher-dimensional signatures may be extremely difficult to detect in the
effective $(3+1)$-dimensional dynamics of strings compactified on an internal

minimizing the mean squared distance principle, based on the computationally
efficient quadratic optimization methods. However, when faced with
high-dimensional and noisy data, the quadratic error functionals demonstrated
many weaknesses including high sensitivity to contaminating factors and
dimensionality curse. Therefore, a lot of recent applications in machine
learning exploited properties of non-quadratic error functionals based on $L_1$
norm or even sub-linear potentials corresponding to quasinorms $L_p$ ($0<p<1$).
The back side of these approaches is increase in computational cost for
optimization. Till so far, no approaches have been suggested to deal with {\it
arbitrary} error functionals, in a flexible and computationally efficient
framework. In this paper, we develop a theory and basic universal data
approximation algorithms ($k$-means, principal components, principal manifolds
and graphs, regularized and sparse regression), based on piece-wise quadratic
error potentials of subquadratic growth (PQSQ potentials). We develop a new and
universal framework to minimize {\it arbitrary sub-quadratic error potentials}
using an algorithm with guaranteed fast convergence to the local or global
error minimum. The theory of PQSQ potentials is based on the notion of the cone
of minorant functions, and represents a natural approximation formalism based
on the application of min-plus algebra. The approach can be applied in most of
existing machine learning methods, including methods of data approximation and
regularized and sparse regression, leading to the improvement in the
computational cost/accuracy trade-off. We demonstrate that on synthetic and
real-life datasets PQSQ-based machine learning methods achieve orders of
magnitude faster computational performance than the corresponding
state-of-the-art methods.

the steady propagation of an air finger through a collapsed oil-filled channel
with a single compliant wall. In a previous study using fully-compliant elastic
tubes, a `pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low
pressure, which may enable rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with
minimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel 2008). In this paper, we identify the
selection mechanism of that pointed finger, which remained unexplained, by
conducting an experimental study in a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with
an elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid
channel is broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube the
channel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to
the point of first near wall contact. The simplification of the vessel geometry
enables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of
initial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single
centred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the
tip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section
develops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape
evolves smoothly towards a `flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the
strong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode
of reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its
propagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at
high collapse, while vessel compliance stabilises it. A simple scaling argument
based on the dissipated power reveals that this reopening mode is preferred at
higher propagation speeds when it becomes favourable to displace the elastic
channel wall rather than the viscous fluid.

miscible two-fluid flow down an incline are examined. The fluids have the
matched density but different viscosity. A smooth viscosity stratification is
achieved due to the presence of a thin mixed layer between the fluids. The
results show that the presence of slip exhibits a promise for stabilizing the
miscible flow system by raising the critical Reynolds number at the onset and
decreasing the bandwidth of unstable wave numbers beyond the threshold of the
dominant instability. This is different from its role in the case of a single
fluid down a slippery substrate where slip destabilizes the flow system at the
onset. Though the stability properties are analogous to the same flow system
down a rigid substrate, slip is shown to delay the surface mode instability for
any viscosity contrast. It has a damping/promoting effect on the overlap modes
(which exist due to the overlap of critical layer of dominant disturbance with
the mixed layer) when the mixed layer is away/close from/to the slippery
inclined wall. The trend of slip effect is influenced by the location of the
mixed layer, the location of more viscous fluid and the mass diffusivity of the
two fluids. The stabilizing characteristics of slip can be favourably used to
suppress the non-linear breakdown which may happen due to the coexistence of
the unstable modes in a flow over a substrate with no slip. The results of the
present study suggest that it is desirable to design a slippery surface with
appropriate slip sensitivity in order to meet a particular need for a specific
application.

means for regularising the optimisation problem and prevents the appearance of

paper, we study the transceiver design for a point-to-point multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system with CE precoding. Both single-stream
transmission (i.e., beamforming) and multi-stream transmission (i.e., spatial
multiplexing) are considered. For single-stream transmission, we optimize the
receive beamforming vector to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) for any
given channel realization and desired constellation at the combiner output. By
reformulating the problem as an equivalent quadratically constrained quadratic
program (QCQP), we propose an efficient semi-definite relaxation (SDR) based
algorithm to find an approximate solution. Next, for multi-stream transmission,
we propose a new scheme based on antenna grouping at the transmitter and
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) or zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming at the
receiver. The transmit antenna grouping and receive beamforming vectors are
then jointly designed to minimize the maximum SER over all data streams.
Finally, the error-rate performance of single- versus multi-stream transmission
is compared via simulations under different setups.

the Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME) on
the lander employed piezoelectric detectors to detect the submillimetre- and
millimetre-sized dust and ice particles emitted from the nucleus. We determine
the upper limit of the ambient flux of particles in the measurement range of
DIM based on the measurements performed with the instrument during Philae's
descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia at distances of about 22 km, 18 km,
and 5 km from the nucleus barycentre and at the final landing site Abydos. The
geometric factor of the DIM sensor is calculated assuming an isotropic ambient
flux of the submillimetre- and millimetre-sized particles. For the measurement
intervals when no particles were detected the maximum true impact rate was
calculated by assuming Poisson distribution of the impacts, and it was given as
the detection limit at a 95% confidence level. Based on measurements performed
with DIM, the upper limit of the flux of particles in the measurement range of
the instrument was of the order of $10^{-8}-10^{-7}m^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}$ during
descent and $1.6\cdot10^{-9}m^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}$ at Abydos on 13 and 14 Nov
2014. Considering particle speeds below escape velocity, the upper limit for
the volume density of particles in the measurement range of DIM was constrained
to $10^{-11}m^{-3}-10^{-12}m^{-3}$. Results of the calculations performed with
the GIPSI tool on the expected particle fluxes during the descent of Philae
were compatible with the non-detection of compact particles by the DIM
instrument.

the aid of ab initio methods based on the density functional theory. An
unexpected phenomenon of structural transformation at the atomic level above a
certain value of the strain was revealed in cumulene chain (carbyne-{\beta}).
This phenomenon is a consequence of stability loss of the old equilibrium
atomic positions that occur at small strain, and appearance of two new stable
equilibrium positions near each of them. The aforementioned restructuring gives
rise to a softening of {\pi}-mode whose frequency tends to zero in a certain
region of amplitudes when carbon atoms begin to vibrate near new equilibrium
positions. This resembles the concept of soft mode whose ""freezing"" is
postulated in the theory of phase transitions in crystals to explain the
transitions of displacement type. The dynamical modeling of mass point chains
whose particles interact via Lennard-Jones potential can approximate our ab
initio results well enough. In particular, this study demonstrates an essential
role of dipole-dipole interactions between carbon atoms in formation of their
new equilibrium positions in the cumulene chain. We believe that computer
studying of Lennard-Jones chains enables to predict properties of various
dynamical objects in carbon chains (different nonlinear normal modes and their
bushes, discrete breathers etc.) which then can be verified by ab initio

These models, as for instance Verhulst, Gompertz and Bertalanffy models, are
posted in such a manner that all the parameters involved have physical
interpretation. A model based on the interaction (distance dependent) between
the individuals (microscopic level) is also presented. This microscopic model
reachs the phenomenological models presented as particular cases. In this
approach, the Verhulst model represents the situation in which all the

That means Verhulst model is a kind of mean field model. The other
phenomenological models are reaching from the microscopic model according to
two quantities: i) the relation between the way that the interaction decays
with the distance; and ii) the dimension of the spatial structure formed by the
population. This microscopic model allows understanding population growth by
first principles, because it predicts that some phenomenological models can be
seen as a consequence of the same individual level kind of interaction. In this
sense, the microscopic model that will be discussed here paves the way to
finding universal patterns that are common to all types of growth, even in

the stationary ground state of the system as well as to coherent collisions
between two or more solitons. Using coupled Gaussian trial wave functions, we
demonstrate that the variational approach is a powerful method to calculate the
soliton dynamics. This method has the advantage that it is computationally
faster compared to numerically exact grid calculations. In addition, it goes
far beyond the capability of analytical ground state solutions, because the
variational approach provides the ability to treat excited solitons as well as
dynamical interactions between different wave packets. To demonstrate the power
of the variational approach, we calculate the stationary ground state of the
soliton and compare it with the analytical solution showing the convergence to
the exact solution. Furthermore, we extend our calculations to nonstationary
solitons by investigating the breathing oscillations of excited solitons and
the coherent collisions of several wave packets in both the low- and
high-energy regime. Comparisons of the variational approach with numerically
exact simulations on grids reveal excellent agreement in the high-energy regime
while deviations can be observed for low energies.

extremely weak polarization signals in Fraunhofer spectral lines. Photon noise,
straylight, and the systematically different sensitivity of the Zeeman effect
to longitudinal and transversal magnetic fields result in controversial results
in terms of the strength and angular distribution of the magnetic field vector.
  Aims. The information content of Stokes measurements close to the diffraction
limit of the 1.5 m GREGOR telescope is analyzed. We took the effects of spatial
straylight and photon noise into account.
  Methods. Highly sensitive full Stokes measurements of a quiet-Sun region at
disk center in the deep photospheric Fe I lines in the 1.56 {\mu}m region were
obtained with the infrared spectropolarimeter GRIS at the GREGOR telescope.
Noise statistics and Stokes V asymmetries were analyzed and compared to a
similar data set of the Hinode spectropolarimeter (SOT/SP). Simple diagnostics
based directly on the shape and strength of the profiles were applied to the
GRIS data. We made use of the magnetic line ratio technique, which was tested
against MHD simulations.
  Results. About 80% of the GRIS spectra of a very quiet solar region show
polarimetric signals above a 3{\sigma} level. Area and amplitude asymmetries
agree well with small-scale surface dynamo MHD simulations. The magnetic line
ratio analysis reveals ubiquitous magnetic regions in the ten to hundred Gauss
range with some concentrations of kilo-Gauss fields.
  Conclusions. The GRIS spectropolarimetric data at a spatial resolution of
0.40"" are so far unique in the combination of high spatial resolution scans and
high magnetic field sensitivity. Nevertheless, the unavoidable effect of
spatial straylight and the resulting dilution of the weak Stokes profiles means
that inversion techniques still bear a high risk of misinterpretating the data.

that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises,
global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and
last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability

influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a
crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to,
and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been
developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the
identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and
the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion

from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional

models employing both peer interaction and external information, and
emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in

respectively 30kpc and 41kpc in projection from their disks. The galaxies'
gaseous disks are truncated and the kinematics of the stellar and gas
components are decoupled, supporting the RPS scenario. The emission of the
ionized gas extends in the direction of a possible companion for both galaxies
suggesting a TI. The overall gas velocity field of SOS-61086 is reproduced by
ad hoc N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of RPS acting almost face-on and
starting about 250Myr ago, consistent with the age of the young stellar
populations. A link between the observed gas stripping and the cluster-cluster
interaction experienced by SC-1329-313 and A3562 is suggested. Simulations of
ram pressure acting almost edge-on are able to fully reproduce the gas velocity
field of SOS-90630, but cannot at the same time reproduce the extended tail of

we study, by means of two dimensional numerical simulations, the linear phase
and the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability within the
framework of relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics, as appropriate in
situations where the Alfven velocity approaches the speed of light. It is found
that the linear phase of the instability closely matches the analysis in
classical MHD, where the growth rate scales with the Lundquist number S as
S^-1/2, with the only exception of an enhanced inertial term due to the thermal
and magnetic energy contributions. In addition, when thin current sheets of
inverse aspect ratio scaling as S^-1/3 are considered, the so-called ""ideal""
tearing regime is retrieved, with modes growing independently on S and
extremely fast, on only a few light crossing times of the sheet length. The
overall growth of fluctuations is seen to solely depend on the value of the
background Alfven velocity. In the fully nonlinear stage we observe an inverse
cascade towards the fundamental mode, with Petschek-type supersonic jets

However, little is known concerning their performance in energy and
environmental areas. Zeolite RHO shows unique pore deformations upon changes in
hydration, cation siting, cation type, or temperature-pressure conditions. By
varying the level of distortion of double eight-rings, it is possible to
control the adsorption properties, which confer a molecular valve behavior to
this material. We have employed interatomic potentials-based simulations to
obtain a detailed atomistic view of the structural distortion mechanisms of
zeolite RHO, in contrast with the averaged and space group restricted
information provided by diffraction studies. We have modeled four
aluminosilicate structures, containing Li$^+$, Na$^+$, K$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$, and
Sr$^{2+}$ cations. The distortions of the three different zeolite rings are
coupled, and the six- and eight-membered rings are largely flexible. A large
dependence on the polarizing power of the extra-framework cations and with the
loading of water has been found for the minimum aperture of the eight-membered
rings that control the nanovalve effect. The calculated energy barriers for
moving the cations across the eight-membered rings are very high, which
explains the experimentally observed slow kinetics of the phase transition as
well as the appearance of metastable phases.

could collide with the solar atmosphere to emit Hard X-rays (HXRs) via
non-thermal bremsstrahlung, while some of these electrons would move upwards
and escape into the interplanetary medium, to form a superhalo electron
population measured in the solar wind. After considering the electron energy
loss due to Coulomb collisions and the ambipolar electrostatic potential, we
find that the sources of the superhalo could only occur high in the corona (at
a heliocentric altitude $\gtrsim 1.9$ R$_\odot$ (the mean radius of the Sun)),
to remain a power-law shape of electron spectrum as observed by STEREO at 1AU
near solar minimum (Wang et al., 2012). The modeled quiet-Sun HXRs related to
the superhalo electrons fit well to a power-law spectrum, $f \sim
\varepsilon^{-\gamma}$, with an index $\gamma$ $\approx$ 2.0 - 2.3 (3.3 - 3.7)
at 10 - 100 keV, for the warm/cold thick-target (thin-target) emissions
produced by the downward-traveling (upward-traveling) accelerated electrons.
These simulated quiet-Sun spectra are significantly harder than the observed
spectra of most solar HXR flares. Assuming that the quiet-Sun sources cover 5%
of the solar surface, the modeled thin-target HXRs are more than six orders of
magnitude weaker than the RHESSI upper limit for quiet-Sun HXRs (Hannah et al.,
2010). Using the thick-target model for the downward-traveling electrons, the
RHESSI upper limit restricts the number of downward-traveling electrons to at
most $\approx$3 times the number of escaping electrons. This ratio is
fundamentally different from what is observed during solar flares associated
with escaping electrons where the fraction of downward-traveling electrons
dominates by a factor of 100 to 1000 over the escaping population.

meteoroid streams. Previous works have studied the effects of two-body
resonances in different comets and streams. These already established two-body
resonances were mainly induced either by Jovian or Saturnian effects but not
both at the same time. Some of these resonances have led to spectacular meteor
outbursts and storms in the past. In this work, we find a new resonance
mechanism involving three bodies -- i.e. meteoroid particle, Jupiter and
Saturn, in the Perseid meteoroid stream. Long-term three-body resonances are
not very common in real small bodies in our solar system although they can
mathematically exist at many resonant sweet spots in an abstract sense in any
dynamical system. This particular resonance combination in the Perseid stream
is such that it is close to the ratio of 1:4:10 if the orbital periods of
Perseid particle, Saturn and Jupiter are considered respectively. These
resonant Perseid meteoroids stay resonant for typically about 2 kyr. Highly
compact dust trails due to this unique resonance phenomenon are present in our
simulations. Some past and future years are presented where three-body resonant
meteoroids of different sizes (or subject to different radiation pressures) are
computed to come near the Earth. This is the first theoretical example of an
active and stable three-body resonance mechanism in the realm of meteoroid
streams.

reconnection. A similar mechanism for energising particles has also been found
to operate in the Earth's magnetotail. One particular feature proposed to be of
importance for particle acceleration in the magnetotail is that of a braking
plasma jet, i.e. a localised region of strong flow encountering stronger
magnetic field which causes the jet to slow down and stop. Such a feature has
not been included in previously proposed analytical models of CMTs for solar
flares. In this work we incorporate a braking plasma jet into a well studied
CMT model for the first time. We present results of test particle calculations

behaviour caused by the magnetic structure of the jet braking region, which
allows electrons to be trapped both in the braking jet region and the loop

in the semiclassical energy at the field where the classical ground state is
the collinear up-up-down structure, and that this kink gives rise to a locally
linear behavior of the energy with the field when all semiclassical ground

for the inflaton, and that neither instant preheating nor gravitational
particle production would avoid this problem due to the persistence of the

the pow er spectrum reveals the presence of QPOs, detected only in the second
part of the observation, with a strong peak at a frequency of
1.46$\pm{0.07}$~mHz, together with higher harm onics. The X-ray spectrum is
highly absorbed (N$_{\rm H}$=$10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$), well fitted by a power-law

1.46 mHz QPO in the framework of both disc-fed and wind-fed HMXBs, favouring
the quasi-spherical accretion scenario. The low flux observed by XMM-Newton
leads to about three orders of magnit ude the source dynamic range, overlapping
with the one observed from Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). However,

set. The boundary of low dimensional projections of this convex set may exhibit
nontrivial geometry such as ruled surfaces. In this paper, we study the
physical origins of these ruled surfaces for bosonic systems. The emergence of
ruled surfaces was recently proposed as signatures of symmetry-breaking phase.
We show that, apart from being signatures of symmetry-breaking, ruled surfaces
can also be the consequence of gapless quantum systems by demonstrating an
explicit example in terms of a two-mode Ising model. Our analysis was largely
simplified by the quantum de Finetti's theorem---in the limit of large system
size, these RDMs are the convex set of all the symmetric separable states. To
distinguish ruled surfaces originated from gapless systems from those caused by
symmetry-breaking, we propose to use the finite size scaling method for the
corresponding geometry. This method is then applied to the two-mode XY model,
successfully identifying a ruled surface as the consequence of gapless systems.

observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex
task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference
procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood

indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to
adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally
demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data
that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here
to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a
function, parametrized by a neural network that maps empirical covariance
matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two
benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to
form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge
structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this
framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic
data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real

first-principles quantum mechanical methods. We consider 29 distinct hexagonal

to account for proton-disorder. We find quantum zero-point vibrational
corrections to the minimum electronic band gaps ranging from -1.5 to -1.7 eV,
which leads to improved agreement between calculated and experimental band
gaps. Anharmonic nuclear vibrations play a negligible role in determining the
gaps. Deuterated ice has a smaller band-gap correction at zero-temperature of
-1.2 to -1.4eV. Vibrations reduce the differences between the electronic band
gaps of different proton-orderings from around 0.17 eV to less than 0.05 eV, so
that the electronic band gaps of hexagonal and cubic ice are almost independent
of the proton-ordering when quantum nuclear vibrations are taken into account.
The comparatively small reduction in the band gap over the temperature range
0-240 K of around 0.1 eV does not depend on the proton ordering, or whether the
ice is protiated or deuterated, or hexagonal or cubic. We explain this in terms
of the atomistic origin of the strong electron-phonon coupling in ice.

formulation of the model leads to an indefinite weight linear eigenvalueproblem
in a fixed box $\Omega$ and we consider the general case of Robin boundary

{\it bang-bang} weights taking two values of different signs, that can be
parametrized by the characteristic function of the subset $E$ of $\Omega$ on
which resources are located. Therefore, the optimal spatial arrangement is
obtained by minimizing the positive principal eigenvalue with respect to $E$,
under a volume constraint. By using symmetrization techniques, as well as
necessary optimality conditions, we prove new qualitative results on the

counter-intuitive result that the ball is almost never a solution in dimension
2 or higher, despite what suggest the numerical simulations. We also introduce

framework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic of
a custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network
parameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area
for multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the
need for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The
tool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Since
training of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly
optimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any
given network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully
condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.

region in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. After mapping the kinematics in
H{\alpha} with Fabry-Perot spectroscopy we used slit spectra to measure the
intensities of the [SII] doublet at {\lambda}{\lambda} 671.9, 673.1 nm and the
[NII] doublet at {\lambda}{\lambda} 645.8, 658.3 nm to corroborate the
kinematics and apply diagnostic tests using line ratios. These showed that the
expanding shells are shock dominated as would be the case if they had
originated with supernova explosions. Estimating their kinetic energies we find
fairly low values, indicating a fairly advanced stage of evolution. We obtain
density, mass and parent star mass estimates, which, along with the kinetic
energies, are inconsistent with the simplest models of shock-interstellar
medium interaction. We propose that the presence and properties of an
inhomogeneous medium offer a scenario which can account for these observations,
and discuss the implications. Comparing our results with data from the

a strong case for the adoption of mobile-edge caching, as we are able to reap

data-analysis project is demonstrated through an analysis of the radio pulsar
B1839-04. This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where
the drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse
profile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.
Various tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of
periodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and
polarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the
radio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the
fluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly
demonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a
completely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be
determined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint
on the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission
modes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being
present only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation
cycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for
the bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that
the variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking
implies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.
Phase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically
proposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown
to be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating
beamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,
possibly by distortions in the magnetic field.

  Algorithms","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) may improve current
clinical DBS treatment for neurological movement disorders, but control
algorithms may perform differently across patients. New metrics are needed for
comparing and evaluating closed-loop algorithm performance that address the
specific needs of closed-loop neuromodulation controllers. Approach: A metric
is proposed for system performance that includes normalized terms that can be
used to compare algorithm performance for a patient. This metric was evaluated
using two closed-loop control algorithms that were tested in patients with
Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience rest tremor. Main Results: The metric's
resulting balance between tremor treatment and power savings varied on a per
patient and algorithm basis. This was expected given how each trial resulted in
a variable reduction in stimulation power at the cost of additional tremor for
the patient when compared to open-loop stimulation. Significance: The proposed
metric will aid in clinical evaluation of new algorithms and provide a
benchmark for future system designers. This will be important given the growing
potential applications of dynamically adjusted neural stimulation.

system in which symptoms (e.g., insomnia and fatigue) are directly connected to
one another in a network structure. We hypothesize that individuals can be
characterized by their own network with unique architecture and resulting
dynamics. With respect to architecture, we show that individuals vulnerable to
developing MD are those with strong connections between symptoms: e.g., only
one night of poor sleep suffices to make a particular person feel tired. Such
vulnerable networks, when pushed by forces external to the system such as
stress, are more likely to end up in a depressed state; whereas networks with
weaker connections tend to remain in or return to a healthy state. We show this
with a simulation in which we model the probability of a symptom becoming
active as a logistic function of the activity of its neighboring symptoms.
Additionally, we show that this model potentially explains some well-known
empirical phenomena such as spontaneous recovery as well as accommodates
existing theories about the various subtypes of MD. To our knowledge, we offer
the first intra-individual, symptom-based, process model with the potential to
explain the pathogenesis and maintenance of major depression.

  Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity","14 pages",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.022",,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) model in the first
order formalism. We show that all the solutions of the Einstein gravity with
negative cosmological constants solve the equations of motion of considered
model. Then we find an expression for the off-shell conserved charges of this
model. By considering the near horizon geometry of a three dimensional black
hole in the Gaussian null coordinates, we find near horizon conserved charges
and their algebra. The obtained algebra is centrally extended. By writing the
algebra of conserved charges in terms of Fourier modes and considering the BTZ
black hole solution as an example, one can see that the charge associated with
rotations along $\mathcal{Y}_{0}$ coincides exactly with the angular momentum,
and he charge associated with time translations $\mathcal{T}_{0}$ is the
product of the black hole entropy and its temperature. As we expect, in the
limit when the GMMG tends to the Einstein gravity, all the result we obtain in
this paper reduce to the result of the paper \cite{5}.
