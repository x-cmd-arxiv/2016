powerful platforms with unprecedented optical functionalities. Conventional
nanofabrication technologies, however, do not permit viable integration of
complex photonic devices onto optical fibers owing to their low throughput and
high cost. In this paper we report the fabrication of a three dimensional
structure achieved by direct Nanoimprint Lithography on the facet of an optical
fiber. Nanoimprint processes and tools were specifically developed to enable a
high lithographic accuracy and coaxial alignment of the optical device with
respect to the fiber core. To demonstrate the capability of this new approach,
a 3D beam splitter has been designed, imprinted and optically characterized.
Scanning electron microscopy and optical measurements confirmed the excellent
lithographic capabilities of the proposed approach as well as the desired
optical performance of the imprinted structure. The inexpensive solution
presented here should enable advancements in areas such as integrated optics
and sensing, achieving enhanced portability and versatility of fiber optic
components.

recognition. However combining them in a principal way is nontrivial, as they
are generally abstracted by different structures (closed string vs graph),
respectively. This paper aims at addressing the shape recognition problem by
combining contour and skeleton according to the correspondence between them.
The correspondence provides a straightforward way to associate skeletal
information with a shape contour. More specifically, we propose a new shape
descriptor. named Skeleton-associated Shape Context (SSC), which captures the
features of a contour fragment associated with skeletal information. Benefited
from the association, the proposed shape descriptor provides the complementary
geometric information from both contour and skeleton parts, including the
spatial distribution and the thickness change along the shape part. To form a
meaningful shape feature vector for an overall shape, the Bag of Features
framework is applied to the SSC descriptors extracted from it. Finally, the
shape feature vector is fed into a linear SVM classifier to recognize the
shape. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate that the proposed way
to combine contour and skeleton is effective for shape recognition, which
achieves the state-of-the-art performances on several standard shape
benchmarks.

learning and statistics that are used for inference, sampling, and modeling.
With the growth of large-scale datasets, the computational cost associated with
simulating these stochastic processes can be considerable, and many algorithms
have been proposed to approximate the underlying Markov chain or diffusion. A
fundamental question is how the computational savings trade off against the
statistical error incurred due to approximations. This paper develops general
results that address this question. We bound the Wasserstein distance between
the equilibrium distributions of two diffusions as a function of their mixing
rates and the deviation in their drifts. We show that this error bound is tight
in simple Gaussian settings. Our general result on continuous diffusions can be
discretized to provide insights into the computational-statistical trade-off of
Markov chains. As an illustration, we apply our framework to derive
finite-sample error bounds of approximate unadjusted Langevin dynamics. We
characterize computation-constrained settings where, by using fast-to-compute
approximate gradients in the Langevin dynamics, we obtain more accurate samples
compared to using the exact gradients. Finally, as an additional application of
our approach, we quantify the accuracy of approximate zig-zag sampling. Our
theoretical analyses are supported by simulation experiments.

anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault
propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. In this
regard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex fault
propagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paper
presents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressing
such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction
scheme for distributed cyber-physical systems built on the concept of symbolic
dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems
of a complex system. We present two approaches for root-cause analysis, namely
the sequential state switching ($S^3$, based on free energy concept of a
Restricted Boltzmann Machine, RBM) and artificial anomaly association ($A^3$, a
multi-class classification framework using deep neural networks, DNN).
Synthetic data from cases with failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are
simulated to validate the proposed approaches, then compared with the
performance of vector autoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis.
Real dataset based on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) is also used for
validation. The results show that: (1) $S^3$ and $A^3$ approaches can obtain
high accuracy in root-cause analysis and successfully handle multiple nominal
operation modes, and (2) the proposed tool-chain is shown to be scalable while
maintaining high accuracy.

because of the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and prior

computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large
datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has
focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a
random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is
often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a
coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this
small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without
modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction
algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for
fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative
models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of
the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional
effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic
and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is
independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset
takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.

reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do
not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are
shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during
training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of
the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are
only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that
seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the
vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient

The results are presented in the form of charged-particle nuclear modification
factors, where the $p+$Pb charged-particle multiplicities are compared between
central and peripheral $p+$Pb collisions as well as to charged-particle cross
sections measured in pp collisions. The $p+$Pb collision centrality is
characterized by the total transverse energy measured in $-4.9<\eta<-3.1$,
which is in the direction of the outgoing lead beam. Three different
estimations of the number of nucleons participating in the $p+$Pb collision are
carried out using the Glauber model and two Glauber-Gribov colour-fluctuation
extensions to the Glauber model. The values of the nuclear modification factors
are found to vary significantly as a function of rapidity and transverse
momentum. A broad peak is observed for all centralities and rapidities in the
nuclear modification factors for charged-particle transverse momentum values
around $3$ GeV. The magnitude of the peak increases for more central collisions
as well as rapidity ranges closer to the direction of the outgoing lead
nucleus.

geometry processing, arising in a wide variety of applications. The problem is
especially difficult in the setting of non-isometric deformations, as well as
in the presence of topological noise and missing parts, mainly due to the
limited capability to model such deformations axiomatically. Several recent
works showed that invariance to complex shape transformations can be learned
from examples. In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic convolutional neural
network architecture based on anisotropic diffusion kernels, which we term
Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN). In our construction, we
generalize convolutions to non-Euclidean domains by constructing a set of
oriented anisotropic diffusion kernels, creating in this way a local intrinsic
polar representation of the data (`patch'), which is then correlated with a
filter. Several cascades of such filters, linear, and non-linear operators are
stacked to form a deep neural network whose parameters are learned by
minimizing a task-specific cost. We use ACNNs to effectively learn intrinsic
dense correspondences between deformable shapes in very challenging settings,
achieving state-of-the-art results on some of the most difficult recent
correspondence benchmarks.

inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an
instance of a spectrum commons where heterogeneous technologies and deployments
must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could
coexist only in a primary-secondary DSA mode, a spectrum commons offers
competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi
and the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper we
systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for
inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we propose a general framework for comparative analysis of
spectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of
key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and
interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating different
distributed MAC sharing mechanisms at the same level of abstraction. Finally,
we present a case study of IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed
band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum
commons. Our extensive simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in
the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such
that time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the
general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC sharing mechanisms
strongly depends on the interference coupling in the network, as determined by
building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference
coupling, e.g. residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms
outperform sensing-based LBT mechanisms; and (ii) high interference coupling,
e.g. open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty
cycle mechanisms.

demanding task in which a large number of connection weights are iteratively

computational performance. Here we study the difficult case of networks with
discrete weights, where the optimization landscape is very rough even for
simple architectures, and provide theoretical and numerical evidence of the
existence of rare - but extremely dense and accessible - regions of
configurations in the network weight space. We define a novel measure, which we
call the ""robust ensemble"" (RE), which suppresses trapping by isolated
configurations and amplifies the role of these dense regions. We analytically
compute the RE in some exactly solvable models, and also provide a general
algorithmic scheme which is straightforward to implement: define a
cost-function given by a sum of a finite number of replicas of the original
cost-function, with a constraint centering the replicas around a driving
assignment. To illustrate this, we derive several powerful new algorithms,
ranging from Markov Chains to message passing to gradient descent processes,
where the algorithms target the robust dense states, resulting in substantial
improvements in performance. The weak dependence on the number of precision
bits of the weights leads us to conjecture that very similar reasoning applies
to more conventional neural networks. Analogous algorithmic schemes can also be
applied to other optimization problems.

function that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from a
front-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or a
reference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy
function is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and
ground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known to
suffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states
reachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advanced
algorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by
iteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained
policies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to a
reference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often
expensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called
SafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous
driving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show
that it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe a
significant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to the
effect of automated curriculum learning.

parameterizations. These represent two distinct areas: Subgrid processes that
the model cannot resolve, and diabatic sources in the equations, due to
radiation for example. Hence, coupling between these physics parameterizations
and the resolved fluid dynamics and also between the dynamics of the air and

illustrate the problems. Nevertheless the same applies to other geophysical
models. This coupling is an important aspect of geophysical models. However,
often model development is strictly segregated into either physics or dynamics.

in the design of dynamical cores, extended process physics and predicted future
changes of the computational infrastructure are increasing complexity. This

the phenomenology of the coupling problem with references to examples in the

how to advance the understanding and upcoming challenges with emerging modeling
strategies. This paper is of interest to model developers who aim to improve

volatility-- has played a key role in forecasting and understanding volatility

improve forecasts, empirical evidence paradoxically do not show that most
individual stocks exhibit this phenomena, mischaracterizing risk and therefore
leading to poor predictive performance. We examine this paradox, with the goal
to improve density forecasts, by relaxing the assumption of linearity in the
leverage effect. Nonlinear generalizations of the leverage effect are proposed
within the Bayesian stochastic volatility framework in order to capture
flexible leverage structures, where small fluctuations in prices have a
different effect from large shocks. Efficient Bayesian sequential computation
is developed and implemented to estimate this effect in a practical, on-line
manner. Examining 615 stocks that comprise the S\&P500 and Nikkei 225, we find
that relaxing the linear assumption to our proposed nonlinear leverage effect
function improves predictive performances for 89\% of all stocks compared to

multiple different granularities at various resources. We observe that such
multi-granularity management results in significant inefficiency in the memory
subsystem. Specifically, we observe that 1) page-granularity virtual memory
unnecessarily triggers large memory operations, and 2) existing cache-line
granularity memory interface is inefficient for performing bulk data operations
and operations that exhibit poor spatial locality. To address these problems,
we present a series of techniques in this thesis.
  First, we propose page overlays, a framework augments the existing virtual
memory framework with the ability to track a new version of a subset of cache
lines within each virtual page. We show that this extension is powerful by
demonstrating its benefits on a number of applications.
  Second, we show that DRAM can be used to perform more complex operations than
just store data. We propose RowClone, a mechanism to perform bulk data copy and
initialization completely inside DRAM, and Buddy RAM, a mechanism to perform
bulk bitwise operations using DRAM. Both these techniques achieve an
order-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the respective operations.
  Third, we propose Gather-Scatter DRAM, a technique that exploits DRAM
organization to effectively gather/scatter values with a power-of-2 strided
access patterns. For these access patterns, GS-DRAM achieves near-ideal
bandwidth and cache utilization, without increasing the latency of fetching
data from memory.
  Finally, we propose the Dirty-Block Index, a new way of tracking dirty
blocks. In addition to improving the efficiency of bulk data coherence, DBI has
several applications including high-performance memory scheduling, efficient
cache lookup bypassing, and enabling heterogeneous ECC.

graphs, e.g., unoriented trees has been the simple randomized algorithm
discovered the 80s. This algorithm (commonly called Luby's algorithm) computes
an MIS in $O(\log n)$ rounds (with high probability). This situation changed
when Lenzen and Wattenhofer (PODC 2011) presented a randomized $O(\sqrt{\log
n}\cdot \log\log n)$-round MIS algorithm for unoriented trees. This algorithm
was improved by Barenboim et al. (FOCS 2012), resulting in an $O(\sqrt{\log n
\cdot \log\log n})$-round MIS algorithm.
  The analyses of these tree MIS algorithms depends on ""near independence"" of
probabilistic events, a feature of the tree structure of the network. In their
paper, Lenzen and Wattenhofer hope that their algorithm and analysis could be
extended to graphs with bounded arboricity. We show how to do this. By using a
new tail inequality for read-k families of random variables due to Gavinsky et
al. (Random Struct Algorithms, 2015), we show how to deal with dependencies
induced by the recent tree MIS algorithms when they are executed on bounded
arboricity graphs. Specifically, we analyze a version of the tree MIS algorithm
of Barenboim et al. and show that it runs in $O(\mbox{poly}(\alpha) \cdot
\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log\log n})$ rounds in the $\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model for
graphs with arboricity $\alpha$.
  While the main thrust of this paper is the new probabilistic analysis via
read-$k$ inequalities, for small values of $\alpha$, this algorithm is faster
than the bounded arboricity MIS algorithm of Barenboim et al. We also note that
recently (SODA 2016), Gaffari presented a novel MIS algorithm for general
graphs that runs in $O(\log \Delta) + 2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$ rounds; a
corollary of this algorithm is an $O(\log \alpha + \sqrt{\log n})$-round MIS
algorithm on arboricity-$\alpha$ graphs.

Two species of motors that are directed oppositely (e.g. kinesin, dynein) can
be attached to the same cargo, which is known to produce bidirectional net
motion. Although previous work focuses on the motor number as the driving noise
source for switching, we propose an alternative mechanism: cargo diffusion. A
mean-field mathematical model of mechanical interactions of two populations of
molecular motors with cargo thermal fluctuations (diffusion) is presented to
study this phenomenon. The delayed response of a motor to fluctuations in the
cargo velocity is quantified, allowing for the reduction of the full model a
single ""characteristic distance"", a proxy for the net force on the cargo. The
system is then found to be metastable, with switching exclusively due to cargo
diffusion between distinct directional transport states. The time to switch
between these states is then investigated using a mean first passage time
analysis. The switching time is found to be non-monotonic in the drag of the
cargo, providing an experimental test of the theory.

the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal (NEATM) model which correctly accounts for the
presence of reflected sunlight in short wave IR bands. Kirchhoff's law of
thermal radiation applies to this case and has important implications. New
insight is provided into the eta parameter in the NEATM model and it is
extended to thermal models besides NEATM. The role of surface material
properties on eta is examined using laboratory spectra of meteorites and other
asteroid compositional proxies; the common assumption that emissivity e = 0.9
in asteroid thermal models may not be justified and can lead to misestimating
physical parameters. In addition, indeterminacy in thermal modeling can limit
its ability to uniquely determine temperature and other physical properties. A
new curve fitting approach allows thermal modeling to be done independent of
visible band observational parameters such as the absolute magnitude H. These
new thermal modeling techniques are applied to observational data for selected
asteroids from the WISE/NEOWISE mission. The previous NEOWISE analysis assumes
Kirchhoff's law does not apply. It also deviates strongly from established
statistical practice and systematically underestimates the sampling error
inherent in observing potentially irregular asteroids from a finite sample of
observations. As a result, the new analysis finds asteroid diameter and other
physical properties that have large differences from published NEOWISE results,
with greatly increased error estimates. NEOWISE results have a claimed +/-10%
accuracy for diameter estimates, but this is unsupported. ABSTRACT CONTINUED IN

where the game played at each interaction is drawn uniformly at random from a
set of two different games. While in well-mixed populations the random mixture
of the two games is always equivalent to the average single game, in structured
populations this is not always the case. We show that the outcome is in fact
strongly dependent on the distance of separation of the two games in the
parameter space. Effectively, this distance introduces payoff heterogeneity,
and the average game is returned only if the heterogeneity is small. For higher
levels of heterogeneity the distance to the average game grows, which often
involves the promotion of cooperation. The presented results support preceding
research that highlights the favorable role of heterogeneity regardless of its

running-time overhead per iteration, and worst case convergence rate that
depends unfavorably on the dimension.
  In this work we present a new conditional gradient variant and a
corresponding analysis that improves on both of the above shortcomings. In
particular: both memory and computation overheads are only linear in the
dimension. Moreover, in case the optimal solution is sparse, the new
convergence rate replaces a factor which is at least linear in the dimension in
previous works, with a linear dependence on the number of non-zeros in the
optimal solution.
  At the heart of our method, and corresponding analysis, is a novel way to
compute decomposition-invariant away-steps. While our theoretical guarantees do
not apply to any polytope, they apply to several important structured polytopes
that capture central concepts such as paths in graphs, perfect matchings in
bipartite graphs, marginal distributions that arise in structured prediction
tasks, and more. Our theoretical findings are complemented by empirical
evidence which shows that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance.

H${\beta}$, Fe5015 and Mgb. Based on single stellar population (SSP) models, we
calculate ages, metallicities and [Mg/Fe] abundances and their gradients along
the bar major and minor axes. The high spatial resolution of our data allows us
to identify breaks among index and SSP profiles, commonly at 0.13$\pm$0.06 bar
length, consistent with kinematic features. Inner gradients are about ten times
steeper than outer gradients and become larger when there is a central rotating
component, implying that the gradients are not independent of dynamics and
orbits. Central ages appear to be younger for stronger bars. Yet, the bar
regions are usually old. We find a flattening of the iron (Fe5015) and
magnesium (Mgb) outer gradients along the bar major axis, translating into a
flattening of the metallicity gradient. This gradient is found to be
0.03$\pm$0.07 dex/kpc along the bar major axis while the mean value of the bar
minor axis compares well with that of an unbarred control sample and is
significantly steeper, namely -0.20$\pm$0.04 dex/kpc. These results confirm
recent simulations and discern the important localized influence of bars. The
elevated [Mg/Fe] abundances of bars and bulges compared to the lower values of

relics as $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ early-type galaxies with

hot intracluster medium prevents cold gas from reaching the galaxies,
inhibiting star formation.

Here, we present the first empirical prediction of $f_{esc}$ at z>6 by
combining the (sparsely populated) relation between [OIII]/[OII] and $f_{esc}$
with the redshift evolution of [OIII]/[OII] as predicted from local high-z

there is a negative correlation with stellar mass and we find up to 50% larger

fraction increases according to $f_{esc}$ = $f_{esc,0} ((1+z)/3)^a$, with

For a fixed total mass range, the free parameters of the Einasto fits are
closely correlated. Galaxies which had more (dry) merger events tend to have
lesser curved outer stellar halos, however, we find no indication that the

Majorana Dark Matter (DM). Because the interaction with the Standard Model (SM)
particles is spin-dependent, a priori the constraints that one gets from
neutrino telescopes, the LHC, direct and indirect detection experiments are
comparable. We study the complementarity of these searches in a particular
example, in which a heavy $Z'$ mediates the interactions between the SM and the
DM. We find that for heavy dark matter indirect detection provides the
strongest bounds on this scenario, while IceCube bounds are typically stronger
than those from direct detection. The LHC constraints are dominant for smaller
dark matter masses. These light masses are less motivated by thermal relic
abundance considerations. We show that the dominant annihilation channels of
the light DM in the Sun and the Galactic Center are either $b\bar b$ or $t\bar
t$, while the heavy DM annihilation is completely dominated by $Zh$ channel.
The latter produces a hard neutrino spectrum which has not been previously
analyzed. We study the neutrino spectrum yielded by DM and recast IceCube
constraints to allow proper comparison with constraints from direct and
indirect detection experiments and LHC exclusions. Note that the original
version of the paper contains an important error: the contribution of the
$Z$-mediated processes was overlooked. This changes some of the results of the
paper. For the details and the correct results please see the erratum attached

which the charm parton distribution function (PDF) is parametrized on the same
footing as the light quarks and the gluon in a global PDF analysis. This
determination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions
in the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated
contributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is
assumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light
quarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find
that the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV
for all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient
functions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and
low scales does not vanish, but rather has an ""intrinsic"" component, very
weakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying
about 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other
PDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the
dependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm
structure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and
PDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we
verify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our
findings. The increased stability with respect to m_c persists at high scales
and is the main implication of our results for LHC phenomenology. Fitting the
charm PDF modifies the predictions for processes such as high p_T and large
rapidity charm pair production and Z+c production, and thus we expect that
future LHC data will further constrain the charm content of the proton.

of these estimates depends on our understanding of CO freezeout and desorption
from dust grains. Most models of these processes indicate that CO column
density decreases monotonically with distance from the central star due to a
decrease in gas density and freezeout beyond the CO snowline. We present ALMA
Cycle 2 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O $J=2-1$ emission
that instead suggest CO enhancement in the outer disk of T Tauri star AS 209.
Most notably, the C$^{18}$O emission consists of a central peak and a ring at a
radius of $\sim1''$ (120 AU), well outside the expected CO snowline. We propose
that the ring arises from the onset of CO desorption near the edge of the
millimeter dust disk. CO desorption exterior to a CO snowline may occur via
non-thermal processes involving cosmic rays or high-energy photons, or via a
radial thermal inversion arising from dust migration.

an unambiguous and first simultaneous detection of both the Lyman-alpha
emission and the Lyman break from a z = 7.512+/- 0.004 galaxy, observed in the
Faint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS). These spectra, taken with G102 grism on
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), show a significant emission line detection (6
sigma) in multiple observational position angles (PA), with total integrated
Ly{\alpha} line flux of 1.06+/- 0.12 e10-17erg s-1cm-2. The line flux is nearly
a factor of four higher than the previous MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of
faint Ly{\alpha} emission at {\lambda} = 1.0347{\mu}m, yielding z = 7.5078+/-
0.0004. This is consistent with other recent observations implying that
ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy underestimates total emission line
fluxes, and if confirmed, can have strong implications for reionization studies
that are based on ground-based Lyman-{\alpha} measurements. A 4-{\sigma}
detection of the NV line in one PA also suggests a weak Active Galactic Nucleus
(AGN), potentially making this source the highest-redshift AGN yet found. Thus,
this observation from the Hubble Space Telescope clearly demonstrates the
sensitivity of the FIGS survey, and the capability of grism spectroscopy to
study the epoch of reionization.

solute particles with short-range, isotropic interactions that can bond
multiple times is of fundamental interest in understanding liquids and
colloidal mixtures. Because of multi-body correlations predicting the structure
and thermodynamics of such systems remains a challenge. Earlier Marshall and
Chapman developed a theory wherein association effects due to interactions
multiply the partition function for clustering of particles in a reference
hard-sphere system. The multi-body effects are incorporated in the clustering
process, which in their work was obtained in the absence of the bulk medium.
The bulk solvent effects were then modeled approximately within a second order
perturbation approach. However, their approach is inadequate at high densities
and for large association strengths. Based on the idea that the clustering of
solvent in a defined coordination volume around the solute is related to
occupancy statistics in that defined coordination volume, we develop an
approach to incorporate the complete information about hard-sphere clustering
in a bulk solvent at the density of interest. The occupancy probabilities are
obtained from enhanced sampling simulations but we also develop a concise
parametric form to model these probabilities using the quasichemical theory of
solutions. We show that incorporating the complete reference information
results in an approach that can predict the bonding state and thermodynamics of
the colloidal solute for a wide range of system conditions.

finite-dimensional algebras with matrices of structural constants satisfying an
analogue of Kolmogorov-Chapman equation. These flows of algebras (FA) can also
be considered as deformations of algebras with the rule (the evolution

multiplications of cubic matrices which were introduced by Maksimov and
consider Kolmogorov-Chapman equation with respect to these multiplications. If
all cubic matrices of structural constants are stochastic (there are several
kinds of stochasticity) then the corresponding FA is called stochastic FA
(SFA). We define SFA generated by known quadratic stochastic processes. For
some multiplications of cubic matrices we reduce Kolmogorov-Chapman equation
given for cubic matrices to the equation given for square matrices. Using this
result many FAs are given (time homogenous, time non-homogenous, periodic,

The structure of
a biological population affects which traits evolve. Understanding evolutionary
game dynamics in structured populations is difficult. Precise results have been
absent for a long time, but have recently emerged for special structures where
all individuals have the same number of neighbors. But the problem of
determining which trait is favored by selection in the natural case where the
number of neighbors can vary, has remained open. For arbitrary selection
intensity, the problem is in a computational complexity class which suggests
there is no efficient algorithm. Whether there exists a simple solution for
weak selection was unanswered. Here we provide, surprisingly, a general formula
for weak selection that applies to any graph or social network. Our method uses
coalescent theory and relies on calculating the meeting times of random walks.
We can now evaluate large numbers of diverse and heterogeneous population
structures for their propensity to favor cooperation. We can also study how
small changes in population structure---graph surgery---affect evolutionary
outcomes. We find that cooperation flourishes most in societies that are based
on strong pairwise ties.

probabilistic inference to interpret its environment. Here we present a new
general-purpose, biologically-plausible neural implementation of approximate
inference. The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic
Population Codes (PPCs), which are distributed neural representations that
naturally encode probability distributions, and support marginalization and
evidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple
PPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model, we represent multivariate
probability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be
accomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information
throughout the graph. An attractive and often accurate example of such an
algorithm is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which uses local marginalization
and evidence integration operations to perform approximate inference
efficiently even for complex models. Unfortunately, a subtle feature of LBP
renders it neurally implausible. However, LBP can be elegantly reformulated as
a sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model. We
re-express the TRP updates as a nonlinear dynamical system with both fast and
slow timescales, and show that this produces a neurally plausible solution. By
combining all of these ideas, we show that a network of PPCs can represent
multivariate probability distributions and implement the TRP updates to perform
probabilistic inference. Simulations with Gaussian graphical models demonstrate
that the neural network inference quality is comparable to the direct
evaluation of LBP and robust to noise, and thus provides a promising mechanism
for general probabilistic inference in the population codes of the brain.

order to unravel this conundrum, high throughput density functional theory

Au$_{13}$, and Au$_{14}$ nanoclusters are evaluated. With any DFT functional,
globular and planar structures coexist across the size range of interest. The
planar-globular transition is gradual at room temperature rather than a sharp
transition as previously believed. The effects of anionicity, $\textit{s-d}$
band hybridization and long range interactions on the dimensional transition
are quantified by using the structures adjacent to minima. Anionicity
marginally changes the relative stability of the clusters. The degree of
$\textit{s-d}$ hybridization is varied via changing the Hubbard U value which
corroborate that $\textit{s-d}$ hybridization alone does not stabilize planar
structures. van der Waals interactions, on the other hand, stabilize globular
structures. These results elucidate the balance between the different reasons

atomic-scale thickness remains unclear, and even counterintuitive when their

nanoclusters nucleate within molecular templates and then fuse. Here, we test
this mechanism for zincblende nanoplatelets and show that they form instead due
to an intrinsic instability in growth kinetics. We synthesize CdSe and
CdS1-xSex nanoplatelets in template- and solvent-free isotropic melts

charged, non-rotating $n$-dimensional BTZ black hole in AdS space. This is done
by first deriving the conserved mass of a ""spherically"" symmetric domain wall,
which is then taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the domain wall.
  In the classical picture, we show that, as far as the asymptotic observer is
concerned, the details of the collapse depend on the amount of charge present
in the domain wall. In the both the extremal and non-extremal cases, the
collapse takes an infinite amount of observer time to complete. However, in the
over-charged case, the collapse never actually occurs, instead one finds an
oscillatory solution which prevents the formation of a naked singularity. As
far as the infalling observer is concerned, the collapse is completed within a
finite amount of proper time. Thus, the gravitational collapse follows that of
the typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse.
  Quantum mechanically, in the absence of induced quasi-particle production and
fluctuations of the metric geometry, we take primary interest in the behavior
of the collapse near the horizon and near the classical singularity from the
point of view of both asymptotic and infalling observers. For the asymptotic
observer, we find that quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions. For the infalling observer, the most interesting quantum
mechanical effect are when the collapsing shell approaches the classical
singularity. Here, we find, that the quantum effects in this region display
non-local effects, which depend on the energy density of the domain wall.

ignore or assume away such variation. In the context of randomized experiments,
this paper proposes a framework for decomposing overall treatment effect
variation into a systematic component explained by observed covariates and a
remaining idiosyncratic component. Our framework is fully randomization-based,
with estimates of treatment effect variation that are entirely justified by the
randomization itself. Our framework can also account for noncompliance, which
is an important practical complication. We make several contributions. First,
we show that randomization-based estimates of systematic variation are very
similar in form to estimates from fully-interacted linear regression and two
stage least squares. Second, we use these estimators to develop an omnibus test
for systematic treatment effect variation, both with and without noncompliance.
Third, we propose an $R^2$-like measure of treatment effect variation explained
by covariates and, when applicable, noncompliance. Finally, we assess these
methods via simulation studies and apply them to the Head Start Impact Study, a

  Let $f(n)$ be the smallest integer $k$ such that there is a coloring of $\{1,

observables caused by this scenario, we here present the first detailed
emplacement simulation in the presence of a massive ninth planet on the distant
Kuiper Belt. We perform 4 Gyr N-body simulations with the currently known Solar
System planetary architecture, plus a 10 Earth mass planet with similar orbital
parameters to those suggested by Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) or Batygin & Brown

including a distant superearth-mass planet produces a substantially different
orbital distribution for the scattering and detached TNOs, raising the
pericenters and inclinations of moderate semimajor axis (50<a<500 AU) objects.
We test whether this signature is detectable via a simulator with the
observational characteristics of four precisely characterized TNO surveys. We
find that the qualitatively very distinct Solar System models that include a
ninth planet are essentially observationally indistinguishable from an outer
Solar System produced solely by the four giant planets. We also find that the
mass of the Kuiper Belt's current scattering and detached populations is
required to be 3-10 times larger in the presence of an additional planet. We do
not find any evidence for clustering of orbital angles in our simulated TNO
population. Wide-field, deep surveys targeting inclined high-pericenter objects

demonstrate that the preferential model is better for illustrating the

applicable not only to autosomes but also to the X chromosome, although the X
chromosome has different characteristics from autosomes. The analysis of the

accelerator-driven Compton gamma-ray source, providing high flux gamma-ray beam

operates three accelerators, a linac pre-injector (0.16 GeV), a booster
injector (0.16-1.2 GeV), and an electron storage ring (0.24-1.2 GeV). Because
of proximity of the booster injector to the storage ring, the magnetic field of
the booster dipoles close to the ring can significantly alter the closed orbit
in the storage ring being operated in the low energy region. This type of orbit
distortion can be a problem for certain precision experiments which demand a
high degree of the energy consistency of the gamma-ray beam. This energy
consistency can be achieved by maintaining consistent aiming of the gamma-ray
beam, therefore, a steady electron beam orbit and angle at the Compton
collision point. To overcome the booster leakage field problem, we have
developed an orbit compensation scheme. This scheme is developed using two fast
orbit correctors and implemented as a feedforward which is operated
transparently together with the slow orbit feedback system. In this paper, we
will describe the development of this leakage field compensation scheme, and
report the measurement results which have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
scheme.

Further decreasing the sum amplitude, however, causes a decrease in SNR.
Therefore, the highest SNR in ambient conditions is achieved when the sum

observed in FDs following 45 interplanetary shocks (IP-shocks), each associated
with an identified eruption on the sun, we infer the average spatial
distribution of GCRs behind IP-shocks. We find two distinct modulations of GCR
density in FDs, one in the magnetic sheath and the other in the coronal mass
ejection (CME) behind the sheath. The density modulation in the sheath is
dominant in the western flank of the shock, while the modulation in the CME
ejecta stands out in the eastern flank. This east-west asymmetry is more
prominent in GMDN data responding to $\sim$ 60 GV GCRs than in NM data
responding to $\sim$ 10 GV GCRs, because of softer rigidity spectrum of the
modulation in the CME ejecta than in the sheath. The GSE-y component of the
density gradient, $G_y$ shows a negative (positive) enhancement in FDs caused
by the eastern (western) eruptions, while $G_z$ shows a negative (positive)
enhancement in FDs by the northern (southern) eruptions. This implies the GCR
density minimum being located behind the central flank of IP-shock and
propagating radially outward from location of the solar eruption. We also
confirmed the average $G_z$ changing its sign above and below the heliospheric
current sheet, in accord with the prediction of the drift model for the
large-scale GCR transport in the heliosphere.

achieve near-optimal dependence on the number of interactions and reflect the

giving insights on the problem complexity. To the best of our knowledge, these
are the first such results. Our experiments show that in several representative
graph topologies, the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper
bounds. IMLinUCB permits linear generalization and thus is both statistically
and computationally suitable for large-scale problems. Our experiments also
show that IMLinUCB with linear generalization can lead to low regret in

environmental conditions in which the data is captured, e.g., lighting
conditions and target density. Tuning of parameters or choosing a completely
new algorithm is often needed to achieve a certain performance level,
especially when there is a limitation of the computation source. In this paper,
we focus on this problem and propose a framework to adaptively select the
""best"" algorithm-parameter combination and the computation platform under
performance and cost constraints at design time, and adapt the algorithms at
runtime based on real-time inputs. This necessitates developing a mechanism to
switch between different algorithms as the nature of the input video changes.
Our proposed algorithm calculates a similarity function between a test video
scenario and each training scenario, where the similarity calculation is based
on learning a manifold of image features that is shared by both the training
and test datasets. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates the
same algorithm can be applied to both of them and achieve similar performance.
We design a cost function with this similarity measure to find the most similar
training scenario to the test data. The ""best"" algorithm under a given platform
is obtained by selecting the algorithm with a specific parameter combination
that performs the best on the corresponding training data. The proposed
framework can be used first offline to choose the platform based on performance
and cost constraints, and then online whereby the ""best"" algorithm is selected
for each new incoming video segment for a given platform. In the experiments,
we apply our algorithm to the problems of pedestrian detection and tracking. We
show how to adaptively select platforms and algorithm-parameter combinations.
Our results provide optimal performance on 3 publicly available datasets.

the detections range between 0.2 x 10^6 and 1.1 x 10^6 \msun, for conservative

detections are not coincident with the HI cloud, but instead are in the region

therefore be the result of very efficient cooling of the down-stream gas photo-

with narrower profiles, which are closer to or inside the HI cloud, could be
pre-existing cold H_2 cores which manage to survive the effects of the passing

diffusive superconductors. By employing the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's
function technique in the quasiclassical approximation, we derive coupled
transport equations for the spectral spin and particle distributions and for
the energy density in the elastic scattering regime. We compute four
contributions to the spin Hall conductivity, namely, skew scattering,
side-jump, anomalous velocity, and the Yafet contribution. The reduced density
of states in the superconductor causes a renormalization of the spin Hall
angle. We demonstrate that all four of these contributions to the spin Hall
conductivity are renormalized in the same way in the superconducting state. In
its simplest manifestation, spin swapping transforms a primary spin current
into a secondary spin current with swapped current and polarization directions.
We find that the spin-swapping coefficient is not explicitly but only
implicitly affected by superconducting correlations through the renormalized
diffusion coefficients. We discuss experimental consequences for measurements
of the (inverse) spin Hall effect and spin swapping in four-terminal
geometries. In our geometry, below the superconducting transition temperature,
the spin-swapping signal is increased an order of magnitude while changes in
the (inverse) spin Hall signal are moderate.

to instabilities leading to macroscale vortical structures. The linear and
nonlinear fate of such a macroscale flow in a strongly coupled medium is a
fundamental problem. A popular example of a strongly coupled medium is a dusty
plasma, often modelled as a Yukawa liquid. Recently, laboratory experiments and
MD studies of shear flows in strongly coupled Yukawa liquids, indicated
occurrence of strong molecular shear heating, which is found to reduce the
coupling strength exponentially leading to destruction of macroscale vorticity.
To understand the vortex dynamics of strongly coupled molecular fluids
undergoing macroscale shear flows and molecular shear heating, MD simulation
has been performed, which allows the macroscopic vortex dynamics to evolve
while at the same time, ""removes"" the microscopically generated heat without
using the velocity degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that by using a
configurational thermostat in a novel way, the microscale heat generated by
shear flow can be thermostatted out efficiently without compromising the large
scale vortex dynamics. In present work, using MD simulations, a comparative
study of shear flow evolution in Yukawa liquids in presence and absence of
molecular or microscopic heating is presented for a prototype shear flow

function that is the composite of the average of multiple empirical losses and
a regularization term. Unlike the traditional asynchronous proximal stochastic

the master to workers, and leaves the master to conduct simple addition
operations. This strategy yields an easy-to-parallelize algorithm, whose
performance is justified by theoretical convergence analyses. To be specific,
DAP-SGD achieves an $O(\log T/T)$ rate when the step-size is diminishing and an
ergodic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate when the step-size is constant, where $T$ is the
number of total iterations.

of relative intensity between the leading and trailing components is the
predominant feature of mode switching. The intensity ratio between the leading
and trailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over
30 seconds. It is found that there is an excess of high ratios over the normal
distribution, which indicates that two modes exist in the pulsar. The
distribution of abnormal mode has a narrower width indicating that the abnormal
mode is more stable than the normal mode. A total of 76 mode switching events
are detected in our data. It spends 89\% in the normal mode and 11\% in the
abnormal mode. The intrinsic distributions of mode timescales are constrained
with power-law distributions. The significant difference in the index of the
duration distribution between normal and abnormal modes possibly indicates that
the timescale for the abnormal mode to get stable is shorter than that for the
normal mode. The frequent switching between both modes may indicate that the
oscillations between different magnetospheric states are rapid.

magnetohydrodynamics. In particular, they are the kind of stationary solutions

structures (vortex tubes and vortex lines) of arbitrarily complicated topology.
On the contrary, there are very few results about the existence of generalized
Beltrami fields, that is, divergence-free fields whose curl is the field itself
times a non-constant function. In fact, generalized Beltrami fields (which are
also stationary solutions to the Euler equations) have been recently shown to
be rare, in the sense that for ""most"" proportionality factors there are no
nontrivial Beltrami fields of high enough regularity (e.g., of class
$C^{6,\alpha}$), not even locally.
  We show that, nevertheless, there are ""many"" Beltrami fields with
non-constant factor, even realizing arbitrarily complicated vortex structures.
The core results are an ""almost global"" stability theorem for strong Beltrami
fields, which ensures that a global strong Beltrami field with suitable decay
at infinity can be perturbed to get ""many"" Beltrami fields with non-constant
factor of arbitrarily high regularity and defined in the exterior of an
arbitrarily small ball, and a ""local"" stability theorem for generalized
Beltrami fields, which is an analogous perturbative result that is valid for
any kind of Beltrami field (not just with a constant factor) but only applies
to small enough domains.
  The proof relies on an iterative scheme of Grad-Rubin type. For this purpose,
we study the Neumann problem for the inhomogeneous Beltrami equation in
exterior domains via a boundary integral equation method and we obtain H\""older
estimates, a sharp decay at infinity and some compactness properties for these
sequences of approximate solutions.

absorption of cylindrically polarized femtosecond laser irradiation of silver
(Ag) in sub-ablation conditions. A theoretical prediction of the role of
surface plasmon excitation in the production of self-formed periodic ripples
structures is evaluated. Furthermore, a combined hydrodynamical and
thermoelastic model is presented to account for the influence of
temperature-related lattice movements in laser beam conditions that are
sufficient to produce material melting. The ability to control the size of the
morphological changes via modulating the beam polarization aims to provide a
systematic methodology for controlling and optimizing the outcome of laser
micro-processing.

the Casimir effect is systematically investigated in the $d$-dimensional
configuration space from the point of thermodynamic consideration. We show
that, for $d=3$, the shift of density arises completely due to the Casimir
effect and, the MFP remains totally ineffective regardless of the state,
condensate or non-condensate. But for dimension $d>3$ the MFP plays an active
role in shifting the density of Bose gas along with the Casimir interaction.
The sign of density shift becomes positive in the present case. So, the
corresponding critical temperature shift would be negative, because these two
shifts are related as $\Delta n_{c}$/$n_{c}$ $\approx$ -$\Delta T_{c}$/$T_{c}$.
It is important to note that, the MFP causes a shift of density for $d>3$ even
when the Casimir effect is not there, and the sign of shift becomes negative
then; consequently, the critical temperature shift would be positive with MFP
alone in this particular situation.

obtained by clustering documents in multiple ways. Specifically, we model
document collections using a class of graphical models called hierarchical
latent tree models (HLTMs). The variables at the bottom level of an HLTM are
observed binary variables that represent the presence/absence of words in a
document. The variables at other levels are binary latent variables, with those
at the lowest latent level representing word co-occurrence patterns and those
at higher levels representing co-occurrence of patterns at the level below.
Each latent variable gives a soft partition of the documents, and document
clusters in the partitions are interpreted as topics. Latent variables at high
levels of the hierarchy capture long-range word co-occurrence patterns and
hence give thematically more general topics, while those at low levels of the
hierarchy capture short-range word co-occurrence patterns and give thematically
more specific topics. Unlike LDA-based topic models, HLTMs do not refer to a
document generation process and use word variables instead of token variables.
They use a tree structure to model the relationships between topics and words,
which is conducive to the discovery of meaningful topics and topic hierarchies.

Gambler's Ruin Bandit Problem (GRBP). In the GRBP, the learner proceeds in a
sequence of rounds, where each round is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with
two actions (arms): a continuation action that moves the learner randomly over
the state space around the current state; and a terminal action that moves the
learner directly into one of the two terminal states (goal and dead-end state).
The current round ends when a terminal state is reached, and the learner incurs
a positive reward only when the goal state is reached. The objective of the
learner is to maximize its long-term reward (expected number of times the goal
state is reached), without having any prior knowledge on the state transition
probabilities. We first prove a result on the form of the optimal policy for
the GRBP. Then, we define the regret of the learner with respect to an
omnipotent oracle, which acts optimally in each round, and prove that it
increases logarithmically over rounds. We also identify a condition under which

meta-learning approach where performance may be improved by post-processing.
This improvement is done by establishing a dynamic threshold on the

the method presented can be used on any state of the art classifier in order to

cost, enable cooperative communications, and increase system flexibility
through centralized baseband processing. By pooling multiple virtual base
stations (VBSs) and consolidating their stochastic computational tasks, the
overall computational resource can be reduced, achieving the so-called
statistical multiplexing gain. In this paper, we evaluate the statistical
multiplexing gain of VBS pools using a multi-dimensional Markov model, which
captures the session-level dynamics and the constraints imposed by both radio
and computational resources. Based on this model, we derive a recursive formula
for the blocking probability and also a closed-form approximation for it in
large pools. These formulas are then used to derive the session-level
statistical multiplexing gain of both real-time and delay-tolerant traffic.
Numerical results show that VBS pools can achieve more than 75% of the maximum
pooling gain with 50 VBSs, but further convergence to the upper bound
(large-pool limit) is slow because of the quickly diminishing marginal pooling
gain, which is inversely proportional to a factor between the one-half and
three-fourth power of the pool size. We also find that the pooling gain is more
evident under light traffic load and stringent Quality of Service (QoS)
requirement.

It has been previously detected only in the J band and two mid-IR bands. To
better measure its spectral energy distribution (SED), we have performed deep
imaging of WISE 0855-0714 in six optical and near-IR bands with Gemini
Observatory, the Very Large Telescope, and the Hubble Space Telescope. Five of
the bands show detections, although one detection is marginal (S/N~3). We also
have obtained two epochs of images with the Spitzer Space Telescope for use in
refining the parallax of the brown dwarf. By combining astrometry from this
work and previous studies, we have derived a parallax of 0.449+/-0.008""
(2.23+/-0.04 pc). We have compared our photometry for WISE 0855-0714 to data
for known Y dwarfs and to the predictions of three suites of models by Saumon
et al. (2012) and Morley et al. (2012, 2014) that are defined by the presence
or absence of clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry. Our estimates of Y-J and
J-H for WISE 0855-0714 are redder than colors of other Y dwarfs, confirming a
predicted reversal of near-IR colors to redder values at temperatures below
300-400 K. In color-magnitude diagrams, no single suite of models provides a
clearly superior match to the sequence formed by WISE 0855-0714 and other Y
dwarfs. Instead, the best fitting model changes from one diagram to the next.
Similarly, all of the models have substantial differences from the SED of WISE
0855-0714. As a result, we are currently unable to constrain the presence of
clouds or non-equilibrium chemistry in its atmosphere.

simulated with the AGN feedback are in much better agreement with the REXCESS
L_X-T relation, they are also more substructured, which increases the tension
with observations. This suggests that not only global cluster properties such

simulations with observations, but also substructure measures such as centre
shifts and power ratios. We discuss what changes in the simulations might ease
the tension with observational constraints on these quantities.

scales. A common manifestation of spatial scales is the presence of (at least)
two different scales of pores, which is commonly referred to as double
porosity. To complicate things, the pore-network at each scale exhibits
different permeability, and these networks are connected through fissure and
conduits. Although some models are available in the literature, they lack a
strong theoretical basis. This paper aims to fill this lacuna by providing the
much needed theoretical foundations of the flow in porous media which exhibit
double porosity/permeability. We first obtain a mathematical model for double
porosity/permeability using the maximization of rate of dissipation hypothesis,
and thereby providing a firm thermodynamic underpinning. We then present, along
with mathematical proofs, several important mathematical properties that the
solutions to the double porosity/permeability model satisfy. These properties
are important in their own right as well as serve as good (mechanics-based) a
posteriori measures to assess the accuracy of numerical solutions. We also
present several canonical problems and obtain the corresponding analytical
solutions, which are used to gain insights into the velocity and pressure
profiles, and the mass transfer across the two pore-networks. In particular, we
highlight how the solutions under the double porosity/permeability differ from
the corresponding solutions under Darcy equations.

that couple to electron spin can induce magnetic fields in the interior of
