modeled in terms of non-linear velocity dependent force. In general, this force
may consist of both even and odd functions of velocity. We derive the
expression for total entropy production in such systems using the Fokker-Planck
equation. The result is consistent with the expression for stochastic entropy
production in the reservoir, that we obtain from probabilities of time-forward
and time-reversed trajectories, leading to fluctuation theorems. Numerical
simulation is used to find probability distribution of entropy production,
which shows good agreement with the detailed fluctuation theorem.

report an identification of the radio source VLA J213002.08+120904 (aka M15
S2), recently reported in Kirsten et al. 2014, as a BHXB candidate. They showed
that the parallax of this flat-spectrum variable radio source indicates a
2.2$^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ kpc distance, which identifies it as lying in the
foreground of the globular cluster M15. We determine the radio characteristics
of this source, and place a deep limit on the X-ray luminosity of
$\sim4\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we astrometrically identify a
faint red stellar counterpart in archival Hubble images, with colors consistent
with a foreground star; at 2.2 kpc its inferred mass is 0.1-0.2 $M_{\odot}$. We
rule out that this object is a pulsar, neutron star X-ray binary, cataclysmic

$2.6\times10^4-1.7\times10^8$ BHXBs at $3\sigma$ confidence, than has been
previously estimated ($\sim10^2-10^4$) through population synthesis.

purely extrinsic to the cavity by showing no extra dissipation (unchanged Q0)
after quenching in zero magnetic field, which allows us to rule out intrinsic
mechanisms of flux trapping such as generation of thermal currents or trapping
of the rf field. We also show the clear relation of dissipation introduced by
quenching to the orientation of the applied magnetic field and the possibility
to fully recover the quality factor by requenching in the compensated field. We
discover that for larger values of the ambient field, the Q-factor degradation
may become irreversible by this technique, likely due to the outward flux
migration beyond the normal zone opening during quench. Our findings are of
special practical importance for accelerators based on low- and medium-beta
accelerating structures residing close to focusing magnets, as well as for all
high-Q cavity-based accelerators.

with doubling timescale of 2.5 hours was detected in another $\gamma$-ray flare
in May 2010, for which the 3-hour $\gamma$-ray peak flux is $\sim 250$ times of
the average flux in 7 years. Rather similar behaviors are observed in blazars
and the blazar model can reasonably reproduce the spectral energy distribution
of III Zw 2 in a wide energy range, strongly suggesting that its central engine
resembles that of blazars. In view of its core which shares radio similarities
with young radio sources together with the weak extended radio lobe emission,
we suggest that III Zw 2 harbors a recurrent activity core and serves as a
valuable target for investigating the fuelling and triggering of the activity

probability spaces $(\mathcal A_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathcal
A_K,\phi_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\phi_K)$, when is $\mathbf D$ $*$-free? (See
Section 1.2 for a precise formulation of this problem.)
  Settling whether or not freeness occurs in tensor products is a recurring
problem in operator algebras, and the following two examples provide a natural
motivation for the above question:
  (A) If $(a_{1;i}:i\in I)$ is a $*$-free family of Haar unitary variables and
$a_{k,i}$ are arbitrary unitary variables for $k\geq2$, then the $*$-freeness
persists at the level of the tensor product $\mathbf D$.
  (B) A converse of (A) holds true if all variables $a_{k;i}$ are group-like
elements (see Corollary 1.7 of Proposition 1.6).
  It is therefore natural to seek to understand the extent to which such simple
characterizations hold true in more general cases. While our results fall short
of a complete characterization, we make notable steps toward identifying
necessary and sufficient conditions for the freeness of $\mathbf D$. For
example, we show that under evident assumptions, if more than one family
$(a_{k,i}:i\in I)$ contains non-unitary variables, then the tensor family fails
to be $*$-free (see Theorem 1.8 (1)).

gap is supported by the fact that $\beta (R)$ is enhanced at the 22~au gap,

histories were complex and can be divided into different epochs and scenarios.
In particular, during 75 percent of the SFH, the galaxies behaved as closed
boxes and, during the remaining 25 percent, either received a lot of primordial
gas by accretion or they lost metals through metal-rich winds. In order to
discriminate between these two scenarios, abundances ratios in old stars are
needed. At t approximately 4.5 Gyr, the galaxies lost most of their gas due to
a short-strong, well-mixed wind. We obtain very similar CEMs for both galaxies,

the point nodes in the bulk spectrum of topological Dirac semimetals have a
vanishing Chern number, but can yet be stable due to the existence of
crystalline symmetries such as uniaxial (discrete) rotation symmetry. We
consider a model low-energy Hamiltonian appropriate for the recently discovered
topological Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$, and calculate the Nernst response
within semiclassical Boltzmann dynamics in the relaxation time approximation.
We show that, for small chemical potentials near the Dirac points, the low
temperature, low magnetic field, Nernst response is dominated by
\textit{anomalous} Nernst effect, arising from a non-trivial profile of Berry
curvature on the Fermi surface. Although the Nernst coefficient (both anomalous
as well as conventional) vanish in the limit of zero magnetic field, the low
temperature, low magnetic field, Nernst response, which has an almost step like
profile near $\mathbf{B}=0$, serves as an effective experimental probe of
anomalous Nernst effect in topological Dirac semimetals protected by
crystalline symmetries. Additionally, we also calculate the Nernst response for
a lattice model of an inversion asymmetric Weyl semimetal for which, in
contrast to the case of Dirac semimetal, we find that the conventional Nernst
response dominates over the anomalous. Our calculations in this paper on Nernst

a representative decision process model through exploration of the

requires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the

Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could learn how to
optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied to the inverse
problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a whole-body

binaries might have small but nonnegligible orbital eccentricities when they
enter the low-frequency bands of ground and space-based gravitational-wave
detectors. If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a
potentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an
inspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the
quasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for
the gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The
quasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the
post-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries
with any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to
binaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to
the gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions
of frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known
formulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed
to 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN
approximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause
significant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep
through a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,
including a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of
periodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated
into some of the PN approximants. While the eccentric extension of the PN
approximants is our main objective, this work collects a variety of results
that may be of interest to others modeling eccentric relativistic binaries.

(QWs) exhibit very rich spin-related properties. But the full descriptions of
them are beyond the simple parabolic band models and conventional Rashba and
Dresselhaus SOI terms, as a result of the strong interband coupling of the
narrow gap band structures. Here, we develop a theoretical method to calculate
the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in
Hg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te/HgTe/Hg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te quantum wells (HgTe QWs)
based on the realistic eight-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with
density matrix formalism. Our method could take account of the unusual band
structures and SOIs of HgTe QWs, therefore can be used to calculate the CPGE
currents in HgTe QWs with non-parabolic, Dirac-like and inverted energy
dispersions. The microscopic origin of CPGE and the interplay effect of
structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) and bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) is also
investigated. In addition, this method is extended to study the pure spin
currents (PSCs) in HgTe QWs injected by linearly polarized light at normal
incidence. Our calculation results support the following findings: (i) In the
inverted phase regime, the energy dispersion of heavily inverted HgTe QWs could
be strongly distorted, lead to a significant enhancement of CPGE at a certain
range of energy spectrum. (ii) The interplay of SIA and BIA could lead to the
CPGE currents anisotropically dependent on the azimuth angle of oblique
incident light. (iii) The PSC $j_{y'}^{x'}$ ($x'\parallel[110]$ and
$y'\parallel[\bar{1}10]$) produced by [110]-linearly-polarized light could
change sign with HgTe QW transformed from normal phase to inverted phase. These
findings might be utilized in developing the HgTe-based infrared/terahertz
optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

nearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most

information about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging
relationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically
construct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First
Link Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link
Network for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people,
objects, and events are related and organized.
  By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path
lengths, groups of path-connected articles, and cycles. We also develop a new
method, traversal funnels, to measure the influence each article exerts in
shaping the network. Traversal funnels provides a new measure of influence for
directed networks without spill-over into cycles, in contrast to traditional
network centrality measures. Within Wikipedia's First Link Network, we find
scale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far
from dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few
articles---flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental
notions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths
than any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a
gravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These
findings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever

$\ell,L$ are the two parameters of smooth strong convexity. Furthermore, it is
known that this is the best possible complexity in the function-gradient oracle
model of computation. The method of linear conjugate gradients (CG) also
satisfies the same complexity bound in the special case of strongly convex
quadratic functions, but in this special case it is faster than the accelerated
gradient method.
  Despite similarities in the algorithms and their asymptotic convergence
rates, the conventional analyses of the two methods are nearly disjoint. The
purpose of this note is provide a single quantity that decreases on every step
at the correct rate for both algorithms. Our unified bound is based on a
potential similar to the potential in Nesterov's original analysis.
  As a side benefit of this analysis, we provide a direct proof that conjugate
gradient converges in $O(\sqrt{L/\ell}\log(1/\eps))$ iterations. In contrast,
the traditional indirect proof first establishes this result for the Chebyshev

rapidly growing number of practical applications. Despite their popularity and
widespread use, there are still many aspects of training and classification
that are not well understood. In this paper we aim to provide some new insights
into training and classification by analyzing neural networks from a
feature-space perspective. We review and explain the formation of decision
regions and study some of their combinatorial aspects. We place a particular
emphasis on the connections between the neural network weight and bias terms
and properties of decision boundaries and other regions that exhibit varying
levels of classification confidence. We show how the error backpropagates in
these regions and emphasize the important role they have in the formation of
gradients. These findings expose the connections between scaling of the weight
parameters and the density of the training samples. This sheds more light on
the vanishing gradient problem, explains the need for regularization, and
suggests an approach for subsampling training data to improve performance.

observations and they are related to magnetic field concentrations. Although
there is a large number of works studying them, some questions about their
nature as their magnetic properties at different heights are still open. Thus,
we aim to improve the understanding of solar polar faculae. In that sense, we
infer the vertical stratification of the temperature, gas pressure, line of
sight velocity and magnetic field vector of polar faculae regions. We performed
inversions of the Stokes profiles observed with Hinode/SP after removing the
stray light contamination produced by the spatial point spread function of the
telescope. Moreover, after solving the azimuth ambiguity, we transform the
magnetic field vector to local solar coordinates. The obtained results reveal
that the polar faculae are constituted by hot plasma with low line of sight
velocities and single polarity magnetic fields in the kilogauss range that are
nearly perpendicular to the solar surface. We also found that the spatial
location of these magnetic fields is slightly shifted respect to the continuum
observations towards the disc centre. We believe that this is due to the hot
wall effect that allows detecting photons that come from deeper layers located
closer to the solar limb.

criterion to arrive at informative conclusions. To address the first challenge,
we model the data generating process as a segment-wise autoregression, which is
composed of several segments (time epochs), each of which modeled by an
autoregressive model. We propose a multi-window method that is both effective
and efficient for discovering the structural changes. The proposed approach was
motivated by transforming a segment-wise autoregression into a multivariate
time series that is asymptotically segment-wise independent and identically
distributed. To address the second challenge, we derive theoretical guarantees
for (almost surely) selecting the true number of change points of segment-wise
independent multivariate time series. Specifically, under mild assumptions, we
show that a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)-like criterion gives a
strongly consistent selection of the optimal number of change points, while an
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-like criterion cannot. Finally, we
demonstrate the theory and strength of the proposed algorithms by experiments
on both synthetic and real-world data, including the Eastern US temperature

collapse in water. We assess the hydration thermodynamics in this collapse by
calculating the hydration free energy at each of the end points of the reaction
coordinate, here the end-to-end distance ($r$) in the chain. To examine the
role of the various conformations for a given $r$, we study the conditional
distribution, $P(R_g | r)$, of the radius of gyration for a given value of $r$.
$P(R_g|r)$ is found to vary more gently compared to the corresponding variation
in the excess hydration free energy. Using this insight within a multistate
generalization of the potential distribution theorem, we calculate a reasonable
upper bound for the hydration free energy of the peptide for a given $r$. On
this basis we find that peptide hydration greatly favors the expanded state of
the chain, despite primitive hydrophobic effects favoring chain collapse. The
net free energy of collapse is seen to be a delicate balance between opposing
intra-peptide and hydration effects, with intra-peptide contributions favoring
collapse by a small margin. The favorable intra-peptide interactions are
primarily electrostatic in origin, and found to arise primarily from
interaction between C=O dipoles, hydrogen bonding interaction between C=O and
N-H groups, and favorable interaction between N-H dipoles.

synchrony to those multiplex networks which do not exhibit synchronization for

actuator modules that are equipped with strain and pressure sensing. We show
how this data can be used to discern whether a grasp was successful.
Co-locating sensing and embedded computation with the actuators greatly
simplifies control and system integration. Equipped with a small pump, the hand
is self-contained and needs only power and data supplied by a single USB
connection to a PC. We demonstrate its function by grasping a variety of
objects ranging from very small to large and heavy objects weighing more than
the hand itself. The presented system nicely illustrates the advantages of soft
robotics: low cost, low weight, and intrinsic compliance. We exploit
morphological computation to simplify control, which allows successful grasping
via underactuation. Grasping indeed relies on morphological computation at
multiple levels, ranging from the geometry of the actuator which determines the
actuator's kinematics, embedded strain sensors to measure curvature, to
maximizing contact area and applied force during grasping. Morphological
computation reaches its limitations, however, when objects are too bulky to
self-align with the gripper or when the state of grasping is of interest. We
therefore argue that efficient and reliable grasping also requires not only
intrinsic compliance, but also embedded sensing and computation. In particular,
we show how embedded sensing can be used to detect successful grasps and vary
the force exerted onto an object based on local feedback, which is not possible
using morphological computation alone.

analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex systems.
Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore
essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM.
In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of
estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding Gaussian
distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i)
estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the
past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix
using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary
contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel
contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately
learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized
log-likelihood where the penalty is the $l_1$ norm of difference between the
foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background
precision. We modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive
estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM

structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window

from the source up to 220 keV. The $^{44}$Ti line emissions at 68 and 78 keV
are confirmed by our observations with a mean flux of $\sim (2.2\pm 0.4)\times

$(1.3\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-4}$ \ms. The continuum emission from 3 -- 500 keV can
be fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung of $kT\sim 0.79\pm 0.08$ keV plus a
power-law model of $\Gamma \sim 3.13\pm 0.03$. The non-thermal emission from
Cas A is well fitted with a power-law model without a cutoff up to 220 keV.
This radiation characteristic is inconsistent with the diffusive shock
acceleration models with the remnant shock velocity of only 5000km s$^{-1}$.
The central compact object in Cas A cannot contribute to the emission above 80
keV significantly. Some possible physical origins of the non-thermal emission
above 80 keV from the remnant shock are discussed. We deduce that the
asymmetrical supernova explosion scenario of Cas A is a promising scenario to
produce high energy synchrotron radiation photons, where a part of ejecta with
the velocity of $\sim 0.1c$ and opening angle of $\sim10^\circ$ can account for
the 100-keV emission, consistent with the ""jet"" observed in Cas A.

condition, a result which may be of independent interest. Next, we introduce a
Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a
CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the

taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to
importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to

successfully identified in the third-order macroscopic equation recovered by
the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), and then new mathematical insights into
the pseudopotential LB model are provided. For the third-order anisotropic
term, numerical tests show that it can cause the stationary droplet to become
out-of-round, which suggests the isotropic property of the LBE needs to be
seriously considered in the pseudopotential LB model. By adopting the classical
equilibrium moment or setting the so-called ""magic"" parameter to 1/12, the
anisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order
analysis and also validated numerically. As for the third-order isotropic term,
when and only when it is considered, accurate continuum form pressure tensor
can be definitely obtained, by which the predicted coexistence densities always
agree well with the numerical results. Compared with this continuum form
pressure tensor, the classical discrete form pressure tensor is accurate only
when the isotropic term is a specific one. At last, in the framework of the

and current density reveal a prominent magnetic connectivity with strong
negative $\alpha$ values and strong current density before the flare. This
magnetic connectivity extends along the main polarity inversion line and is
found to be totally broken after the flare. The distribution variation of
magnetic energy density reveals the redistribution of magnetic energy before
and after the flare. In the lower space of the modeling volume the increase of
magnetic energy dominates, and in the higher space the decrease of energy
dominates. The comparison with the flare onset imaging observation exhibits
that the breaking site of the magnetic connectivity and site with the highest
values of energy density increase coincide with the location of flare initial
eruption. We conclude that a cramped positive $\alpha$ region appearing in the
photosphere causes the breaking of the magnetic connectivity. A scenario for
flare initial eruption is proposed in which the Lorentz force acting on the

that the galaxy overdensities and the Ly$\alpha$ forest absorptions positively
correlate in space at the $\sim90\%$ confidence level. This positive

simulations, and compare with our observational results. Our simulations
reproduce the correlation, agreeing with the observational results. Moreover,
our simulations have model counterparts of $A_{obs}$-$D_{obs}$, and suggest
that the observations pinpoint, by chance, a galaxy overdensity like a
proto-cluster, gas filaments lying on the sightline, a large void, and

near-surface relative humidity to global warming: relative humidity tends to
increase slightly over oceans but decrease substantially over land. Surface
energy balance arguments have been used to understand the response over ocean
but are difficult to apply over more complex land surfaces. Here, a conceptual
box model is introduced, involving moisture transport between the land and
ocean boundary layers and evapotranspiration, to investigate the decreases in
land relative humidity as the climate warms. The box model is applied to
idealized and full-complexity (CMIP5) general circulation model simulations,
and it is found to capture many of the features of the simulated changes in
land relative humidity. The box model suggests there is a strong link between
fractional changes in specific humidity over land and ocean, and the greater
warming over land than ocean then implies a decrease in land relative humidity.
Evapotranspiration is of secondary importance for the increase in specific
humidity over land, but it matters more for the decrease in relative humidity.
Further analysis shows there is a strong feedback between changes in
surface-air temperature and relative humidity, and this can amplify the
influence on relative humidity of factors such as stomatal conductance and soil
moisture.

mixtures are apparently driven by relatively weak intermolecular forces (like
hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding) that often cooperate to form self
assembled structures, one expects the aggregation properties to show strong
temperature dependence. We study the effect of temperature on the formation of
transient ethanol clusters as well as on the dynamic density heterogeneity
induced in the system due to such clustering. The dynamic heterogeneity is
expected to occur on small length scales with short lifetime and both are
expected to be temperature dependent. Indeed, a major finding of the work is
strong temperature dependence of the extent of structural heterogeneity.
Distinct signature of static and dynamic heterogeneity of ethanol molecules is
also found to appear with lowering of temperature. This is attributed to the
formation of transient ethanol clusters that are known to exhibit considerably
small lifetime (order of a few picosecond). The transient dynamical features of
dynamic heterogeneity are expected to affect those relaxation processes
occurring at sub-picosecond time scales. On the other hand, strong temperature
dependence of micro-structure formation can be anticipated to be due to
enhanced structural order stimulated in the system with lowering of
temperature. Present analyses reveal a number of interesting features which

perfect absorption. We demonstrate and investigate super-resonant coherent
absorption in a coupled Fabry-Perot-ring cavity structure. At the FP resonant
wavelengths, the described phenomenon gives rise to split modes with a
nearly-transparent peak and a peak whose transmission is exceptionally
sensitive to the intracavity loss. For small losses, the effective interaction
pathlength of these modes is proportional respectively to the ratio and the
product of the individual finesse coefficients of the two resonators. The

paper aims at proposing a new approach for the design of effective action
classification systems. Taking as testbed publicly available three-dimensional
(MoCap) action/activity datasets, we analyzed and validated different
training/testing strategies. In particular, considering that each human action
in the datasets is performed several times by different subjects, we were able
to precisely quantify the effect of inter- and intra-subject variability, so as
to figure out the impact of several learning approaches in terms of
classification performance. The net result is that standard testing strategies
consisting in cross-validating the algorithm using typical splits of the data
(holdout, k-fold, or one-subject-out) is always outperformed by a
""personalization"" strategy which learns how a subject is performing an action.
In other words, it is advantageous to customize (i.e., personalize) the method
to learn the actions carried out by each subject, rather than trying to
generalize the actions executions across subjects. Consequently, we finally
propose an action recognition framework consisting of a two-stage
classification approach where, given a test action, the subject is first
identified before the actual recognition of the action takes place. Despite the
basic, off-the-shelf descriptors and standard classifiers adopted, we noted a
relevant increase in performance with respect to standard state-of-the-art
algorithms, so motivating the usage of personalized approaches for designing
effective action recognition systems.

communication to establish connection between nodes. Traditional infrastructure
based systems use a centralized architecture for address allocation. However,
this is not possible in Ad hoc networks due to their dynamic structure. Many
schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, but most of them use
network-wide broadcasts to ensure the availability of a new address. This
becomes extremely difficult as network size grows. In this paper, we propose an
address allocation algorithm which avoids network-wide broadcasts to allocate
address to a new node. Moreover, the algorithm allocates addresses dynamically
such that the network maintains an ""IP resembles topology"" state. In such a
state, routing becomes easier and the overall overhead in communication is
reduced. This algorithm is particularly useful for routing protocols which use
topology information to route messages in the network. Our solution is designed
with scalability in mind such that the cost of address assignment to a new node
is independent of the number of nodes in the network.

are investigated and it is found that the local bulk pressure and mean stress
are insufficient to explain the phenomenon. Results obtained in this study
strongly suggest that the viscous stress, interfacial contributions to the
local pressure, and the Laplace pressure are relevant to the opening of a vapor
cavity. This can be described by a generalization of Joseph's criterion that
includes these contributions. A macroscopic investigation measuring mass flow
rate behavior and discharge coefficient was also performed. As theoretically
predicted, mass flow rate increases linearly with the square root of the
pressure drop. However, when cavitation occurs, the mass flow growth rate is
reduced and eventually it collapses into a choked flow state. In the cavitating
regime, as theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, the discharge
coefficient grows with the Nurick cavitation number.

measurements, the actual path of the coupling current is unknown. In this

to increase the resistance between the filaments in non-stabilized samples. The
results are interpreted with a chain network model. This work provides useful
insights on the factors determining the transverse resistance in striated HTS

the analytic properties of their generating functions. This article provides
effective algorithms required for the study of analytic combinatorics in
several variables, together with their complexity analyses. Given a
multivariate rational function we show how to compute its smooth isolated
critical points, with respect to a polynomial map encoding asymptotic
behaviour, in complexity singly exponential in the degree of its denominator.
We introduce a numerical Kronecker representation for solutions of polynomial
systems with rational coefficients and show that it can be used to decide
several properties (0 coordinate, equal coordinates, sign conditions for real
solutions, and vanishing of a polynomial) in good bit complexity. Among the
critical points, those that are minimal---a property governed by inequalities
on the moduli of the coordinates---typically determine the dominant asymptotics
of the diagonal coefficient sequence. When the Taylor expansion at the origin
has all non-negative coefficients (known as the `combinatorial case') and under
regularity conditions, we utilize this Kronecker representation to determine
probabilistically the minimal critical points in complexity singly exponential
in the degree of the denominator, with good control over the exponent in the
bit complexity estimate. Generically in the combinatorial case, this allows one
to automatically and rigorously determine asymptotics for the diagonal
coefficient sequence. Examples obtained with a preliminary implementation show
the wide applicability of this approach.

contribution to these lines, a significant amount of neutral gas (~10^7 Msun)
is detected in a central region of ~1.75 kpc size. This neutral gas is
blueshifted by ~165 km/s with respect to the underlying galaxy. The mass
outflow of neutral gas is comparable to the star formation rate of the host
galaxy. Simultaneously, several emission lines (Ha, [NII], [SII]) are also
analysed looking for the ionised warm phase counterpart of the wind. A careful
kinematic decomposition of the line profiles reveals the presence of a
secondary, broader, kinematic component. This component is found roughly in the
same region where the NaI D absorption is detected. It presents higher [NII]/Ha
and [SII]/Ha line ratios than the narrow component at the same locations,
indicative of contamination by shock ionization. This secondary component also
presents blueshifted velocities, although smaller than those measured for the
neutral gas, averaging to ~ -30 km/s. The mass and mass outflow rate of the
wind is dominated by the neutral gas, of which a small fraction might be able
to escape the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. The observations in
this system can be readily understood within a bipolar gas flow scenario.

denoted ANewDsc, for isolating the real roots of a univariate real polynomial.
The method combines Descartes' Rule of Signs to test intervals for the
existence of roots, Newton iteration to speed up convergence against clusters
of roots, and approximate computation to decrease the required precision. It
achieves record bounds on the worst-case complexity for the considered problem,
matching the complexity of Pan's method for computing all complex roots and
improving upon the complexity of other subdivision methods by several
magnitudes.
  In the article at hand, we report on an implementation of ANewDsc on top of
the RS root isolator. RS is a highly efficient realization of the classical
Descartes method and currently serves as the default real root solver in Maple.
We describe crucial design changes within ANewDsc and RS that led to a
high-performance implementation without harming the theoretical complexity of
the underlying algorithm.
  With an excerpt of our extensive collection of benchmarks, available online
at http://anewdsc.mpi-inf.mpg.de/, we illustrate that the theoretical gain in
performance of ANewDsc over other subdivision methods also transfers into
practice. These experiments also show that our new implementation outperforms
both RS and mature competitors by magnitudes for notoriously hard instances
with clustered roots. For all other instances, we avoid almost any overhead by
integrating additional optimizations and heuristics.

Nano-grating on the surface imposes additional boundary conditions on the
electron wave function and reduces the density of states (DOS). When the
nano-grating dimensions are close to the de Broglie wavelength, the DOS
reduction is considerable and leads to changes in the layer properties. DOS
calculations are challenging to perform and are related to the quantum billiard
problem. Performing such calculations requires finding the solutions for the
time-independent Schrodinger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here,
we use a numerical method, namely the method of auxiliary sources, which offers
significant computational cost reduction relative to other numerical methods.
We found the first five eigenfunctions for the nano-grating layer and compared
them with the corresponding eigenfunctions for a plain layer by calculating the
correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the numerical data were used to analyze
the DOS reduction. The nano-grating is shown to reduce the probability of
occupation of a particular quantum state, reducing the integrated DOS by as
much as 4.1 -fold. This reduction in the DOS leads to considerable changes in
the electronic properties.

metallic surface state with an insulating bulk. Many efforts have been made in
understanding the corresponding physics behind in SmB6, but some puzzles on it,

the latest progress in our high pressure studies and the accumulating results

proposed method has been tested on handwritten samples of Bangla Basic,
Compound and mixed (Basic and Compound characters) characters separately with
SVM based classifier using a longest run based feature-set obtained from the
image subregions formed by a CG based quad-tree partitioning approach. Applying
this methodology on the above mentioned three types of datasets, respectively
43.75%, 12.5% and 37.5% gains have been achieved in terms of region reduction

accuracy. The results show a sizeable reduction in the minimal number of
descriptive regions as well a significant increase in recognition accuracy for
all the datasets using the proposed technique. Thus the time and cost related

smooth basis functions for geometric modelling and analysis. Manifold-based
surface construction techniques are well known in geometric modelling and a
number of variants exist. Common to all is the concept of constructing a smooth
surface by blending together overlapping patches (or, charts), as in
differential geometry description of manifolds. Each patch on the surface has a
corresponding planar patch with a smooth one-to-one mapping onto the surface.
In our implementation, manifold techniques are combined with conformal
parametrisations and the partition-of-unity method for deriving smooth basis
functions on unstructured quadrilateral meshes. Each vertex and its adjacent
elements on the surface control mesh have a corresponding planar patch of
elements. The star-shaped planar patch with congruent wedge-shaped elements is
smoothly parameterised with copies of a conformally mapped unit square. The
conformal maps can be easily inverted in order to compute the transition
functions between the different planar patches that have an overlap on the
surface. On the collection of star-shaped planar patches the partition of unity
method is used for approximation. The smooth partition of unity, or blending
functions, are assembled from tensor-product b-spline segments defined on a
unit square. On each patch a polynomial with a prescribed degree is used as a
local approximant. To obtain a mesh-based approximation scheme, the
coefficients of the local approximants are expressed in dependence of vertex
coefficients. This yields a basis function for each vertex of the mesh which is
smooth and non-zero over a vertex and its adjacent elements. Our numerical
simulations indicate the optimal convergence of the resulting approximation
scheme for Poisson problems and near optimal convergence for thin-plate and
thin-shell problems.

Rock-Scissors-Paper game with assumption about perfect memory of the playing
agents. At first we investigate the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the Nash
equilibrium as well as the dynamics on the boundary of codimension 1 - that is
when one of the strategies is not played by any agent. For the analysis of the
asymptotic behaviour close to the boundary of state space, we provide the
description of a naturally appearing heteroclinic network. Due to the symmetry,
the heteroclinic network induces a quotient network. This quotient network is
investigated as well. In the literature this model was already studied, but
unfortunately the results stated there are invalid, as we will show in this
paper. It turns out that certain types of behaviour are never possible or
appear in the system only for some parameter values, contradicting what was
stated before in the literature. Moreover, the parameter space (-1,1)x(-1,1) is
divided into four regions where we observe either irregular behaviour, or
preference to follow an itinerary consisting of strategies for which one or the
other agent does not lose, or they alternate in winning. These regions in
parameter space are separated by two analytical curves and lines where the game
is either symmetric (system is not $C^1$ linearisable at stationary saddle
points) or is zero-sum and the system is Hamiltonian. On each of these curves
we observe different bifurcation scenarios: e.g. transition from order to
chaos, or from one kind of stability to another kind, or just loss of one
dimension of the local stable manifold of the subcycle.

applications have recently received wide interests from both commercial and
research communities by using electric energy instead of traditional fuel
energy. Although EVs are inherently with limited travelling distance, such
limitation could be overcome by deploying public Charging Stations (CSs) to
recharge EVs battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novel
communication framework for on-the-move EV charging scenario, based on the
Publish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary CS information to
EVs, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A core
part of our communication framework is the utilization of Road Side Units
(RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regarded
as a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we
introduce two complementary communication modes of signalling protocols, namely
Push and Pull Modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination
operation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of Pull Mode, in
which the information is cached at RSUs to support asynchronous communication.
We further propose a remote reservation service based on the Pull Mode, such
that the CS-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of EVs'
charging reservation, as published from EVs through RSUs to CSs. Results show
that both the performance at CS and EV sides are further improved based on
using this anticipated information.

extended to show how such randomness affects the strength of nonlocal

the cryptographic principle such that a completely scrambled message cannot

thicknesses of 1.6 and 0.8 mm, respectively, with 2-mm-thick phenolic
high-pressure-laminated (HPL) plates. We examined the prototype RPCs for cosmic

maximum gamma rates of 1.5 kHz cm-2 provided by 137Cs sources at Korea
University and the GIF++ irradiation facility installed at the SPS H4 beam line
to examine the rate capabilities of the prototype RPCs. In contrast to the case
of the four-gap RPCs, we found the relatively high threshold was conducive to
effectively suppressing the rapid increase of strip cluster sizes of muon hits
with high voltage, especially when measuring the narrow-pitch strips. The
gamma-induced currents drawn in the four-gap RPC were about one-fourth of those
drawn in the double-gap RPC. The rate capabilities of both RPC types, proven
through the present testing using gamma-ray sources, far exceeded the maximum
rate expected in the new high-{\eta} endcap RPCs planned for future phase-II
LHC runs.

whether there exists a sequence of independent sets which transforms I into J
so that every pair of consecutive independent sets of the sequence can be
obtained via a token move. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even on
planar graphs.
  In 2014, Demaine et al. asked whether the Token Sliding reconfiguration
problem is polynomial time solvable on interval graphs and more generally in
chordal graphs. Yamada and Uehara showed in 2016 that a polynomial time

the result of Yamada and Uehara by showing that we can decide in polynomial
time whether two independent sets of an interval graph are in the same

determining if there exists a token sliding transformation between every pair

(ii) deciding this problem becomes co-NP-hard and even co-W[2]-hard

While SNSs provide diverse benefits for example, forstering interpersonal

uninvited nuiance. Spammers abuse SNSs as vehicles to spread spams rapidly and
widely. Spams, unsolicited or inappropriate messages, significantly impair the
credibility and reliability of services. Therefore, detecting spammers has
become an urgent and critical issue in SNSs. This paper deals with Follow spam
in Twitter. Instead of spreading annoying messages to the public, a spammer
follows (subscribes to) legitimate users, and followed a legitimate user. Based
on the assumption that the online relationships of spammers are different from
those of legitimate users, we proposed classification schemes that detect
follow spammers. Particularly, we focused on cascaded social relations and
devised two schemes, TSP-Filtering and SS-Filtering, each of which utilizes
Triad Significance Profile (TSP) and Social status (SS) in a two-hop subnetwork
centered at each other. We also propose an emsemble technique,
Cascaded-Filtering, that combine both TSP and SS properties. Our experiments on
real Twitter datasets demonstrated that the proposed three approaches are very
practical. The proposed schemes are scalable because instead of analyzing the
whole network, they inspect user-centered two hop social networks. Our
performance study showed that proposed methods yield significantly better

formulated approximately 30 years ago. The underlying geometric category is
based on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with parametrized boundary
components and the sewing operation. We survey the recent and careful study of
these objects, which has led to significant connections with quasiconformal
Teichmuller theory and geometric function theory.
  In particular we propose that the natural analytic setting for conformal
field theory is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with so-called
Weil-Petersson class parametrizations. A collection of rigorous analytic
results is advanced here as evidence. This class of parametrizations has the
required regularity for CFT on one hand, and on the other hand are natural and
of interest in their own right in geometric function theory.

applying a transformation to maximal $k$-uniform hypergraphs of bandwidth $b$

clique covering problem. The bandwidth of $G_{n,k,b}$ is thus the largest
possible bandwidth of any transformed $k$-uniform hypergraph of bandwidth $b$.
For $b\geq \frac{n+k-1}{2}$, the exact bandwidth of these graphs is determined.
For $b<\frac{n+k-1}{2}$, the bandwidth is asymptotically determined in the case
of $b=o(n)$ and in the case of $b$ growing linearly in $n$ with a factor $\beta

Weierstrass's ghost behind some of the received historiography on Euler's
infinitesimal mathematics, as when Ferraro proposes to understand Euler in
terms of a Weierstrassian notion of limit and Fraser declares classical
analysis to be a ""primary point of reference for understanding the
eighteenth-century theories."" Meanwhile, scholars like Bos and Laugwitz seek to
explore Eulerian methodology, practice, and procedures in a way more faithful
to Euler's own.
  Euler's use of infinite integers and the associated infinite products is
analyzed in the context of his infinite product decomposition for the sine
function. Euler's principle of cancellation is compared to the Leibnizian
transcendental law of homogeneity. The Leibnizian law of continuity similarly
finds echoes in Euler.
  We argue that Ferraro's assumption that Euler worked with a classical notion
of quantity is symptomatic of a post-Weierstrassian placement of Euler in the
Archimedean track for the development of analysis, as well as a blurring of the
distinction between the dual tracks noted by Bos. Interpreting Euler in an
Archimedean conceptual framework obscures important aspects of Euler's work.
Such a framework is profitably replaced by a syntactically more versatile
modern infinitesimal framework that provides better proxies for his inferential
moves.

imperfections that lead to debonding and slip under mechanical loading. Hence,
there have been numerous micromechanics studies to predict effective moduli of
the composites in the presence of partial alignment of fillers and interface
imperfections. In this study, we present an improved theory that overcomes two
limitations in the existing micromechanics based approaches. First, we find
that the interface damage tensor, which has been developed to model the
weakened interface between matrix and fillers, has singularities that cause
non-physical predictions (such as infinite or negative effective moduli). We
correct the mathematical mistakes to remove singularities and derive analytic
expressions of the damage tensor for ellipsoidal inclusions. Second, we reveal
that the previous theory on the effective moduli with axisymmetric filler
orientation distribution fails because the longitudinal and transverse moduli
do not converge in the limit of random orientation distribution. With
appropriate corrections, we derive an analytic expression for the orientation
average of arbitrary transversely isotropic 4th order tensor under general
axisymmetric orientation distribution. We apply the improved method to compute

policies has been concentrated largely on the case of policies with two
security domains, High and Low, because of a presumption that more general
policies can be reduced to this two-domain case. The details of the reduction
have not been the subject of careful study, however. Many works in the
literature use a reduction based on a quantification over ""Low-down""
partitionings of domains into those below and those not below a given domain in
the information flow order. A few use ""High-up"" partitionings of domains into
those above and those not above a given domain. Our paper argues that more
general ""cut"" partitionings are also appropriate, and studies the relationships
between the resulting multi-domain notions of security when the basic notion
for the two-domain case to which we reduce is either Nondeducibility on Inputs
or Generalized Noninterference. The Low-down reduction is shown to be weaker
than the others, and while the High-up reduction is sometimes equivalent to the
cut reduction, both it and the Low-down reduction may have an undesirable
property of non-monotonicity with respect to a natural ordering on policies.
These results suggest that the cut-based partitioning yields a more robust
general approach for reduction to the two-domain case.

HESS J1729-345 and HESS J1731-347 can be reproduced using core-collapse SN
models for HESS J1731-347. Starting with different progenitor stars and their
pre-supernova environment, we model potential SNR evolution histories along
with the CR acceleration in the SNR and the diffusion of the CRs. A simplified
3-dimensional structure of the MCs is introduced based on 12CO data, adopting a
distance of 3.2 kpc to the source. A Monte Carlo-based diffusion model for the
escaping CRs is developed to deal with the inhomogeneous environment. The fast
SNR forward shock speed as implied from the X-ray data can easily be explained
when employing scenarios with progenitor star masses between 20 and 25 solar
masses, where the SNR shock is still expanding inside the main sequence
(MS)-bubble at present time. The TeV spectrum of HESS J1729-345 is
satisfactorily fitted by the emission from the highest-energy CRs that have
escaped the SNR, using a standard galactic CR diffusion coefficient in the
inter-clump medium. The TeV image of HESS J1729-345 can be explained with a
reasonable 3-dimensional structure of MCs. The TeV emission from the SNR itself
is dominated by leptonic emission in this model. We also explore scenarios
where the shock is starting to encounter the dense MS progenitor wind bubble
shell.

may calibrate an effective M(z). This calibration involves a scale which
depends on the cosmological model, however the evolution of the effective M(z)

line of sight BAO scale can be used to extend this calibration to redshifts
near z. As an application, using BOSS BAO at z=0.32 and 2.34, JLA supernova at

synchronization and the degree of order in a collection of diffusively moving
noisy oscillators. We address this by constructing a generic hydrodynamic
theory for active phase fluctuations in a collection of large number of nearly
phase-coherent moving oscillators in two dimensions. Our theory describes the
general situation where phase fluctuations and oscillator mobility mutually
affect each other. We show that the interplay between the active effects and
the mobility of the oscillators leads to a variety of phenomena, ranging from
synchronization with long range, nearly long range and quasi long range orders
to instabilities and desynchronization with short range order of the oscillator
phases. We highlight the complex dependences of synchronization on the active
effects. These should be testable in wide ranging systems, e.g., oscillating
chemical reactions in the presence of different reaction

implementation can be very time consuming and requires the programmer to have

optimisation techniques on manycore CPUs. In this paper we show how the
development of bespoke multigrid preconditioners can be simplified
significantly by using a framework which allows the expression of the each

allows the expression of the finite element problem in a language which is
close to the mathematical formulation of the problem, (2) guarantees the
automatic generation and efficient execution of parallel optimised low-level
computer code and (3) is flexible enough to support different abstraction
levels and give the programmer control over details of the preconditioner. We
use the composable abstractions of the Firedrake/PyOP2 package to demonstrate
the efficiency of this approach for the solution of strongly anisotropic PDEs
in atmospheric modelling. The weak formulation of the PDE is expressed in
Unified Form Language (UFL) and the lower PyOP2 abstraction layer allows the
manual design of computational kernels for a bespoke geometric multigrid
preconditioner. We compare the performance of this preconditioner to a
single-level method and hypre's BoomerAMG algorithm. The Firedrake/PyOP2 code
is inherently parallel and we present a detailed performance analysis for a

valid but potentially conservative coverage in models with reduced-form

emission lines of CO and H2O towards four M-type AGB stars. We focus on
spectrally resolved observations of CO and H2O from HIFI. The observations are
complemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and
H2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity
structure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO
intensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O
observations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally,
the radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE,
in principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles
only set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower
acceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by
dynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the
temperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was
only possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an
ad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme
cooling in the inner CSE. H2O line cooling was therefore excluded from the
models. The constraints set on the temperature profile by the CO lines
nevertheless allowed us to derive H2O abundances. The derived H2O abundances
confirm previous estimates and are consistent with chemical models. However,
the uncertainties in the derived abundances are relatively large, in particular
for p-H2O, and consequently the derived o/p-H2O ratios are not well

continuously distributed variable - wealth. Agents move to neighborhoods where
their wealth is not lesser than that of some proportion of their neighbors, the
threshold level. As in the case of the classic Schelling model where
segregation obtains between two races, we find here that wealth-based
segregation occurs and persists. However, introducing uncertainty into the
decision to move - that is, with some probability, if agents are allowed to
move even though the threshold level condition is contravened - we find that
even for small proportions of such disallowed moves, the dynamics no longer
yield segregation but instead sharply transition into a persistent mixed wealth
distribution. We investigate the nature of this sharp transformation between
segregated and mixed states, and find that it is because of a non-linear
relationship between allowed moves and disallowed moves. For small increases in
disallowed moves, there is a rapid corresponding increase in allowed moves, but
this tapers off as the fraction of disallowed moves increase further and
finally settles at a stable value, remaining invariant to any further increase
in disallowed moves. It is the overall effect of the dynamics in the initial
region (with small numbers of disallowed moves) that shifts the system away
from a state of segregation rapidly to a mixed wealth state.
  The contravention of the tolerance condition could be interpreted as public
policy interventions like minimal levels of social housing or housing benefit
transfers to poorer households. Our finding therefore suggests that it might
require only very limited levels of such public intervention - just sufficient
to enable a small fraction of disallowed moves, because the dynamics generated
by such moves could spur the transformation from a segregated to mixed
equilibrium.

$\ell_1$-regularization becomes ineffective in the presence of simplex
constraints, i.e.,~the target is known to have non-negative entries summing up
to a given constant. The situation is analogous for the use of nuclear norm
regularization for low-rank recovery of Hermitian positive semidefinite
matrices with given trace. In the present paper, we discuss several strategies
to deal with this situation, from simple to more complex. As a starting point,
we consider empirical risk minimization (ERM). It follows from existing theory
that ERM enjoys better theoretical properties w.r.t.~prediction and
$\ell_2$-estimation error than $\ell_1$-regularization. In light of this, we
argue that ERM combined with a subsequent sparsification step like thresholding
is superior to the heuristic of using $\ell_1$-regularization after dropping
the sum constraint and subsequent normalization.
  At the next level, we show that any sparsity-promoting regularizer under
simplex constraints cannot be convex. A novel sparsity-promoting regularization
scheme based on the inverse or negative of the squared $\ell_2$-norm is
proposed, which avoids shortcomings of various alternative methods from the
literature. Our approach naturally extends to Hermitian positive semidefinite
matrices with given trace. Numerical studies concerning compressed sensing,
sparse mixture density estimation, portfolio optimization and quantum state
tomography are used to illustrate the key points of the paper.

an energy consumption based comparison of different beamforming schemes while
considering both a low power and a high power analog-to-digital converter (ADC)

positioning information is already available) can result in a lower energy
consumption, while in all other scenarios digital beamforming has a lower
energy consumption than analog and hybrid beamforming. We also show that under
certain scenarios recently proposed phase shifters network architecture can
result in a lower energy consumption than other beamforming schemes. Moreover,
we show that the energy consumption trend among different beamforming schemes
is valid irrespective of the number of ADC bits. Finally, we propose a new

after its ""birth"". Nonetheless, from the moment a paper is published it exists
within the evolving web of other papers, thus, its actual meaning to the reader
changes. To track how scientific ideas (represented by groups of scientific

speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at any location in the inner
heliosphere. This new approach enables the adoption of a highly flexible
geometrical shape for the CME front with an adjustable CME angular width and an
adjustable radius of curvature of its leading edge, i.e. the assumed geometry
is elliptical. Using, as input, STEREO heliospheric imager (HI) observations, a
new elliptic conversion (ElCon) method is introduced and combined with the use
of drag-based model (DBM) fitting to quantify the deceleration or acceleration
experienced by CMEs during propagation. The result is then used as input for
the Ellipse Evolution Model (ElEvo). Together, ElCon, DBM fitting, and ElEvo
form the novel ElEvoHI forecasting utility. To demonstrate the applicability of
ElEvoHI, we forecast the arrival times and speeds of 21 CMEs remotely observed
from STEREO/HI and compare them to in situ arrival times and speeds at 1 AU.
Compared to the commonly used STEREO/HI fitting techniques (Fixed-$\Phi$,
Harmonic Mean, and Self-similar Expansion fitting), ElEvoHI improves the
arrival time forecast by about 2 hours to $\pm 6.5$ hours and the arrival speed
forecast by $\approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\pm 53$ km s$^{-1}$, depending on the
ellipse aspect ratio assumed. In particular, the remarkable improvement of the
arrival speed prediction is potentially beneficial for predicting geomagnetic
storm strength at Earth.

become turbulent. We address the question whether turbulence enhances the
energy conversion rate of plasmoid-unstable current sheets. We carry out
appropriate numerical MHD simulations, but resolving simultaneously the
relevant large-scale (mean-) fields and the corresponding small-scale,
turbulent, quantities by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) is not
possible. Hence we investigate the influence of small scale turbulence on large
scale MHD processes by utilizing a subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. We
verify the applicability of our SGS model and then use it to investigate the
influence of turbulence on the plasmoid instability. We start the simulations
with Harris-type and force-free CS equilibria in the presence of a finite guide
field in the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. We use the DNS
results to investigate the growth of the plasmoid instability. The energy and
cross-helicity due to turbulence are obtained in terms of the mean fields by a
Gaussian filtering formulation from a Reynolds averaging turbulence model. The
influence of turbulence on the reconnection rate of the plasmoid instability is
investigated. To verify the predictions of the SGS-model, the electromotive
force (${\bf\cal{E}}$) is calculated for the coarse data obtained by filtering
and compared to the SGS-model. The symmetry breakage with respect to the guide
field direction causes a turbulent helicity which reduces the influence of the
apparent turbulent resistivity. The reduced reconnection rate of guide field
plasmoid reconnection is attributed to a balancing between the different
physical effects related to turbulence.

  decomposability","25 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an edge-colored graph, the cost incurred at a vertex on a path when two
incident edges with different colors are traversed is called reload or
changeover cost. The ""Minimum Changeover Cost Arborescence"" (MINCCA) problem
consists in finding an arborescence with a given root vertex such that the
total changeover cost of the internal vertices is minimized. It has been
recently proved by G\""oz\""upek et al. [TCS 2016] that the problem is FPT when
parameterized by the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph. In
this article we present the following results for the MINCCA problem:
  - the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the treedepth of the input graph,
even on graphs of average degree at most 8. In particular, it is W[1]-hard
parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph, which answers the main open
problem of G\""oz\""upek et al. [TCS 2016];
  - it is W[1]-hard on multigraphs parameterized by the tree-cutwidth of the
input multigraph;
  - it is FPT parameterized by the star tree-cutwidth of the input graph, which
is a slightly restricted version of tree-cutwidth. This result strictly
generalizes the FPT result given in G\""oz\""upek et al. [TCS 2016];
  - it remains NP-hard on planar graphs even when restricted to instances with
at most 6 colors and 0/1 symmetric costs, or when restricted to instances with
at most 8 colors, maximum degree bounded by 4, and 0/1 symmetric costs.

model or use the CUSUM method under classical assumptions on model errors. This
paper considers the sequential change-point detection in a nonlinear quantile

is proposed and studied. Under null hypothesis that the model does not change,
the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is determined. Under
alternative hypothesis that at some unknown observation there is a change in

resonance spectroscopies and related techniques, including Ramsey's method of
separated oscillatory fields used in atomic clocks. Previously established for
atomic, molecular and quantum dot systems, recent developments in the optical
quantum state preparation of free electron beams suggest a transfer of such
concepts to the realm of ultrafast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Here, we
demonstrate the sequential coherent interaction of free electron states with
two spatially separated, phase-controlled optical near-fields. Ultrashort
electron pulses are acted upon in a tailored nanostructure featuring two
near-field regions with anisotropic polarization response. The amplitude and
relative phase of these two near-fields are independently controlled by the
incident polarization state, allowing for constructive and destructive quantum
interference of the subsequent interactions. Future implementations of such
electron-light interferometers may yield unprecedented access to optically
phase-resolved electronic dynamics and dephasing mechanisms with attosecond

cluster dianions. This unusual double electron transfer appears to be concerted
and is most likely guided by electron correlation between the two very weakly
bound outer electrons in $He^{-}$. We suggest a mechanism which involves long
range electron transfer followed by the conversion of $He^{+}$ into
$He_{2}^{+}$, where formation of the $He-He$ bond in $He_{2}^{+}$ releases
sufficient kinetic energy for the cation and the dianion to escape their
Coulombic attraction. By analogy with the corresponding dications, the
observation of a threshold size of n \geq 5 for formation of both
$(C_{60})_n^{2-}$ and $(C_{70})_n^{2-}$ is attributed to Coulomb explosion
rather than an energetic constraint. We also find that smaller dianions can be
observed if water is added as a co-dopant. Other aspects of $He^{-}$ chemistry
that are explored include its role in the formation of multiply charged
fullerene cluster cations and the sensitivity of cluster dianion formation on
the incident electron energy.

charging schedules can be shifted over the course of a day without impacting
drivers mobility. This property can be exploited to reduce charging costs and
adverse network impacts. The increasing number of PEVs makes the use of
distributed charging coordinating strategies preferable to centralized ones. In
this paper, we propose an agent-based method which enables a fully distributed
solution of the PEVs Coordinated Charging (PEV-CC) problem. This problem aims
at coordinating the charging schedules of a fleet of PEVs to minimize costs of
serving demand subject to individual PEV constraints originating from battery
limitations and charging infrastructure characteristics. In our proposed
approach, each PEVs charging station is considered as an agent that is equipped
with communication and computation capabilities. Our multiagent approach is an
iterative procedure which finds a distributed solution for the first order
optimality conditions of the underlying optimization problem through local
computations and limited information exchange with neighboring agents. In
particular, the updates for each agent incorporate local information such as
the Lagrange multipliers, as well as enforcing the local PEVs constraints as
local innovation terms. Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is
evaluated on a fleet of 100 PEVs as a test case, and the results are compared
with the centralized solution of the PEV-CC problem.
