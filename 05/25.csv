location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) where the response distribution is not
restricted to belong to the exponential family and its parameters can be
specified as functions of additive predictors that allows for several types of
covariate effects (e.g., linear, non-linear, random and spatial effects). In
many empirical situations, however, modeling simultaneously two or more
responses conditional on some covariates can be of considerable relevance. In
this article, we extend the scope of GAMLSS by introducing a bivariate copula
additive model with continuous margins for location, scale and shape. The
framework permits the copula dependence and marginal distribution parameters to
be estimated simultaneously and, like in GAMLSS, each parameter to be modeled
using an additive predictor. Parameter estimation is achieved within a
penalized likelihood framework using a trust region algorithm with integrated
automatic multiple smoothing parameter selection. The proposed approach allows
for straightforward inclusion of potentially any parametric continuous marginal
distribution and copula function. The models can be easily used via the
copulaReg() function in the R package SemiParBIVProbit. The usefulness of the
proposal is illustrated on two case studies (which use electricity price and
demand data, and birth records) and on simulated data.

methods, which we call the inexact regularized proximal Newton
($\textsf{IRPN}$) method, for minimizing the sum of two closed proper convex
functions, one of which is smooth and the other is possibly non-smooth. Our
proposed method features strong convergence guarantees even when applied to
problems with degenerate solutions while allowing the inner minimization to be
solved inexactly. Specifically, we prove that when the problem possesses the
so-called Luo-Tseng error bound (EB) property, $\textsf{IRPN}$ converges
globally to an optimal solution, and the local convergence rate of the sequence
of iterates generated by $\textsf{IRPN}$ is linear, superlinear, or even
quadratic, depending on the choice of parameters of the algorithm. Prior to
this work, such EB property has been extensively used to establish the linear
convergence of various first-order methods. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to use the Luo-Tseng EB property to establish
the superlinear convergence of SQA-type methods for non-smooth convex
minimization. As a consequence of our result, $\textsf{IRPN}$ is capable of
solving regularized regression or classification problems under the
high-dimensional setting with provable convergence guarantees. We compare our
proposed $\textsf{IRPN}$ with several empirically efficient algorithms by
applying them to the $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression problem.
Experiment results show the competitiveness of our proposed method.

problem with numerous applications, e.g., in quantum information processing.
The problem is even more challenging in the setting of open quantum systems,
where environment-mediated transitions introduce additional decoherence
channels. Adiabatic passage is a well established solution, but requires a
sufficiently slow evolution time that is dictated by the adiabatic theorem.
Here we develop a systematic projection theory formulation for the
transitionless evolution of general open quantum systems described by
time-local master equations. We derive a time-convolutionless dynamical
equation for the target instantaneous eigenstate of a given time-dependent
Hamiltonian. A transitionless dynamics then arises in terms of a competition
between the average Hamiltonian gap and the decoherence rate, which implies
optimal adiabaticity timescales. We show how eigenstate tracking can be
accomplished via control pulses, without explicitly incorporating
counter-diabatic driving, thus offering an alternative route to shortcuts to
adiabaticity. We examine rectangular pulses, chaotic signals, and white noise,
and find that, remarkably, the effectiveness of eigenstate tracking hardly
depends on the details of the control functions. In all cases the control
protocol keeps the system in the desired instantaneous eigenstate throughout
the entire evolution, along an accelerated adiabatic path.

  2017",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target
of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,
one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the
Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing
advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous
Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin
traffic.
  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on
Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and
large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we
show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency
of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in
terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker
can hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even
when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that
on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by
interfering with few key Bitcoin messages.
  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin
software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology
using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.
  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the
network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount
of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide
range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,
we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be
deployed immediately.

remove the non-localities that arise in boundary conformal theories that border
hyperbolic spaces on AdS$_5$. Specifically, using the
Caffarelli/Silvestri\cite{caffarelli}, Graham/Zworski\cite{graham}, and
Chang/Gonzalez\cite{chang:2010} extension theorems, we prove that the boundary
operator conjugate to bulk p-forms with negative mass in geodesically complete
metrics is inherently a non-local operator, specifically the fractional
conformal Laplacian. The non-locality, which arises even in compact spaces,
applies to any degree p-form such as a gauge field. We show that the boundary
theory contains fractional derivatives of the longitudinal components of the
gauge field if the gauge field in the bulk along the holographic direction
acquires a mass via the Higgs mechanism. The non-locality is shown to vanish
once the metric becomes incomplete, for example, either 1) asymptotically by
adding N transversely stacked Dd-branes or 2) exactly by giving the boundary a
brane structure and including a single transverse Dd-brane in the bulk. The
original Maldacena conjecture within IIB string theory corresponds to the
former. In either of these proposals, the location of the Dd-branes places an
upper bound on the entanglement entropy because the minimal bulk surface in the
AdS reduction is ill-defined at a brane interface. Since the brane
singularities can be circumvented in the full 10-dimensional spacetime, we
conjecture that the true entanglement entropy must be computed from the minimal
surface in 10-dimensions, which is of course not minimal in the AdS$_5$
reduction.

knowledge of this famous cluster. We produced a series of 32 young massive
clusters using the NBODY6 code. Each cluster was tracked with adequate temporal
samples to follow the evolution of R136 during its early stages. To compare the
NBODY6 simulations with observational data, we created the synthetic images
from the output of the code. We used the TLUSTY and KURUCZ model atmospheres to
produce the fluxes in HST/ WFPC2 filters. GENEVA isochrones were used to track
the evolution of stars. Then, we derived the observable parameters from
synthetic scenes at the spatial resolution of HST/WFPC2 in the F814W filter
(790.48nm). Surface brightness profile of the cluster, half-light radius, mass
function and neighbor radius were used to select the best representation of
R136. We compared the simulations of R136 to its HST imagery by creating
synthetic scenes at the same resolution, pixel scale and FOV of the HST. We
applied the same photometric analysis of the images as of the real ones. Having
extracted the stellar sources, we estimated the mass-function, the surface
brightness profile, the half-light radius and the neighbor radius across R136.
The interpretation of these criteria point to the fact that an initially
non-segregated cluster scenario is more representative of R136. This result
pleads for the formation of massive stars by accretion instead of collision.

transition states and reaction pathways in addition to the significant
energetically low-lying local minima is a computationally demanding task. We
here introduce a computationally efficient method that is based on a
combination of the minima hopping global optimization method and the insight
that uphill barriers tend to increase with increasing structural distances of
the educt and product states. This method allows to replace the exact

approximate concepts. Without adding any significant additional cost to the

an analysis, the gained knowledge can be used to make a decision if it is
worthwhile or not to invest computational resources for an exact computation of

one-dimensional quantum walks using delocalized initial states of the walker.
Since the quantum walks can be performed on any quantum system, our proposal
enables a platform-independent realization of the cat states. We further show
that the linear dispersion relation of the effective quantum walk Hamiltonian,
which governs the dynamics of the delocalized states, is responsible for the
formation of the cat states. We analyze the robustness of these states against
environmental interactions and present methods to control and manipulate the
cat states in the photonic implementation of quantum walks.

mass function (HMF). It enters most cosmological analyses and parametrizes how
the linear growth of primordial perturbations is connected to these abundances.
Interestingly, this connection can be made approximately cosmology independent.
This made it possible to map in detail its near-universal behavior through
large-scale simulations. However, such simulations may suffer from systematic
effects, especially if baryonic physics is included. In this paper we ask how
well observations can constrain directly the HMF. The observables we consider
are galaxy cluster number counts, galaxy cluster power spectrum and lensing of
type Ia supernovae. Our results show that DES is capable of putting the first
meaningful constraints on the HMF, while both Euclid and J-PAS can give
stronger constraints, comparable to the ones from state-of-the-art simulations.
We also find that an independent measurement of cluster masses is even more
important for measuring the HMF than for constraining the cosmological
parameters, and can vastly improve the determination of the halo mass function.
Measuring the HMF could thus be used to cross-check simulations and their
implementation of baryon physics. It could even, if deviations cannot be
accounted for, hint at new physics.

a highly Boltzmann like distribution [ indicating equilibration. These
equilibrated data however do not contain much useful information about the
dynamics which lead to equilibration. To illuminate the dynamics, special
Hamiltonians can be chosen which contain large energy barriers. In this paper
we generalize this approach by considering a class of Hamiltonians which map
clusters of spin-like qubits into 'superspins', thereby creating an energy
landscape where local minima are separated by large energy barriers. These
large energy barriers allow us to observe signatures of the transverse field
frozen. To study these systems, we assume that the these frozen spins are
describes by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism which was originally developed to
describe formation of topological defects in the early universe. It was soon
realized that it also has applications in analogous superconductor systems and
later realized to also be important for the transverse field Ising model . We
demonstrate that these barriers block equilibration and yield a non-trivial
distribution of qubit states in a regime where quantum effects are expected to
be strong, suggesting that these data should contain signatures of whether the
dynamics are fundamentally classical or quantum. We exhaustively study a class
of 3x3 square lattice superspin Hamiltonians and compare the experimental
results with those obtained by exact diagonalisation. We find that the best fit
to the data occurs at finite transverse field. We further demonstrate that
under the right conditions, the superspins can be relaxed to equilibrium,
erasing the signature of the transverse field. These results are interesting
for a number of reasons. They suggest a route to detect signatures of quantum
mechanics on the device on a statistical level.

contain significant amounts of dust, which is likely to be of external origin.
In order to characterize the mid-IR properties of two of the most nearby and
brightest merger-remnant radio galaxies of the Southern hemisphere, NGC 1316
(Fornax A) and NGC 612 (PKS 0131-36), we used observations with the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 micron
and Spitzer mid-infrared spectra. By applying a resolution-enhancement
technique, new WISE images were produced at angular resolutions ranging from
2.6"" to 5.5"". Global measurements were performed in the four WISE bands, and
stellar masses and star-formation rates were estimated using published scaling
relations. Two methods were used to uncover the distribution of dust, one
relying on two-dimensional fits to the 3.4 micron images to model the
starlight, and the other one using a simple scaling and subtraction of the 3.4
micron images to estimate the stellar continuum contribution to the emission in
the 12 and 22 micron bands. The two galaxies differ markedly in their mid-IR
properties. The 3.4 micron brightness distribution can be well represented by
the superposition of two Sersic models in NGC 1316 and by a Sersic model and an
exponential disk in NGC 612. The WISE colors of NGC 1316 are typical of those
of early-type galaxies; those of NGC 612 are in the range found for
star-forming galaxies. From the 22 micron luminosity, we infer a star-formation
rate of about 0.7 solar masses per year in NGC 1316 and about 7 solar masses
per year in NGC 612. Spitzer spectroscopy shows that the 7.7-to-11.3 micron PAH
line ratio is significantly lower in NGC 1316 than in NGC 612. The WISE images
reveal resolved emission from dust in the central 1'-2' of the galaxies.

  grain patterns","18 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate prediction of the macroscopic flow parameters needed to describe
flow in porous media relies on a good knowledge of flow field distribution at a
much smaller scale---in the pore spaces. The extent of the inertial effect in
the pore spaces can not be underestimated yet is often ignored in large-scale
simulations of fluid flow. We present a multiscale method for solving Oseen's
approximation of incompressible flow in the pore spaces amid non-periodic grain
patterns. The method is based on the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM
[Hou and Wu, 1997]) and is built in the vein of Crouzeix-Raviart elements
[Crouzeix and Raviart, 1973]. Simulations of inertial flow in highly
non-periodic settings are conducted and presented. Convergence studies in terms
of numerical errors relative to the reference solution are given to demonstrate
the accuracy of our method. The weakly enforced continuity across coarse
element edges is shown to maintain accurate solutions in the vicinity of the
grains without the need for any oversampling methods. The penalization method
is employed to allow a complicated grain pattern to be modeled using a simple
Cartesian mesh. This work is a stepping stone towards solving the more
complicated Navier-Stokes equations with a non-linear inertial term.

particles in a fluid suppresses the usual demixing phase transition to very low
particle concentrations, allowing for the formation of open, percolated, and
homogeneous states, aptly called equilibrium or ""empty"" gels. Most
demonstrations of this concept have directly limited the microscopic particle
valence via anisotropic (patchy) attractions; however, an alternative
macroscopic valence limitation would be desirable for greater experimental
tunability and responsiveness. One possibility, explored in this paper, is to
employ primary particles with attractions mediated via a secondary species of
linking particles. In such a system, the linker-to-primary particle ratio
serves as a macroscopic control parameter for the average microscopic valence.
We show that the phase behavior of such a system predicted by Wertheim's first
order perturbation theory is consistent with equilibrium gel formation: the
primary particle concentrations corresponding to the two-phase demixing
transition are significantly suppressed at both low and high linker-to-primary
particle ratios. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations validate these
theoretical predictions but also reveal the presence of loops of bonded
particles, which are neglected in the theory. Such loops cause densification
and inhibit percolation, and hence the range of viable empty gel state
conditions is somewhat reduced relative to the Wertheim theory predictions.

anisotropic XY model with an alternating transverse magnetic field, which is
equivalent to a two-component one-dimensional Fermi gas on a lattice, a system
realizable with current technology. Apart from the antiferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases, the model possesses a dimer phase which is not present in
the transverse XY model. At zero temperature, we find that the first derivative
of bipartite entanglement can detect all the three phases. We analytically show
that the model has a ""factorization line"" on the plane of system parameters, in
which the zero temperature state is separable. Along with investigating the
effect of temperature on entanglement in a phase plane, we also report a
non-monotonic behavior of entanglement with respect to temperature in the
anti-ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which is surprisingly absent in the
dimer phase. Since the time dynamics of entanglement in a realizable physical
system plays an important role in quantum information processing tasks, the
evolutions of entanglement at small as well as large time are examined.
Consideration of large time behavior of entanglement helps us to prove that in
this model, entanglement is always ergodic. We observe that other quantum
correlation measures can qualitatively show similar features in zero and finite
temperatures. However, unlike nearest-neighbor entanglement, the
nearest-neighbor information theoretic measures can be both ergodic as well as
non-ergodic, depending on the system parameters.

A plausible
explanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal

producing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane. Once formed,
methane storage on Mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden
clathrate reservoirs. Here, we alternatively suggest that chabazite and
clinoptilolite, which belong to the family of zeolites, may form a plausible
storage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface. Because of the
existence of many volcanic terrains, zeolites are expected to be widespread on
Mars and their Global Equivalent Layer may range up to more than $\sim$1 km,
according to the most optimistic estimates. If the martian methane present in
chabazite and clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the
subsurface, the destabilization of a localized layer of a few millimeters per
year may be sufficient to explain the current observations. The sporadic
release of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained
isolated from the atmosphere during its evolution. The methane release over the
ages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts, seismic activity or
erosion. If the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite and/or
clinoptilolite prevails on Mars, then the presence of these zeolites around
Gale Crater could explain the variation of methane level observed by Mars

briefly recall the index theorem on $S^1\times R^3$ for twisted adjoint
fermions in a BPS dyon background of arbitrary holonomy, and use the ADHM
construction to explicit the adjoint anti-periodic zero modes. We use these
results to derive the partition function of an interacting instanton-dyon
ensemble with $N_f$ light and anti-periodic adjoint quarks. We develop the
model in details by mapping the theory on a 3-dimensional quantum effective
theory with adjoint quarks with manifest $SU(N_f)\times Z_{4N_f}$ symmetry.
Using a mean-field analysis at weak coupling and strong screening, we show that
center symmetry requires the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which is
shown to only take place for $N_f=1$. For a sufficiently dense liquid, we find
that the ground state is center symmetric and breaks spontaneously flavor
symmetry through $SU(N_f)\times Z_{4N_f}\rightarrow O(N_f)$. As the liquid
dilutes with increasing temperature, center symmetry and chiral symmetry are
restored. We present numerical and analytical estimates for the transition
temperatures.

the dynamical processes that occur on top of them. Here, inspired by one
specific model of random walks that seems to be ubiquitous across many
scientific fields, the Levy flight, we study a new navigation strategy on top

theories, we derive analytical expressions for the mean first passage time and
the average time to reach a node on these networks. Moreover, we also explore
the efficiency of Levy random walks, which we found to be very different as
compared to the single layer scenario, accounting for the structure and

other important random walk processes defined on multiplex networks, we find
that in some region of the parameters, a Levy random walk is the most efficient

show the importance of considering the topological structure of multiplex

$\rho$ satisfying $\rho[r, \infty) \asymp r^{-\alpha}$. We prove that this

the plane is completely covered by the ellipses, almost surely. For $\alpha \in

particle size predictions from the scattering of the comet-like tail pointed
towards a dust size of ~0.1 um for silicate compositions. These small particles
would produce a much deeper optical transit depth than near-infrared transit
depth. We measure a transmission spectrum for KIC 12557548b using the SpeX
spectrograph (covering 0.8 um to 2.4 um) simultaneously with the MORIS imager
taking r' (0.63 um) photometry on the Infrared Telescope Facility for eight
nights and one night in H band (1.63 um) using the Wide-Field IR Camera at the

errors, but we argue that sufficient precision is obtained when using
differential spectroscopic calibration when combining multiple nights. The
average differential transmission spectrum is flat, supporting findings that
KIC 12557548b's debris is likely composed of larger particles > ~0.5 um for

regime where plasma is in the liquid state and, therefore, the conductivity is
dominated by the electron scattering off correlated nuclei. The dynamical
screening of this interaction is implemented in terms of the polarization
tensor computed in the hard-thermal-loop effective field theory of QED plasma.
The correlations of the background ionic component are accounted for via a
structure factor derived from Monte Carlo simulations of one-component plasma.
With this input we solve the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time
approximation taking into account the anisotropy of transport due to the
magnetic field. The electrical conductivity tensor is studied numerically as a
function of temperature and density for carbon and iron nuclei as well as
density-dependent composition of zero-temperature dense matter in weak

understanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic
biases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and
subtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a
suppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a
suppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond
the thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency
scales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or
avoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due
to the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be
the dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of
diffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an
incomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show
that calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals
and introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and
excess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in
the model with respect to the flux of modeled sources. We discuss possible
solutions such as using only long baselines to calibrate the interferometric

lensing strength has revealed the greatest numbers of multiply-imaged galaxies
available to constrain models of cluster mass distributions. However, even with
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ images per cluster, the uncertainties associated with the
reconstructions are not negligible. The goal of this paper is to show the
diversity of model magnification predictions. We examine 7 and 9 mass models of
Abell 2744 and MACS J0416, respectively, submitted to the Mikulski Archive for
Space Telescopes for public distribution in September 2015. The dispersion
between model predictions increases from 30% at common low magnifications
($\mu\sim2$) to 70% at rare high magnifications ($\mu\sim40$). MACS J0416
exhibits smaller dispersions than Abell 2744 for $2<\mu<10$. We show that
magnification maps based on different lens inversion techniques typically
differ from each other by more than their quoted statistical errors. This
suggests that some models underestimate the true uncertainties, which are
primarily due to various lensing degeneracies. Though the exact mass sheet
degeneracy is broken, its generalized counterpart is not broken at least in
Abell 2744. Other, local degeneracies are also present in both clusters. Our
comparison of models is complementary to the comparison of reconstructions of
known synthetic mass distributions. By focusing on observed clusters, we can
identify those that are best constrained, and therefore provide the clearest
view of the distant Universe.

are, respectively, the gas and SF rate surface densities, even when the physics
of star formation is the same. This is because the SF relation of nearby clouds
relates gas and star surface densities measured locally, that is, within a
given interval of gas surface density, or at a given protostar location. We
refer to such measurements as local measurements, and the corresponding SF
relation as the local relation. In contrast, the stellar content of a distant
molecular clump remains unresolved. Only the mean SF rate can be obtained from
e.g. the clump infrared luminosity. One clump therefore provides one single
point to the ($\Sigma_{gas}$, $\Sigma_{SFR}$) space, that is, its mean gas
surface density and SF rate surface density. We refer to this SF relation as a
global relation since it builds on the global properties of molecular clumps.
Its definition therefore requires an ensemble of cluster-forming clumps. We
show that, although the local and global relations have different slopes, this
per se cannot be taken as evidence for a change in the physics of SF with gas
surface density. It therefore appears that great caution should be taken when
physically interpreting a composite SF relation, that is, a relation combining

galaxy population above $M_{*}\sim 2 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, where their
numbers have increased by a factor of $\sim25$ since $z\sim2$. Once star
formation is initially shut down, perhaps during the quasar phase of rapid
accretion onto a supermassive black hole, an unknown mechanism must remove or
heat subsequently accreted gas from stellar mass loss or mergers that would
otherwise cool to form stars. Energy output from a black hole accreting at a
low rate has been proposed, but observational evidence for this in the form of
expanding hot gas shells is indirect and limited to radio galaxies at the
centers of clusters, which are too rare to explain the vast majority of the
quiescent population. Here we report bisymmetric emission features co-aligned
with strong ionized gas velocity gradients from which we infer the presence of
centrally-driven winds in typical quiescent galaxies that host low-luminosity
active nuclei. These galaxies are surprisingly common, accounting for as much
as $10\%$ of the population at $M_* \sim 2 \times 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$. In a
prototypical example, we calculate that the energy input from the galaxy's
low-level active nucleus is capable of driving the observed wind, which
contains sufficient mechanical energy to heat ambient, cooler gas (also
detected) and thereby suppress star formation.

zone, these two insulators are adiabatically connected, i.e. we can deform one
insulator into the other smoothly without closing the band gap. In addition, we
further prove that this adiabatic path preserves all the symmetries of the
insulators. The existence of such an adiabatic path implies that two insulators
with nonzero wavefunction overlap belong to the same topological phase. This
relation, between adiabatic continuity and wavefunction overlap, can be further
generalized to correlated systems. The generalized relation cannot be applied
to study generic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit, because of the
orthogonality catastrophe. However, for certain interacting systems (e.g.

snapshot space and a local spectral decomposition in the snapshot space.
Previous research in developing multiscale spaces within GMsFEM focused on
constructing multiscale spaces and relevant ingredients in space only. In this
paper, our main objective is to develop a multiscale model reduction framework
within GMsFEM that uses space-time coarse cells. We construct space-time
snapshot and offline spaces. We compute these snapshot solutions by solving
local problems. A complete snapshot space will use all possible boundary
conditions; however, this can be very expensive. We propose using randomized
boundary conditions and oversampling. We construct the local spectral
decomposition based on our analysis, as presented in the paper. We present
numerical results to confirm our theoretical findings and to show that using
our proposed approaches, we can obtain an accurate solution with low
dimensional coarse spaces. We remark that the proposed method is a significant
extension compared to existing methods, which use coarse cells in space only

stratified, rotating shear flow (as in protoplanetary disks), causing them to
generate vortex layers, which roll-up into anticyclonic zombie vortices and
cyclonic vortex sheets. The process is self-sustaining as zombie vortices
perturb new critical layers, spawning a next generation of zombie vortices.
Here, we focus on two issues: the minimum threshold of perturbations that
trigger self-sustaining vortex generation, and the properties of the late-time
zombie turbulence on large and small scales. The critical parameter that
determines whether ZVI is triggered is the magnitude of the vorticity on the
small scales (and not velocity), the minimum Rossby number needed for
instability is $Ro_{crit}\sim0.2$ for $\beta\equiv N/\Omega = 2$, where $N$ is
the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency. While the threshold is set by vorticity, it
is useful to infer a criterion on the Mach number, for Kolmogorov noise, the
critical Mach number scales with Reynolds number: $Ma_{crit}\sim
Ro_{crit}Re^{-1/2}$. In protoplanetary disks, this is $Ma_{crit}\sim10^{-6}$.
On large scales, zombie turbulence is characterized by anticyclones and
cyclonic sheets with typical Rossby number $\sim$0.3. The spacing of the
cyclonic sheets and anticyclones appears to have a ""memory"" of the spacing of
the critical layers. On the small scales, zombie turbulence has no memory of
the initial conditions and has a Kolmogorov-like energy spectrum. While our
earlier work was in the limit of uniform stratification, we have demonstrated
that ZVI works for non-uniform Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency profiles that may
be found in protoplanetary disks.

explain the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetar giant flares,
since they do not suffer from the additional damping mechanism due to phase
mixing, contrary to what happens for continuum oscillations. However, we cannot
prove rigorously that the coherent oscillations with constant phase are normal

dimensions is its connection to algebraic geometry. Since every compact Riemann
surface is a projective algebraic curve, many constructions of interest in
physics (which a priori depend on the analytic structure of the spacetime) can
be formulated in purely algebraic language. This opens the door to interesting
generalizations, obtained by taking another choice of field: for instance, the
$p$-adics. We generalize the AdS/CFT correspondence according to this
principle; the result is a formulation of holography in which the bulk geometry
is discrete---the Bruhat--Tits tree for $\mathrm{PGL}(2,\mathbb{Q}_p)$---but
the group of bulk isometries nonetheless agrees with that of boundary conformal
transformations and is not broken by discretization. We suggest that this forms
the natural geometric setting for tensor networks that have been proposed as
models of bulk reconstruction via quantum error correcting codes; in certain
cases, geodesics in the Bruhat--Tits tree reproduce those constructed using
quantum error correction. Other aspects of holography also hold: Standard
holographic results for massive free scalar fields in a fixed background carry
over to the tree, whose vertical direction can be interpreted as a
renormalization-group scale for modes in the boundary CFT. Higher-genus bulk
geometries (the BTZ black hole and its generalizations) can be understood
straightforwardly in our setting, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the

46-pointing mosaic(D-array, C-Band (4-8GHz)) JVLA observation using realistic
brightness distribution ranging from $1\mu$Jy to $100m$Jy and time-,frequency-,

from these comparisons are (a) errors in the reconstructed intensities and
spectral indices are larger for weaker sources even in the absence of simulated

networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals. These

any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed
by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers. In
experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard
residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby
demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the
success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks. Rather, the key may be
the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep.
We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a
natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in
fractal architectures. Such regularization allows extraction of
high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks. Additionally, fractal networks
exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while
deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer.

This is done using the framework of Bloch theory to describe the dark states

actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial

many cooks spoil the broth' where additional contributions are discounted, or
`two heads are better than one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the

ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the
evolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes
became experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. Here we analyse
the evolutionary dynamics of non-linear social dilemmas in settings where the

hardware impairments is the most effective and attractive way for
cost-efficient applications concerning massive MIMO systems. In this context,
the impact of channel aging, which severely affects the performance, is
investigated herein by considering a generalized model. Specifically, we show
that both Doppler shift because of the users' relative movement as well as
phase noise due to noisy local oscillators (LOs) contribute to channel aging.
To this end, we first propose a joint model, encompassing both effects, in
order to investigate the performance of a massive MIMO system based on the
inevitable time-varying nature of realistic mobile communications. Then, we
derive the deterministic equivalents (DEs) for the
signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SINRs) with maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) and regularized zero-forcing precoding (RZF). Our analysis not only
demonstrates a performance comparison between MRT and RZF under these
conditions, but most importantly, it reveals interesting properties regarding
the effects of user mobility and phase noise. In particular, the large antenna
limit behavior depends profoundly on both effects, but the burden due to user
mobility is much more detrimental than phase noise even for moderate user
velocities ($\approx30$ km/h), while the negative impact of phase noise is
noteworthy at lower mobility conditions.

fraction of fevers that are attributable to malaria, the malaria attributable
fever fraction (MAFF), is an important public health measure for assessing the
effect of malaria control programs and other purposes. Estimating the MAFF is
not straightforward because there is no gold standard diagnosis of a malaria
attributable fever; an individual can have malaria parasites in her blood and a
fever, but the individual may have developed partial immunity that allows her
to tolerate the parasites and the fever is being caused by another infection.
We define the MAFF using the potential outcome framework for causal inference
and show what assumptions underlie current estimation methods. Current
estimation methods rely on an assumption that the parasite density is correctly
measured. However, this assumption does not generally hold because (i) fever
kills some parasites and (ii) the measurement of parasite density has
measurement error. In the presence of these problems, we show current
estimation methods do not perform well. We propose a novel maximum likelihood
estimation method based on exponential family g-modeling. Under the assumption
that the measurement error mechanism and the magnitude of the fever killing
effect are known, we show that our proposed method provides approximately
unbiased estimates of the MAFF in simulation studies. A sensitivity analysis
can be used to assess the impact of different magnitudes of fever killing and
different measurement error mechanisms. We apply our proposed method to

the difference quotient of the function's increment and the difference of its
argument raised to a fractional power. A relationship to the point-wise
H\""older exponent of a function, its point-wise oscillation and the existence
of fractional velocity is established. It is demonstrated that wherever the
fractional velocity of non-integral order is continuous then it vanishes. The
work further demonstrates the use of fractional velocity as a tool for
characterization of the discontinuity set of the derivatives of functions thus
providing a natural characterization of strongly non-linear local behavior.
Finally the equivalence with the Kolwankar-Gangal local fractional derivative

generic step for cell activation. However, this step relies on rare events
where stochastic particles located in a large bulk are searching for small and
often hidden targets and thus remains difficult to study. We present here a
hybrid discrete-continuum model where the large ensemble of particles is
described by mass-action laws. The rare discrete binding events are modeled by
a Markov chain for the encounter of a finite number of small targets by few
Brownian particles, for which the arrival time is Poissonian. This model is
applied for predicting the time distribution of vesicular release at neuronal
synapses that remains elusive. This release is triggered by the binding of few
calcium ions that can originate either from the synaptic bulk or from the
transient entry through calcium channels. We report that the distribution of
release time is bimodal although triggered by a single fast action potential:
while the first peak follows a stimulation, the second corresponds to the
random arrival over much longer time of ions located in the bulk to small
binding targets. To conclude, the present multiscale stochastic chemical
reaction modeling allows studying cellular events based on integrating discrete
molecular events over various time scales.

been a analyzed recently for hard X-rays data only. Since in a typical flare
the same accelerated electron population is believed to produce both hard
X-rays and gyrosynchrotron, we compare both time profiles searching for
intermittency signatures. For that we define a cross-wavelet power spectrum,
that is used to obtain the Local Intermittency Measure or LIM. When greater
than three, the square LIM coefficients indicate a local intermittent process.
The LIM$^2$ coefficient distribution in time and scale helps to identify
avalanche or cascade energy release processes. We find two different and well
separated intermittent behaviors in the submillimeter data: for scales greater
than 20 s, a broad distribution during the rising and maximum phases of the
emission seems to favor a cascade process; for scales below 1 s, short pulses
centered on the peak time, are representative of avalanches. When applying the
same analysis to hard X-rays, we find only the scales above 10 s producing a
distribution related to a cascade energy fragmentation. Our results suggest
that different acceleration mechanisms are responsible for tens of keV and MeV
energy ranges of electrons.

then the Fisher information matrix for estimating the desired vector parameter
is singular, and moreover, there exist infinitely many nonidentifiable vector
parameter points in the vector parameter space. Furthermore, it is shown that
under some common assumptions on the statistical models of the observations and

networks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling
layers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to
predictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has
attempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or
MRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between
objects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these
problems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The
downside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than
traditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.
  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk
Network (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and
spatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.
Our proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and
semantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk
layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the
network. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix
multiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks
and it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard
back-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional
parameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces
an improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.

resistivity behaves as $\rho=\rho_0+AT^2$ around 120 K, the $A$ value decreases

by Rh $4d$ electrons with extended orbitals. We find that, in contrast to such
a weak correlation effect observed in the resistivity of Rh-substituted
samples, the low-temperature Seebeck coefficient is increased with increasing
Rh content, which is explained with a possible enhancement of a pseudogap
associated with the short-range order of spin density wave. In high-temperature
range above room temperature, we show that the resistivity is largely
suppressed by Rh substitution while the Seebeck coefficient becomes almost
temperature-independent, leading to a significant improvement of the power
factor in Rh-substituted samples. This result is also discussed in terms of the

complex plane, configurations of vector spaces or modules indexed by complex
numbers and collections of Jordan cells. The first are refinements of Betti

discussed in this paper but discussed in works this report is based on, these

implementable algorithms when the source of the map is a simplicial complex and
the map is simplicial) and are of relevance for the dynamics of flows which

can stay together after reproduction. They reach complexes of a certain size,
n, before producing single cells again. The cells within a complex derive
payoff from an evolutionary game by interacting with each other. The
reproductive rate of cells is proportional to their payoff. We consider all
two-strategy games. We study deterministic evolutionary dynamics with
mutations, and derive exact conditions for selection to favor one strategy over
another. Our main result has the same symmetry as the well-known sigma
condition, which has been proven for stochastic game dynamics and weak
selection. For a maximum complex size of n=2 our result holds for any intensity
of selection. For n > 2 it holds for weak selection. As specific examples we
study the prisoner's dilemma and hawk-dove games. Our model advances
theoretical work on multicellularity by allowing for frequency-dependent

signals of climate change during recent decades. Comprehensive climate models
have struggled to reproduce this, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice
retreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to
have decreased in models participating in the most recent phase of the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of
models (CMIP3). Here we examine simulations from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. We find
that simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing,
which was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the
CMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the
1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979-2013
global-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than
observed. We show that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of
Arctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to
the observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an
approximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean
surface temperature. We find that both generations of climate models simulate
Arctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has
been observed. The results imply that the much of the difference in Arctic sea
ice trends between CMIP3 and CMIP5 occurred due to the inclusion of volcanic
forcing, rather than improved sea ice physics or model resolution.

low descriptiveness and interpretability of those hand-crafted aesthetic
criteria (i.e., nonindicative of region-level aesthetics), and 2) the
difficulty of engineering aesthetic features adaptively and automatically
toward different image sets. To remedy these problems, we develop a deep
architecture to learn aesthetically-relevant visual attributes from Flickr1,
which are localized by multiple textual attributes in a weakly-supervised
setting. More specifically, using a bag-ofwords (BoW) representation of the
frequent Flickr image tags, a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm discovers
a compact set of textual attributes (e.g., landscape and sunset) for each
image. Then, a weakly-supervised learning algorithm projects the textual
attributes at image-level to the highly-responsive image patches at
pixel-level. These patches indicate where humans look at appealing regions with
respect to each textual attribute, which are employed to learn the visual
attributes. Psychological and anatomical studies have shown that humans
perceive visual concepts hierarchically. Hence, we normalize these patches and
feed them into a five-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to mimick the
hierarchy of human perceiving the visual attributes. We apply the learned deep
features on image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval. Both
subjective and objective experimental results thoroughly demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach.

in the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded as
reward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewards
provide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal,
or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback,
agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking
intentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning
purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by
constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification
of purposes that are ""just out of reach"" of the agent's current behaviour.
These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately
resulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different
parts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for
settings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the
exploration of the environment until reward is observed.

immediate consequence of earlier work [G1, GPS1, GPS2] is that the open-closed

hypothesis: the 0th Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{A}$
$\mathrm{HH}^0(\mathcal{A})$ should have sufficiently large rank: $\mathrm{rk}\

Perutz and Sheridan [GPS2] and by Abouzaid-Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono [AFO+]; a proof
in the simplest settings appears here in an Appendix. Because categories Morita
equivalent to categories of coherent sheaves or matrix factorizations are
homologically smooth, our result applies to resolve the split-generation

(generalizing a result of Perutz-Sheridan [PS2] proven in the case $c_1(X) =

tube with two glass rods at two ends as the optical media. The length of the
middle vacuum cell is L and the thicknesses of the glass rods with refractive
index n are D1 and D2. The light drag effect of the moving vacuum tube with
speed v is a first-order effect, delta t = 2(n-1)(D1+D2)v/c^2, which is
independent of L because vacuum does not perform a drag effect. Predicted by
the principle of relativity, the change of the light propagation time interval
with stationary vacuum tube and moving source and receiver must be the same,
i.e., delta tao = delta t = 2(n-1)(D1+D2)v/c^2. However all analyses have shown
that the change of the propagation time interval delta tao is caused by the
motion of the receiver during the light propagation in the vacuum tube. Thus,
the contribution of the glass rods in delta tao is 2n(D1+D2)v/c^2, not
2(n-1)(D1+D2)v/c^2 in delta t. Importantly, the contribution of the vacuum cell
in delta tao is 2Lv/c^2, not zero in delta t. Our analyses are solid in optics.
The genuine tests of the prediction of the principle of relativity can be
conducted by the experiments with two atomic clocks, or the experiments with
fiber Sagnac interferometers.

computational fluid dynamics method that utilizes a Riemann solver and achieves
the second-order accuracy in space. In this paper, we extend the Godunov SPH
method to elastic dynamics by incorporating deviatoric stress tensor that
represents the stress for shear deformation or anisotropic compression.
Analogously to the formulation of the original Godunov SPH method, we formulate
the equation of motion, the equation of energy, and the time evolution equation
of deviatoric stress tensor so that the resulting discretized system achieves
the second-order accuracy in space. The standard SPH method tends to suffer
from the tensile instability that results in unphysical clustering of particles
especially in tension-dominated region. We find that the tensile instability
can be suppressed by selecting appropriate interpolation for density
distribution in the equation of motion for the Godunov SPH method even in the
case of elastic dynamics. Several test calculations for elastic dynamics are
performed, and the accuracy and versatility of the present method are shown.

the most numerous consumer robots in existence today. While early versions
employed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the major
manufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placed
beacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visual
sensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or only
providing a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beacon
placement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present a
passive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at night
that combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolution
contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in
two-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventional
low light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn and
in a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2D
localization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varying
odometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length.
Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it can
enable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonless
sky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply all
conventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights.

demagnetization for a ferromagnet, where ferromagnetic domains are randomized

decreasing amplitude, resembling field demagnetization for the ferromagnet. The

The central idea of our approach is deep fusion, i.e., combine the intermediate
representations of base networks, where the fused output serves as the input of
the remaining part of each base network, and perform such combinations deeply
over several intermediate representations. The resulting deeply fused net
enjoys several benefits. First, it is able to learn multi-scale representations
as it enjoys the benefits of more base networks, which could form the same
fused network, other than the initial group of base networks. Second, in our
suggested fused net formed by one deep and one shallow base networks, the flows
of the information from the earlier intermediate layer of the deep base network
to the output and from the input to the later intermediate layer of the deep
base network are both improved. Last, the deep and shallow base networks are
jointly learnt and can benefit from each other. More interestingly, the
essential depth of a fused net composed from a deep base network and a shallow
base network is reduced because the fused net could be composed from a less
deep base network, and thus training the fused net is less difficult than
training the initial deep base network. Empirical results demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior performance over two closely-related methods, ResNet
and Highway, and competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts.

be present in significant amounts in the mantle. However, its long-term cycling
between these two reservoirs remains poorly understood. Here a range of biotic
and abiotic mechanisms are evaluated that could have caused nitrogen exchange
between Earth's surface and interior over time. In the Archean, biological
nitrogen fixation was likely strongly limited by nutrient and/or electron
acceptor constraints. Abiotic fixation of dinitrogen becomes efficient in
strongly reducing atmospheres, but only once temperatures exceed around 1000 K.
Hence if atmospheric N2 levels really were as low as they are today 3.0 - 3.5
Ga, the bulk of Earth's mantle nitrogen must have been emplaced in the Hadean,
most likely at a time when the surface was molten. The elevated atmospheric N
content on Venus compared to Earth can be explained abiotically by a water loss
redox pump mechanism, where oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis and subsequent
H loss to space oxidises the mantle, causing enhanced outgassing of nitrogen.
This mechanism has implications for understanding the partitioning of other
Venusian volatiles and atmospheric evolution on exoplanets.

function. In comparison with existing nonconvex Wirtinger flow (WF) algorithm
\cite{candes2015phase}, although the loss function becomes nonsmooth, it
involves only the second power of variable and hence reduces the complexity. We
show that for random Gaussian measurements, RWF enjoys geometric convergence to
a global optimal point as long as the number $m$ of measurements is on the
order of $n$, the dimension of the unknown $\boldsymbol{x}$. This improves the
sample complexity of WF, and achieves the same sample complexity as truncated
Wirtinger flow (TWF) \cite{chen2015solving}, but without truncation in gradient
loop. Furthermore, RWF costs less computationally than WF, and runs faster
numerically than both WF and TWF. We further develop the incremental

linearly to the true signal. We further establish performance guarantee of an

functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are
noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training
set labeling process as a generative model, we can ""denoise"" the generated

these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a

learning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting. However, both methods
require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector,
which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word
representations. We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the
text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent
neural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed method
achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and
purely supervised tasks. We provide visualizations and analysis showing that
the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training,
the model is less prone to overfitting. Code is available at

incompatible donors. In the last decade, kidney exchanges grew from small and

in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors.
State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear
fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models
and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this
paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be
encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing
problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary
compatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS
nationwide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encode
real compatibility graphs. The experiments show that, indeed, small numbers of
attributes suffice.

The tradeoff is characterized by the so-called fractional delivery time (FDT)

generic cooperative transmitter/receiver caching strategy with adjustable file
splitting ratios. Based on this caching strategy, we then design the delivery
phase carefully to turn the considered interference channel opportunistically
into broadcast channel, multicast channel, X channel, or a hybrid form of these
channels. After that, we obtain an achievable upper bound of the minimum FDT by
solving a linear programming problem of the file splitting ratios. The
achievable FDT is a convex and piece-wise linear decreasing function of the
cache sizes. Receiver local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and
transmitter cooperation gain (interference alignment and interference
neutralization) are leveraged in different cache size regions.

which is consisted of only several packets, and a few throughput-sensitive
""elephant"" flows, which occupy more than 80% of overall load. Generally, the
short-lived ""mice"" flows induce transient congestion and the long-lived
""elephant"" flows cause persistent congestion. The network congestion is a major
performance inhibitor. Conventionally, the hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow
control mechanisms are employed to relief transient and persistent congestion,
respectively. However, in face of the mixture of elephants and mice, we find
the hybrid congestion control scheme including hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow
control mechanisms suffers from serious performance impairments. As a step
further, our in-depth analysis reveals that the hybrid scheme performs poor at
latency of mice and throughput of elephant. Motivated by this understanding, we
argue for isolating mice and elephants in different queues, such that the
hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow control mechanisms are independently imposed to
short-lived and long-lived flows, respectively. Our solution is
readily-deployable and compatible with current commodity network devices and
can leverage various congestion control mechanisms. Extensive simulations show
that our proposal of isolation can simultaneously improve the latency of mice
by at least 30% and the link utilization to almost 100%.

DNNs to energy efficient neuromorphic chips the incompatibility between

neurons and synapses of neuromorphic chips has to be overcome. Previous work
has achieved this by training a network to learn continuous probabilities and
deployment to a neuromorphic architecture by random sampling these
probabilities. An ensemble of sampled networks is needed to approximate the
performance of the trained network.

directly learning binary synaptic crossbars. Results on MNIST show that better
performance can be achieved with a small network in one time step (92.7%

previous work, which translates into significantly decreased energy consumption
for both networks. Results of our work are stable since they do not require

stars is larger than that of main-sequence stars. Most hot stars rapidly rotate
around their stellar axes. The stellar rotation makes ellipticity and
gravity-darkening effects which break the spherical symmetry of the source
shape and the circular symmetry of the source surface brightness respectively.
Hence, it causes a net polarization signal for the source star. This
polarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast
rotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even
characterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through
polarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source
star makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing
curves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected
position of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a
time shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in
transit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry
curves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing
events. By measuring this time shift via polarimetry observations of
microlensing events, we can evaluate the ellipticity of the projected source
surface on the sky plane. Given the characterizations of the FOcal Reducer and
low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2) polarimeter at Very Large Telescope (VLT)
telescope, the probability of observing this time shift is so small. The more
accurate polarimeters of the next generation may likely measure these time
shifts and evaluate the ellipticity of microlensing source stars.

gradual trend to homogeneity, is a fundamental probe of density functional
theory, one that has driven recent advances in understanding both the kinetic
and exchange-correlation energies. Although research focus is normally upon the
scaling of energies, insights can also be gained from energy densities. We
visualize the scaling of the positive-definite kinetic energy density (KED) in
closed-shell atoms, in comparison to invariant quantities based upon the
gradient and Laplacian of the density. We notice a striking fit of the KED
within the core of any atom to a gradient expansion using both the gradient and
the Laplacian, appearing as an asymptotic limit around which the KED
oscillates. The gradient expansion is qualitatively different from that derived
from first principles for a slowly-varying electron gas and is correlated with
a nonzero Pauli contribution to the KED near the nucleus. We propose and
explore orbital-free meta-GGA models for the kinetic energy to describe these
features, with some success, but the effects of quantum oscillations in the
inner shells of atoms makes a complete parametrization difficult. We discuss
implications for improved orbital-free description of molecular properties.

although the prospect of reaching sub-percent accuracy in the measurement of

the sampling of parameter space, requires usage of a large number (hundreds in

few N-body simulations with a large number of realizations performed with
approximate methods gives the most promising approach to solve these problems
with a reasonable amount of resources. In this paper I review this topic,

carbonaceous solids detected in the interstellar medium. Energetic processing
of the a-C:H particles leads to the dissociation of the C-H bonds and the
formation of hydrogen molecules and small hydrocarbons. Photo-produced H2
molecules in the bulk of the dust particles can diffuse out to the gas phase
and contribute to the total H2 abundance. We have simulated this process in the
laboratory with plasma-produced a-C:H and a-C:D analogs under astrophysically
relevant conditions to investigate the dependence of the diffusion as a
function of temperature. Plasma-produced a-C:H analogs were UV-irradiated using
a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. Molecules diffusing to the gas-phase
were detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer, providing a measurement of the
outgoing H2 or D2 flux. By comparing the experimental measurements with the
expected flux from a one-dimensional diffusion model, a diffusion coefficient D
could be derived for experiments carried out at different temperatures.
Dependance on the diffusion coefficient D with the temperature followed an
Arrhenius-type equation. The activation energy for the diffusion process was
estimated (ED(H2)=1660+-110 K, ED(D2)=2090+-90 K), as well as the
pre-exponential factor (D0(H2)=0.0007+0.0013-0.0004 cm2 s-1,
D0(D2)=0.0045+0.005-0.0023 cm2 s-1) The strong decrease of the diffusion
coefficient at low dust particle temperatures exponentially increases the
diffusion times in astrophysical environments. Therefore, transient dust
heating by cosmic rays needs to be invoked for the release of the photo-
produced H2 molecules in cold PDR regions, where destruction of the aliphatic
component in hydrogenated amorphous carbons most probably takes place.

circuit U preparing a given boundary state from a trivial reference state. We
describe how this idea may be extended to determine the relationship between
the fluctuations of the bulk holographic geometry and the fluctuations of the
boundary low-energy subspace. In this way we obtain, for every quantum system,
an Einstein-like equation of motion for what might be interpreted as a bulk
gravity theory dual to the boundary system.

the inverse Noether theorem in the Hamiltonian form, obtain all the integrals

linearly independent recursion operators for symmetries of this system related
by a discrete symmetry of both the two-component system and its symmetry

obtain second and third Hamiltonian operators. However, we were not able to
find Hamiltonian densities corresponding to the latter two operators.
Therefore, we construct two recursion operators, which are either even or odd,
respectively, under the above-mentioned discrete symmetry. Acting with them on
$J_0$, we generate another two Hamiltonian operators $J_+$ and $J_-$ and find
the corresponding Hamiltonian densities, thus obtaining second and third
Hamiltonian representations for the first heavenly equation in a two-component

the linear combination of $J_0$, $J_+$ and $J_-$ with arbitrary constant
coefficients satisfies Jacobi identities. Since their skew symmetry is obvious,
these three operators are compatible Hamiltonian operators and hence we obtain
a tri-Hamiltonian representation of the first heavenly equation. Our
well-founded conjecture applied here is that P. Olver's method works fine for
nonlocal operators and our proof of the Jacobi identities and bi-Hamiltonian
structures crucially depends on the validity of this conjecture.

of them which has received much attention recently consists of those based on
""no-regret"" algorithms from the area of machine learning. It is known that
dynamics based on generic no-regret algorithms may not converge to Nash
equilibria in general, but to a larger set of outcomes, namely coarse
correlated equilibria. Moreover, convergence results based on generic no-regret
algorithms typically use a weaker notion of convergence: the convergence of the
average plays instead of the actual plays. Some work has been done showing that
when using a specific no-regret algorithm, the well-known multiplicative
updates algorithm, convergence of actual plays to equilibria can be shown and
better quality of outcomes in terms of the price of anarchy can be reached for
atomic congestion games and load balancing games. Are there more cases of
natural no-regret dynamics that perform well in suitable classes of games in
terms of convergence and quality of outcomes that the dynamics converge to?
  We answer this question positively in the bulletin-board model by showing
that when employing the mirror-descent algorithm, a well-known generic
no-regret algorithm, the actual plays converge quickly to equilibria in
nonatomic congestion games. Furthermore, the bandit model considers a probably
more realistic and prevalent setting with only partial information, in which at
each time step each player only knows the cost of her own currently played
strategy, but not any costs of unplayed strategies. For the class of atomic
congestion games, we propose a family of bandit algorithms based on the
mirror-descent algorithms previously presented, and show that when each player
individually adopts such a bandit algorithm, their joint (mixed) strategy
profile quickly converges with implications.

abundant CO isotopologues, whose detection is routine for ALMA, to infer the
gas mass of disks. Isotope-selective effects need to be taken into account in
the analysis, because they can significantly modify CO isotopologues line
intensities. CO isotope-selective photodissociation has been implemented in the
physical-chemical code DALI and 800 disk models have been run for a range of
disk and stellar parameters. Dust and gas temperature structures have been
computed self-consistently, together with a chemical calculation of the main
species. Both disk structure and stellar parameters have been investigated.
Total fluxes have been ray-traced for different CO isotopologues and for
various transitions for different inclinations. A combination of 13CO and C18O
total intensities allows inference of the total disk mass, although with
non-negligible uncertainties. These can be overcome by employing spatially
resolved observations, i.e. the disk's radial extent and inclination.
Comparison with parametric models shows differences at the factor of a few
level, especially for extremely low and high disk masses. Finally, total line
intensities for different CO isotopologue and for various low-J transitions are
provided and are fitted to simple formulae. The effects of a lower gas-phase
carbon abundance and different gas/dust ratios are investigated as well, and
comparison with other tracers is made. Disk masses can be determined within a
factor of a few by comparing CO isotopologue lines observations with the
simulated line fluxes, modulo the uncertainties in the volatile elemental
abundances.

misalign the components. The alignment process dominates in systems with

from this geometric viewpoint, we introduce and analyze a method which utilizes
the geometry of the SPD matrix manifold and the invariance properties of its

performed through shrinkage estimation in a transformed (e.g., wavelet) domain;
shrinkage in the transformed domain corresponds to smoothing in the original
domain. A key question in such applications is how much to shrink, or,
equivalently, how much to smooth. Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods provide an
attractive solution to this problem; they use the data to estimate a
distribution of underlying ""effects"", hence automatically select an appropriate
amount of shrinkage. However, most existing implementations of Empirical Bayes
shrinkage are less flexible than they could be--both in their assumptions on
the underlying distribution of effects, and in their ability to handle
heterskedasticity---which limits their signal denoising applications. Here we
address this by taking a particularly flexible, stable and computationally
convenient Empirical Bayes shrinkage method, and we apply it to several signal
denoising problems. These applications include smoothing of Poisson data and
heteroskedastic Gaussian data. We show through empirical comparisons that the
results are competitive with other methods, including both simple thresholding
rules and purpose-built Empirical Bayes procedures. Our methods are implemented
in the R package smashr, ""SMoothing by Adaptive SHrinkage in R,"" available at

sequences, and more in general for contraction activity, allowing to
distinguish e.g simultaneous from sequential reduction. Proof terms for
finitary, first-order, left-linear term rewriting are described in the Terese
book, chapter 8. In a previous work, we defined an extension of the finitary
proof-term formalism, that allows to describe contractions in infinitary
first-order term rewriting, and gave a characterisation of permutation
equivalence.
  In this work, we discuss how projections of possibly infinite rewrite
sequences can be modeled using proof terms. Again, the foundation is a
characterisation of projections for finitary rewriting described in Terese,
Section 8.7. We extend this characterisation to infinitary rewriting and also
refine it, by describing precisely the role that structural equivalence plays
in the development of the notion of projection. The characterisation we propose
yields a definite expression, i.e. a proof term, that describes the projection
of an infinitary reduction over another.
  To illustrate the working of projections, we show how a common reduct of a
(possibly infinite) reduction and a single step that makes part of it can be
obtained via their respective projections. We show, by means of several
examples, that the proposed definition yields the expected behavior also in
cases beyond those covered by this result. Finally, we discuss how the notion

aperiodicity (additive non periodic component) analysis, specifically intended
for high-quality speech synthesis and modification applications. The proposed
framework consists of three subsystems: instantaneous frequency estimator and
initial aperiodicity detector, F0 trajectory tracker, and F0 refinement and
aperiodicity extractor. A preliminary implementation of the proposed framework
substantially outperformed (by a factor of 10 in terms of RMS F0 estimation
error) existing F0 extractors in tracking ability of temporally varying F0
trajectories. The front end aperiodicity detector consists of a complex-valued
wavelet analysis filter with a highly selective temporal and spectral envelope.
This front end aperiodicity detector uses a new measure that quantifies the
deviation from periodicity. The measure is less sensitive to slow FM and AM and
closely correlates with the signal to noise ratio.

important nuclear cross sections for astrophysics have long been identified
e.g. 12C(alpha,gamma)16O for stellar evolution, or 13C(alpha,n)16O and
22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg as neutron sources for the s-process. More recently,
observations of lithium abundances in the oldest stars, or of nuclear gamma-ray
lines from space, have required new laboratory experiments. New evaluation of
thermonuclear reaction rates now includes the associated rate uncertainties
that are used in astrophysical models to i) estimate final uncertainties on
nucleosynthesis yields and ii) identify those reactions that require further
experimental investigation. Sometimes direct cross section measurements are
possible, but more generally the use of indirect methods is compulsory in view
of the very low cross sections. Non-thermal processes are often overlooked but
are also important for nuclear astrophysics, e.g. in gamma-ray emission from
solar flares or in the interaction of cosmic rays with matter, and also
motivate laboratory experiments. Finally, we show that beyond the historical
motivations of nuclear astrophysics, understanding i) the energy sources that
drive stellar evolution and ii) the origin of the elements can also be used to
give new insights into physics beyond the standard model.

choosing a PDE solver is cast as a problem in the Bayesian design of
experiments, where the aim is to minimise the impact of solver error on
statistical inferences; here the challenge of non-linear PDEs is also
considered. The method is applied to parameter inference problems in which
discretisation error in non-negligible and must be accounted for in order to

coherence, whose information-theoretic characterization is currently under
investigation. Under the resource theory of coherence, it is interesting to
investigate interpretations of coherence measures and the interplay with other
quantum properties, such as quantum correlations and intrinsic randomness.
Coherence can be viewed as the resource for the intrinsic randomness in the
measurement outcomes of a state in the computational basis. We observed in our
previous work that the coherence of formation, which measures the asymptotic
coherence dilution rate, indeed quantifies the uncertainty of a (classical)
correlated party about the system measurement outcome. In this work, we
re-derive the result from a quantum point of view and then connect the
intrinsic randomness to the relative entropy of coherence, another important
coherence measure that quantifies the asymptotic distillable coherence. Even
though there does not exist bound coherent states, these two intrinsic
randomness quantified by coherence of formation and the relative entropy of
coherence are different. Interestingly, we show that this gap is equal to the
quantum discord, a general form of quantum correlations, in the state of the
system of interest and the correlated party, after a local measurement on the

strong equivalence principle violation. After our analysis we estimated
$\sigma[\eta]\lessapprox 4.5\times 10^{-5}$ which is about 1~order of magnitude
larger than the ""ideal"" case where masses of planets and asteroids have no

surface of 67P (Goesmann et al. 2015), raising questions concerning the
chemical origin of such species (cloud or inheritance versus disk synthesis).
Results from an astrochemical model of a protoplanetary disk are presented in
which complex chemistry is included and in which it is assumed that simple ices
only are inherited from the parent molecular cloud. The model results show good
agreement with the abundances of several COMs observed on the surface of 67P
with Philae/COSAC. Cosmic-ray and X-ray-induced photoprocessing of
predominantly simple ices inherited by the protoplanetary disk is sufficient to
generate a chemical complexity similar to that observed in comets. This
indicates that the icy COMs detected on the surface of 67P may have a disk
origin. The results also show that gas-phase CH3CN is abundant in the inner
warm disk atmosphere where hot gas-phase chemistry dominates and potentially
erases the ice chemical signature. Hence, CH3CN may not be an unambiguous
tracer of the complex organic ice reservoir. However, a better understanding of
the hot gas-phase chemistry of CH3CN is needed to confirm this preliminary

than the class of models that can be printed using additive manufacturing
technologies. Stated differently, there exist well-formed STL files that cannot
be printed. In this paper such a gap is formalized and a fully automatic
procedure is described to turn any such file into a printable model.
  Approach: Based on well-established concepts from combinatorial topology, we
provide an unambiguous description of all the mathematical entities involved in
the modeling-printing pipeline. Specifically, we formally define the conditions
that an STL file must satisfy to be printable and, based on these, we design an
as-exact-as-possible repairing algorithm.
  Findings: We have found that, in order to cope with all the possible triangle
configurations, the algorithm must distinguish between triangles that bound
solid parts and triangles that constitute zero-thickness sheets. Only the
former set can be fixed without distortion.
  Originality: Previous methods that are guaranteed to fix all the possible
configurations provide only approximate solutions with an unnecessary
distortion. Conversely, our procedure is as exact as possible, meaning that no
visible distortion is introduced unless it is strictly imposed by limitations
of the printing device. Thanks to such an unprecedented flexibility and
accuracy, this algorithm is expected to significantly simplify the
modeling-printing process, in particular within the continuously emerging
non-professional ""maker"" communities.

practitioners due to its efficiency and easiness of interpretation. However,
for high-dimensional models the direct application of this method can be very
time consuming and prohibitively expensive to use. One of the alternative
global sensitivity analysis methods known as the method of derivative based
global sensitivity measures (DGSM) has recently become popular among
practitioners. It has a link with the Morris screening method and Sobol
sensitivity indices. DGSM are very easy to implement and evaluate numerically.
The computational time required for numerical evaluation of DGSM is generally
much lower than that for estimation of Sobol sensitivity indices. We present a
survey of recent advances in DGSM and new results concerning new lower and
upper bounds on the values of Sobol total sensitivity indices. Using these
bounds it is possible in most cases to get a good practical estimation of the
values of Sobol total sensitivity indices. Several examples are used to
illustrate an application of DGSM.

complete theory of the orbital states of Ge donor electrons, and use it to show
that Ge could have significant advantages over silicon in the implementation of
a donor-based quantum processor architecture. We show that the stronger
spin-orbit interaction and the larger electron donor wave functions for Ge
donors allow for greater tuning of the single qubit energy than for those in Si
crystals, thus enabling a large speedup of selective (local) quantum gates.
Further, exchange coupling between neighboring donor qubits is shown to be much
larger in Ge than in Si, and we show that this greatly relaxes the precision in
donor placement needed for robust two-qubit gates. To do this we compare two
statistical distributions for Ge:P and Si:P pair couplings, corresponding to
realistic donor implantation misplacement, and find that the spin couplings in
Ge:P have a $33\%$ chance of being within an order of magnitude of the largest
coupling, compared with only $10\%$ for the Si:P donors. This allows fast,
parallel and robust architectures for quantum computing with donors in Ge.

an antidirected path, while one can decide in linear time whether they are
connected by an antidirected trail. A digraph $D$ is antistrong if it contains
an antidirected $(x,y)$-trail starting and ending with a forward arc for every

by comparison with SDSS photometry a decade earlier, and then monitored with
the Liverpool Telescope, and studied spectroscopically with the William
Herschel Telescope (WHT). Based on colours, light curve shape, and spectra,
these transients fall into four groups. A few are misclassified stars or
objects of unknown type. Some are red/fast transients and are known or likely
nuclear supernovae. A few are either radio sources or erratic variables and so
likely blazars. However the majority (~66%) are blue and evolve slowly, on a
timescale of years. Spectroscopy shows them to be AGN at z~ 0.3 - 1.4, which
must have brightened since the SDSS photometry by around an order of magnitude.
It is likely that these objects were in fact AGN a decade ago, but too weak to
be recognised by SDSS; they could then be classed as ""hypervariable"" AGN. By
searching the SDSS Stripe 82 quasar database, we find 15 similar objects. We
discuss several possible explanations for these slow blue hypervariables - (i)
unusually luminous tidal disruption events; (ii) extinction events; (iii)
changes in accretion state; and (iv) large amplitude microlensing by stars in
foreground galaxies. A mixture of explanations (iii) and (iv) seems most
likely. Both hold promise of considerable new insight into the AGN phenomenon.

spatial resolution using JHKs-band images obtained with the GeMS/GSAOI
instrument on the Gemini South telescope. The typical angular resolution of the
images is of 100 mas, with a limiting magnitude in H of 22 mag (90 percent
completeness). Photometry from our images is used to identify candidate young
stellar objects (YSOs) in N159W. We also determine the H-band luminosity
function of the star cluster at the centre of the H II region and use this to
estimate its initial mass function (IMF).
  Results. We estimate an age of 2 + or - 1 Myr for the central cluster, with
its IMF described by a power-law with an index of gamma = - 1.05 + or - 0.2 ,
and with a total estimated mass of 1300 solar mass. We also identify 104
candidate YSOs, which are concentrated in clumps and subclusters of stars,
principally at the edges of the H II region. These clusters display signs of
recent and active star-formation such as ultra-compact H II regions, and
molecular outflows. This suggests that the YSOs are typically younger than the
central cluster, pointing to sequential star-formation in N159W, which has
probably been influenced by interactions with the expanding H II bubble.

established technique in optical microscopy to increase the contrast of weakly

this paper we study the spiral phase plate (SPP), also called helical, vortex,
or two-dimensional Hilbert phase plate, that adds an angularly dependent phase
of the form $e^{i\ell\phi}$ to the exit wave in Fourier space. In the limit of
large collection angles, we analytically calculate that the average of a pair
of $\ell=\pm1$ SPP images is directly proportional to the gradient squared of
the exit wave, explaining the edge contrast previously seen in optical SPP
work. The difference between a clockwise-anticlockwise pair of SPP images and
conditions where this difference vanishes and the gradient of the exit wave can
be seen from one single SPP image, are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate how
with three images, one without and one with each of an $\ell=\pm1$ SPP, may
give enough information to reconstruct both the amplitude and the phase of the
exit wave. This work provides the theoretical background to interpret images
obtained with a SPP and can help enable new experiments to study for example
magnetic materials in an electron microscope.

system triggered by an independent symmetry-breaking quantum phase transition
in gauge/gravity duality. The gravity dual is an Einstein-scalar-dilaton system
with AdS near-boundary behavior and soft wall interior at zero scalar
condensate. We study the cases of neutral and charged condensate separately. In
the former case the condensation breaks the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
while a charged condensate breaks the continuous $U(1)$ symmetry. After the
condensation of the order parameter, the non-zero vacuum expectation value of
the scalar couples to the dilaton, changing the soft wall geometry into a
non-confining and anisotropically scale-invariant infrared metric. In other
words, the formation of long-range order is immediately followed by the
deconfinement transition and the two critical points coincide. The confined
phase has a scale -- the confinement scale (energy gap) which vanishes in the
deconfined case. Therefore, the breaking of the symmetry of the scalar
($\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$) in turn restores the scaling symmetry in the system
and neither phase has a higher overall symmetry than the other. When the scalar
is charged the phase transition is continuous which goes against the
Ginzburg-Landau theory where such transitions generically only occur
discontinuously. This phenomenon has some commonalities with the scenario of
deconfined criticality. The mechanism we have found has applications mainly in
effective field theories such as quantum magnetic systems. We briefly discuss
these applications and the relation to real-world systems.

discrete-variable central limit theorem. In this discrete EPI, the geometric
distribution, which has the maximum entropy among all discrete distributions
with a given mean, assumes a role analogous to the Gaussian distribution in
Shannon's EPI. The entropy power of $X$ is defined as the mean of a geometric
random variable with entropy $H(X)$. The crux of our construction is a
discrete-variable version of Lieb's scaled addition $X \boxplus_\eta Y$ of two
discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with $\eta \in (0, 1)$. We discuss the
relationship of our discrete EPI with recent work of Yu and Johnson who
developed an EPI for a restricted class of random variables that have
ultra-log-concave (ULC) distributions. Even though we leave open the proof of
the aforesaid natural form of the discrete EPI, we show that this discrete EPI
holds true for variables with arbitrary discrete distributions when the entropy
power is redefined as $e^{H(X)}$ in analogy with the continuous version.
Finally, we show that our conjectured discrete EPI is a special case of the
yet-unproven Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI), which assumes a role
analogous to Shannon's EPI in capacity proofs for Gaussian bosonic (quantum)

enhance the topological state, since for moderate values the transition from
the non-trivial topological to the trivial Mott insulator is pushed to larger

also found on honeycomb ribbons. With inversion symmetry, the edge of the
zigzag ribbon is magnetic for any value of $U$. This magnetic moment destroys
the gapless edge mode. Lifting inversion symmetry allows for a finite region in
interaction strength $U$ below which gapless edge modes exist.

evidence in a dynamic network has recently grown in importance. This problem
has relevance in signal and data fusion network applications and in studying
opinion and consensus dynamics in social networks. Due to its capability of
handling a wider variety of uncertainties and ambiguities associated with
evidence, we use the framework of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to capture the
opinion of an agent. We then examine the consensus among agents in dynamic
networks in which an agent can utilize either a cautious or receptive updating
strategy. In particular, we examine the case of bounded confidence updating
where an agent exchanges its opinion only with neighboring nodes possessing
'similar' evidence. In a fusion network, this captures the case in which nodes
only update their state based on evidence consistent with the node's own
evidence. In opinion dynamics, this captures the notions of Social Judgment
Theory (SJT) in which agents update their opinions only with other agents
possessing opinions closer to their own. Focusing on the two special DS
theoretic cases where an agent state is modeled as a Dirichlet body of evidence
and a probability mass function (p.m.f.), we utilize results from matrix
theory, graph theory, and networks to prove the existence of consensus agent
states in several time-varying network cases of interest. For example, we show
the existence of a consensus in which a subset of network nodes achieves a
consensus that is adopted by follower network nodes. Of particular interest is
the case of multiple opinion leaders, where we show that the agents do not
reach a consensus in general, but rather converge to 'opinion clusters'.

recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The
idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a
learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis.
Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both
precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary
learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel
regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation
(GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can
simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary
size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the
non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are
presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with
other state-of-the-art approaches.

of the CFT, equal to 1/4G times the area of the d-dimensional minimal surface

which is related to the boundary CFT according to Rehren's 1999 algebraic
holography theorem, the entanglement entropy between two complementary bulk
Rehren wedges is equal to 1/4G times the (suitably cut off) area of their

complementary ball-shaped regions, the RT minimal surface is precisely the
shared ridge of the complementary bulk Rehren wedges which correspond, under
Rehren's bulk-wedge to boundary double-cone bijection, to the complementary
boundary double-cones whose bases are the RT complementary balls.) This is
consistent with the Bianchi-Meyers conjecture -- that, in a theory of quantum
gravity, the entanglement entropy, S, between the degrees of freedom of a given

ranges from $\sim$200 to 550 minutes for ions, from $\sim$90 to 160 minutes for
low-energy electrons, and from $\sim$10 to 30 minutes for high-energy
electrons. Most of the selected events have no reported H$\alpha$ flares or

jet at 20S (the SEBs) on the southern edge of the South Equatorial Belt. The
wave has been identified in both reflected sunlight from amateur observations
between 2010 and 2015, thermal infrared imaging from the Very Large Telescope
and near infrared imaging from the Infrared Telescope Facility. The wave
pattern is present when the SEB is relatively quiescent and lacking large-scale
disturbances, and is particularly notable when the belt has undergone a fade
(whitening). It is generally not present when the SEB exhibits its usual
large-scale convective activity ('rifts'). Tracking of the wave pattern and
associated white ovals on its southern edge over several epochs have permitted
a measure of the dispersion relationship, showing a strong correlation between
the phase speed (-43.2 to -21.2 m/s) and the longitudinal wavelength, which
varied from 4.4-10.0 deg. longitude over the course of the observations.
Infrared imaging sensing low pressures in the upper troposphere suggest that
the wave is confined to near the cloud tops. The wave is moving westward at a
phase speed slower (i.e., less negative) than the peak retrograde wind speed
(-62 m/s), and is therefore moving east with respect to the SEBs jet peak.
Unlike the retrograde NEBn jet near 17N, which is a location of strong vertical
wind shear that sometimes hosts Rossby wave activity, the SEBs jet remains
retrograde throughout the upper troposphere, suggesting the SEBs pattern cannot
be interpreted as a classical Rossby wave. Cassini-derived windspeeds and
temperatures reveal that the vorticity gradient is dominated by the baroclinic
term and becomes negative (changes sign) in a region near the cloud-top level
(400-700 mbar) associated with the SEBs, suggesting a baroclinic origin for
this meandering wave pattern. [Abr]

anticoincidence prevented the detection of a large fraction of Terrestrial
Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs). The configuration change was highly successful
resulting in an increase of one order of magnitude in TGF detection rate. As
expected, the largest fraction of the new events has short duration ($< 100
\mathrm {\mu s}$), and part of them has simultaneous association with lightning
sferics detected by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The new
configuration provides the largest TGF detection rate surface density
(TGFs/$\mathrm{km^2}$/year) to date, opening prospects for improved correlation
studies with lightning and atmospheric parameters on short spatial and temporal
scales along the equatorial region.

employing the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that has
been shown to reasonably describe the charm dynamics at RHIC and LHC energies
on a microscopic level. In this approach the initial heavy quarks are produced
by using the PYTHIA which is tuned to reproduce the FONLL calculations. The
produced heavy quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in QGP with
scattering cross sections which are calculated in the dynamical quasi-particle
model (DQPM). At energy densities close to the critical energy density the
heavy quarks are hadronized into heavy mesons through either coalescence or
fragmentation. After hadronization the heavy mesons interact with the light
hadrons by employing the scattering cross sections from an effective
Lagrangian. The final heavy mesons then produce single electrons through
semileptonic decay. We find that the PHSD approach well describes the nuclear
modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ of single electrons in
d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 200 GeV and the elliptic flow
in Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV from the PHENIX

$\phi$ between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark is studied. We find that the
transverse flow enhances the azimuthal angular distributions close to $\phi=$ 0
because the heavy flavors strongly interact with nuclear medium in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions and almost flow with the bulk matter.

Therefore, these approaches are not suitable for safety-critical and hard

  In this paper the focus is on the real-time communication analysis for
wormhole-switched priority-preemptive NoCs. First, we elaborate on the existing

the analysis, which efficiently overcomes this limitation, and allows for a
less pessimistic analysis. Finally, through a comprehensive experimental

nonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of
incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power
as communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria, and correlated
equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of
belief-invariant equilibrium appeared in game theory in the 90s. However, the
class of non-signalling correlations associated to belief-invariance arose
naturally already in the 80s in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In the
present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the
above classes of equilibria, together with quantum correlated equilibria, using
tools from quantum information but the language of (algorithmic) game theory.
We present a general framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria,
which contains correlated equilibria and quantum correlated equilibria as
special cases. Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities and
their violations due to non-locality, which is a question of intense interest
in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and it was indeed the original
motivation for the aforementioned studies. Moreover, in our framework we can
also model quantum games where players have conflicting interests, a recent
developing topic in physics. We then use our framework to show new results
related to the social welfare of equilibria. Namely, we exhibit a game where
belief-invariance is socially better than any correlated equilibrium, and a
game where all non-belief-invariant communication equilibria have a suboptimal
social welfare. We also show that optimal social welfare can sometimes be
achieved by quantum mechanical correlations, which do not need an informed
mediator to be implemented, and go beyond the classical shared randomness
approach.

diagrams. In addition, we use these spectra to measure effective temperatures
and assign spectral types, deriving physical properties for 192 RSGs.
Comparison with the solar-metallicity Geneva evolutionary tracks indicates
astonishingly good agreement. The most luminous RSGs in M31 are likely evolved
from 25-30 Mo stars, while the vast majority evolved from stars with initial
masses of 20 Mo or less. There is an interesting bifurcation in the
distribution of RSGs with effective temperatures that increases with higher
luminosities, with one sequence consisting of early K-type supergiants, and
with the other consisting of M-type supergiants that become later (cooler) with
increasing luminosities. This separation is only partially reflected in the
evolutionary tracks, although that might be due to the mis-match in
metallicities between the solar Geneva models and the higher-than-solar
metallicity of M31. As the luminosities increase the median spectral type also
increases; i.e., the higher mass RSGs spend more time at cooler temperatures
than do those of lower luminosities, a result which is new to this study.
Finally we discuss what would be needed observationally to successfully build a
luminosity function that could be used to constrain the mass-loss rates of RSGs
as our Geneva colleagues have suggested.

orbit, it is necessary to consider the effect of gravitational perturbations
due to external bodies. Indeed, these perturbations can become very important
as soon as the altitude of the satellite becomes high, which is the case around
the apocentre of this type of orbit. For several reasons, the traditional tools
of celestial mechanics are not well adapted to the particular dynamic of highly
elliptical orbits. On the one hand, analytical solutions are quite generally
expanded into power series of the eccentricity and therefore limited to
quasi-circular orbits [17, 25]. On the other hand, the time-dependency due to
the motion of the third-body is often neglected. We propose several tools to
overcome these limitations. Firstly, we have expanded the disturbing function
into a finite polynomial using Fourier expansions of elliptic motion functions
in multiple of the satellite's eccentric anomaly (instead of the mean anomaly)
and involving Hansen-like coefficients. Next, we show how to perform a
normalization of the expanded Hamiltonian by means of a time-dependent Lie
transformation which aims to eliminate periodic terms. The difficulty lies in
the fact that the generator of the transformation must be computed by solving a
partial differential equation involving variables which are linear with time
and the eccentric anomaly which is not time linear. We propose to solve this
equation by means of an iterative process.

level. What this method requires is essentially knowledge of the first
derivative of the vector current correlator at zero-momentum. In the
heavy-quark sector this is obtained from the well known heavy quark expansion
in perturbative QCD, leading to values of $a_\mu^{HAD}$ in the charm- and
bottom-quark region which were fully confirmed by later lattice QCD (LQCD)
results. In the light-quark sector, using recent preliminary LQCD results for
the first derivative of the vector current correlator at zero-momentum leads to
the value $a_\mu^{HAD} = (729 - 871)\, \times\,10^{-10}$, which is
significantly larger than values obtained from using $e^+ e^-$ data. A separate
approach based on the operator product expansion (OPE), and designed to quench
the contribution of these data, reduces the discrepancy by at least 40\%. In
addition, it exposes a tension between the OPE and $e^+ e^-$ data, thus
suggesting the blame for the discrepancy on the latter.

prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this

impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the

chemical composition. We showed that the mass of the ingested planet required
to explain the current [Fe/H]^#52 increases by decreasing the age $t_0$ and/or
by decreasing the Iron content of the accreted matter.
  We compared the predictions of a simplified accretion method -- where only
the variation of the surface chemical composition is considered -- with that of
a full accretion model that properly accounts for the modification of the
stellar structure. We showed that the two approaches result in different
convective envelope extension which can vary up to 10 percent. We discussed the
impact of the planet ingestion on a stellar model in the colour-magnitude
diagram, showing that a maximum shift of about 0.06 dex in the colour and 0.07
dex in magnitude are expected and that such variations persist even much later
the accretion episode. We also analysed the systematic bias in the stellar mass

often result in large closed loops in high voltage AC power grids. Sizable
circulating power flows have been recorded around such loops, which take up
transmission line capacity and dissipate but do not deliver electric power.
Power flows in high voltage AC transmission grids are dominantly governed by
voltage angle differences between connected buses, much in the same way as
Josephson currents depend on phase differences between tunnel-coupled
superconductors. From this previously overlooked similarity we argue here that
circulating power flows in AC power grids are analogous to supercurrents
flowing in superconducting rings and in rings of Josephson junctions. We
investigate how circulating power flows can be created and how they behave in
the presence of ohmic dissipation. We show how changing operating conditions
may generate them, how significantly more power is ohmically dissipated in
their presence and how they are topologically protected, even in the presence
of dissipation, so that they persist when operating conditions are returned to
their original values. We identify three mechanisms for creating circulating
power flows, (i) by loss of stability of the equilibrium state carrying no
circulating loop flow, (ii) by tripping of a line traversing a large loop in
the network and (iii) by reclosing a loop that tripped or was open earlier.
Because voltage angles are uniquely defined, circulating power flows can take
on only discrete values, much in the same way as circulation around vortices is
quantized in superfluids.

field sources that is correlated with spectral subtype. Clouds, which are a far
more dominant opacity source for L dwarfs, are the likely cause. On CMDs, the
latest-type low-gravity L dwarfs drive the elbow of the L/T transition up to 1
mag redder and 1 mag fainter than field dwarfs at M_J but are consistent with
or brighter than the elbow at M_W1 and M_W2. Furthermore, there is an
indication on CMD's (such as M_J versus (J-W2) of increasingly redder sequences
separated by gravity classification. Examining bolometric luminosities for
planets and low-gravity objects, we confirm that young M dwarfs are
overluminous while young L dwarfs are normal compared to the field. This
translates into warmer M dwarf temperatures compared to the field sequence
while lower temperatures for L dwarfs.

based on CO observations has been hindered by the effects of CO freeze-out.
Here we present a novel approach to study the mid-plane gas by combining
C$^{18}$O line modelling, CO snowline observations and the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and selectively study the inner tens of au where freeze-out
is not relevant. We apply the modelling technique to the disc around the Herbig
Ae star HD 163296 with particular focus on the regions within the CO snowline
radius, measured to be at 90 au in this disc. Our models yield the mass of
C$^{18}$O in this inner disc region of
$M_{\text{C}^{18}\text{O}}(<90\,\text{au})\sim 2\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$. We
find that most of our models yield a notably low $g/d<20$, especially in the
disc mid-plane ($g/d<1$). Our only models with a more interstellar medium
(ISM)-like $g/d$ require C$^{18}$O to be underabundant with respect to the ISM
abundances and a significant depletion of sub-micron grains, which is not
supported by scattered light observations. Our technique can be applied to a
range of discs and opens up a possibility of measuring gas and dust masses in
discs within the CO snowline location without making assumptions about the
gas-to-dust ratio.

distribution inside a hexagonally ordered array of blind holes patterned in

field and shielding currents across the array reveals the presence of a
non-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the blind holes at
sub-matching fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two
different regions of the array. The mean vortex configuration within the array
is described as a patchy vortex configuration with the patches having different
mean filling fraction. The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more
pronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the
configuration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher
fields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed
by the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual
pulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex
configuration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization
and flux focusing effects within the blind hole array. Effect of the magnetic
field pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a
uniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges.
The enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by
driving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array. The
enhanced shielding current also prevents the uninhibited entry of vortices into
the array. We propose that the metastable patchy vortex configuration within
the blind hole array is due to a non-uniform pinning landscape leading to
non-uniform filling of individual blind holes.

classifiers. A key knowledge of image steganalyzer, which combines relevant
image features and innovative classification procedures, can be deduced by a
deep learning approach called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These kind
of deep learning networks is so well-suited for classification tasks based on
the detection of variations in 2D shapes that it is the state-of-the-art in

embeds less convolutions, with much larger filters in the final convolutional

elsewhere in the brain. These hold the promise of revealing spatial patterns of
connectivity throughout the mammalian brain. To achieve this goal, we seek to
fit a weighted, nonnegative adjacency matrix among 100 $\mu$m brain ""voxels""
using viral tracer data. Despite a multi-year experimental effort, injections
provide incomplete coverage, and the number of voxels in our data is orders of
magnitude larger than the number of injections, making the problem severely
underdetermined. Furthermore, projection data are missing within the injection
site because local connections there are not separable from the injection
signal.
  We use a novel machine-learning algorithm to meet these challenges and
develop a spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity map of the mouse visual
system. Our method combines three features: a matrix completion loss for
missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and
(optionally) a low rank factorization. We demonstrate the consistency of our
estimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse
Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. Our algorithm is
significantly more predictive than current state of the art approaches which
assume regions to be homogeneous. We demonstrate the efficacy of a low rank
version on visual cortex data and discuss the possibility of extending this to
a whole-brain connectivity matrix at the voxel scale.

an important step for star formation studies. It allows both a better link to
observations and a self-consistent monitoring of the magnetic dissipation in
the collapsing core. Our aim is to follow a chemo-dynamical evolution of
collapsing dense cores with a reduced gas-grain chemical network. We present
the results of radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of 1 M$_\odot$ isolated
dense core collapse. The physical setup includes RHD and dynamical evolution of
a chemical network. To perform those simulations, we merged the
multi-dimensional adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES and the thermo-chemistry
Paris-Durham shock code. We simulate the formation of the first hydro-static
core (FHSC) and the co-evolution of 56 species describing mainly H-C-O
chemistry. Accurate benchmarking is performed, testing the reduced chemical
network against a well-establiched complex network. We show that by using a
compact set of reactions, one can match closely the CO abundances with results
of a much more complex network. Our main results are: (a) We find that
gas-grain chemistry post-processing can lead to one order of magnitude lower CO
gas-phase abundances compared to the dynamical chemistry, with strongest effect
during the isothermal phase of collapse. (b) The free-fall time has little
effect on the chemical abundances for our choice of the parameters. (c)
Dynamical chemical evolution is required to describe the CO gas phase abundance
as well as the CO ice formation for the mean grain size larger then 1$\mu{}$m.
(d) Furthermore, dust mean size and size distribution have a strong effect on
chemical abundances and hence on the ionization degree and magnetic
dissipation. We conclude that dust grain growth in the collapse simulations can
be as important as coupling the collapse with chemistry.

acts as a half-wave plate with a radial fast axis orientation operating in the

continuous helical phase ramp for an on axis sources, which creates the orbital
angular momentum. Thanks to that phase, the intensity of the central source is
canceled by a down-stream pupil stop, while the off axis sources are not
affected. However due to experimental conditions the nulling is hardly perfect.
To improve the null, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer containing Dove prisms
differently oriented can be proposed to sort out light based on its orbital
angular momentum (OAM). Thanks to the differential rotation of the beam, a
{\pi} phase shift is achieved for the on axis light affected by a non zero OAM.
Therefore the contrast between the star and its faint companion is enhanced.
Nevertheless, due the Dove prisms birefringence, the performance of the
interferometer is relatively poor. To solve this problem, we propose to add a
birefringent wave-plate in each arm to compensate this birefringence. In this
paper, we will develop the mathematical model of the wave front using the Jones
formalism. The performance of the interferometer is at first computed for the
simple version without the birefringent plate. Then the effect of the
birefringent plate is be mathematically described and the performance is
re-computed.

the standard phase retrieval as well as the phase retrieval by orthogonal

retrieval, low-rank matrix recovery and nonsingular bilinear form. Motivated by
the connections, we present results on the minimal measurement number needed

Applying the results to phase retrieval, we show that generic $d \times d$

the real case and $N \geq 4d-4$ in the complex case for very general classes of

Stiefel-Hopf condition on nonsingular bilinear form. We also give lower bounds

several classes of dimensions $d$ we obtain the precise values of the minimal

using an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is
indispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter
image sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds,
sampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional
communications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous
communication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical
limitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying
frame rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed
performance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of
camera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested
along with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms.
A significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support
both typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low
frame rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate
is lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no
less than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority
voting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when
the frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by
an error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in
decoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable

  Patterns, and Mobility Habits",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of
social networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral
sciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional,
or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this
paper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of
interaction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing
platform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,
face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt
to isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively
homogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the
life course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data
reveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,
distributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,
some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender
preference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity
context, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower
(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.
These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of
gender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and
mobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to
differences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of
sociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.

of University-Industry-Government Relations"" (TH) as attempts to find surplus
value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public R&D. Whereas the firm
is central in the model of OI, the TH adds multi-centeredness: in addition to
firms, universities and (e.g., regional) governments can take leading roles in
innovation eco-systems. In addition to the (transversal) technology transfer at
each moment of time, one can focus on the dynamics in the feedback loops. Under
specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that
drive innovation eco-systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic
generation of new options. The generation of options can be more important than
historical realizations (""best practices"") for the longer-term viability of
knowledge-based innovation systems. A system without sufficient options, for
example, is locked-in. The generation of redundancy -- the Triple Helix
indicator -- can be used as a measure of unrealized but technologically
feasible options given a historical configuration. Different coordination
mechanisms (markets, policies, knowledge) provide different perspectives on the
same information and thus generate redundancy. Increased redundancy not only
stimulates innovation in an eco-system by reducing the prevailing uncertainty;
it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system.
