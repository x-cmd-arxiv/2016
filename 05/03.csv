electronic and magnetic properties of recently synthesized and characterized 5d
double-perovskites Sr2BOsO6 (B=Y, In, Sc). The electronic structure
calculations show that in all compounds, the Os5+ (5d3) site is the only
magnetically active one, while Y3+, In3+ and Sc3+ remain in nonmagnetic states,
with Sc/Y and In featuring d0 and d10 electronic configurations, respectively.
Our studies reveal the important role of closed-shell (d10) versus open-shell
(d0) electronic configurations of the nonmagnetic sites in determining the
overall magnetic exchange interactions. Although the magnetic Os5+ (5d3) site
is the same in all compounds, the magnetic super-exchange interactions mediated
by non-magnetic Y/In/Sc species are strongest for Sr2ScOsO6, weakest for
Sr2InOsO6, and intermediate in case of the Y (d0), due to different energy
overlaps between Os-5d and Y/In/Sc-d states. This explains the experimentally
observed substantial differences in the magnetic transition temperatures of
these materials, despite of an identical magnetic site and underlying magnetic
ground state. Furthermore, short range Os-Os exchange-interactions are more
prominent than long range Os-Os interactions in these compounds, which
contrasts with the behavior of other 3d-5d double-perovskites.

previous calculations of the interferences between the heavy-fermion

modify the line-shape and apparent mass. We find a modest enhancement by $\sim
20$% under favorable circumstances, for a large $\Phi$ width. The effect of
interference on the apparent scalar-pseudoscalar mass difference in a
two-Higgs-doublet model is found to be also modest. An exploratory study
indicates that similar effects are to be expected in the $gg \to \Phi \to Z

dominant $\Phi$ decays are expected to be into $t \bar t$ final states. We

the presence of standard fermions only in the $gg\to \Phi$ loops, it is
destructive causing a dip in the $t \bar t$ mass distribution. Including
additional vector-like quarks leads to a different picture as peaks followed by

invalidates standard proofs that global charges, such as the baryon number,
cannot be conserved by a black hole. By carefully analyzing the standard
arguments based on a Gedankenexperiment in which a black hole is
seemingly-unable to return the baryon number that it swallowed, we identify
inconsistencies in this reasoning, which does not take into the account neither
the existence of skyrmion black holes nor the baryon/skyrmion correspondence.
We then perform a refined Gedankenexperiment by incorporating the new knowledge
and show that no contradiction with conservation of baryon number takes place
at any stage of black hole evolution. Our analysis also indicates no conflict
between semi-classical black holes and the existence of baryonic gauge
interaction arbitrarily-weaker than gravity. Next, we study classical cross
sections of a minimally-coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by a
skyrmion black hole. We investigate how the skyrmion hair manifests itself by
comparing this cross section with the analogous cross section caused by a
Schwarzschild black hole which has the same ADM mass as the skyrmion black
hole. Here we find an order-one difference in the positions of the
characteristic peaks in the cross sections. The peaks are shifted to smaller
scattering angles when the skyrmion hair is present. This comes from the fact
that the skyrmion hair changes the near horizon geometry of the black hole when
compared to a Schwarzschild black hole with same ADM mass. We keep the study of
this second aspect general so that the qualitative results which we obtain can
also be applied to black holes with classical hair of different kind.

distributed bimodally around the mean orbital light curve, with both high and

with the flaring branch of the Z diagram and the low state with the normal

slow brightenings in the low state. High state flares exhibit a narrow range of
amplitudes with a striking cut-off at a maximum amplitude. Optical fluxes
correlate with X-ray fluxes in the high state, but in the low state they are
anti-correlated. These patterns can be seen clearly in both flux-flux diagrams

high state correlation arises promptly with at most a few minutes lag. We
attribute this to thermal reprocessing of X-ray flares. The low state
anti-correlation is broader, consistent with optical lags of between zero and 3
~min, and strongest with respect to high energy X-rays. We suggest that the
decreases in optical flux in the low state may reflect decreasing efficiency of

ensures the existence of zero-energy interface states at the interface of two
bulk systems carrying different Zak phases. In the absence of inversion
symmetry, the Zak phase can take any value and the existence of interface
states is not ensured. We show here that the situation is different when the
unit cell contains multiple degrees of freedom and a hidden inversion symmetry
exists in a subspace of the system. As an example, we consider a system of two
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains coupled by a coupler chain. Although the
introduction of coupler chain breaks the inversion symmetry of the system, a
certain hidden inversion symmetry ensures the existence of a decoupled
$2\times2$ SSH Hamiltonian in the subspace of the entire system and the two
bands associated with this subspace have quantized Zak phases. These
""quantized"" bands in turn can provide topological boundary or interface states
in such systems. Since the entire system has no inversion symmetry, the
bulk-boundary correspondence may not hold exactly. The above is also true when
next-nearest-neighbor hoppings are included. Our systems can be realized

limit our ability to account for structure induced by the observing strategy.
We find that after 10 years of the LSST survey, the best dither strategies lead
to uncertainties in this bias smaller than the minimum statistical floor for a
galaxy catalog as deep as $r$$<$27.5. A few of these strategies bring the
uncertainties close to the statistical floor for $r$$<$25.7 after only one year
of survey.

find that persistent homology can detect differences in synchronization

and habitable environments beyond Earth, a key theme of the National Research
Council's 2013-2022 Decadal Survey. A plume of water vapor and ice spews from
Enceladus's south polar region. Cassini data suggest that this plume, sourced
by a liquid reservoir beneath the moon's icy crust, contain organics, salts,
and water-rock interaction derivatives. Thus, the ingredients for life as we
know it-- liquid water, chemistry, and energy sources-- are available in
Enceladus's subsurface ocean. We have only to sample the plumes to investigate
this hidden ocean environment. We present a New Frontiers class, solar-powered
Enceladus orbiter that would take advantage of this opportunity, Testing the
Habitability of Enceladus's Ocean (THEO). Developed by the 2015 Jet Propulsion
Laboratory Planetary Science Summer School student participants under the
guidance of TeamX, this mission concept includes remote sensing and in situ
analyses with a mass spectrometer, a sub-mm radiometer-spectrometer, a camera,

questions for ascertaining the habitability of Enceladus's ocean within the
context of the moon's geological activity: (1) How are the plumes and ocean
connected? (2) Are the abiotic conditions of the ocean suitable for
habitability? (3) How stable is the ocean environment? (4) Is there evidence of
biological processes? By taking advantage of the opportunity Enceladus's plumes
offer, THEO represents a viable, solar-powered option for exploring a
potentially habitable ocean world of the outer solar system.

many-to-one formulas for growth-fragmentations and define the notion of

Panagiotopoulos and coworkers predicted [Nat. Commun. 5, 4472 (2014)] that the
hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure of hard spheres can be stabilized in
such a mixture due to the interplay between polymer and the void structure in
the crystal phase. Their predictions were based on estimates of the free-energy
penalty for adding a single hard polymer chain in the HCP and the competing
face centered cubic (FCC) phase. Here we calculate the phase diagram using
free-energy calculations of the full binary mixture and find a broad
fluid-solid coexistence region and a metastable gas-liquid coexistence region.
For the colloid-monomer size ratio considered in this work, we find that the
HCP phase is only stable in a small window at relatively high polymer reservoir
packing fractions, where the coexisting HCP phase is nearly close packed.
Additionally we investigate the structure and dynamic behaviour of these

lid-driven cavity, to the study of inertial effects, using a finite volume
method and the Papanastasiou regularisation of the Bingham constitutive model
[J. Rheology 31 (1987) 385-404]. The finite volume method used belongs to a
very popular class of methods for solving Newtonian flow problems, which use
the SIMPLE algorithm to solve the discretised set of equations, and have
matured over the years. By regularising the Bingham constitutive equation it is
easy to extend such a solver to Bingham flows since all that this requires is
to modify the viscosity function. This is a tempting approach, since it
requires minimum programming effort and makes available all the existing
features of the mature finite volume solver. On the other hand, regularisation
introduces a parameter which controls the error in addition to the grid
spacing, and makes it difficult to locate the yield surfaces. Furthermore, the
equations become stiffer and more difficult to solve, while the discontinuity
at the yield surfaces causes large truncation errors. The present work attempts
to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of such a method by applying it to
the lid-driven cavity problem for a range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers (up
to 100 and 5000 respectively). By employing techniques such as multigrid, local
grid refinement, and an extrapolation procedure to reduce the effect of the
regularisation parameter on the calculation of the yield surfaces (Liu et al.
J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 102 (2002) 179-191), satisfactory results are
obtained, although the weaknesses of the method become more noticeable as the
Bingham number is increased.

this novel perspective is to provide an elegant classification of associative
theories in terms of the geometric features of fractal sets. In particular, the
dimension of fractals can measure the efficiency of conditioning models. We
illustrate the correspondence with the examples of the Hull, Rescorla-Wagner,

stability analysis to a turbulent swirling jet undergoing a control parameter
transient. The flow undergoes a transition from a non-vortex breakdown state to
a state with a strong recirculation bubble and the associated global mode.
High-speed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements are the basis for a
local linear stability analysis of the temporarily evolving base flow. This
analysis reveals that the onset of the global mode is strongly linked to the
formation of the internal stagnation point. Several transition scenarios are
discussed and the ability of a frequency selection criterion to predict the
wavemaker location, frequency and growth rate of the global mode are evaluated.
We find excellent agreement between the linear global mode frequency and the
experimental results throughout the entire transient. The corresponding growth
rate qualitatively conforms to experimental observations. We find no indication

trapped two-dimensional degenerate Bose gas. The analysis is inspired by recent
experiments on ultracold atoms where power-law correlations have been observed
despite the presence of the external potential. We generalize the spin wave
description of phase fluctuations to the trapped case and obtain an analytical
expression for the one-body density matrix within this approximation. We show
that algebraic decay of the central correlation function persists to lengths of
about 20% of the Thomas--Fermi radius. We establish that the trap-averaged
correlation function decays algebraically with a strictly larger exponent
weakly changing with trap size and find indications that the recently observed
enhanced scaling exponents receive significant contributions from the normal
component of the gas. We discuss radial and angular correlations and propose a
local correlation approximation which captures the correlations very well. Our
analysis goes beyond the usual local density approximation and the developed
summation techniques constitute a powerful tool to investigate correlations in
inhomogeneous systems.

there is indeed an important characteristic difference in the behavior of gyro
spin precession frequency in the limit of approach to these compact objects,
and this can be used, in principle, to differentiate the naked singularity from
black hole. Specifically, if gyroscopes are fixed all along the polar axis upto
the horizon of a Kerr black hole, the precession frequency becomes arbitrarily
high, blowing up as the event horizon is approached. On the other hand, in the
case of naked singularity, this frequency remains always finite and
well-behaved. Interestingly, this behavior is intimately related to and is
governed by the geometry of the ergoregion in each of these cases which we
analyze here. One intriguing behavior that emerges is, in the Kerr naked
singularity case, the Lense-Thirring precession frequency ($\Omega_{\rm LT}$)
of the gyroscope due to frame-dragging effect decreases as ($\Omega_{\rm

dominant coherent structures, such as the von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex street and
the global spiral mode associated with the vortex breakdown of swirling jets.
In recent years, linear stability analysis has been applied successfully to
turbulent time-mean flows, instead of laminar base-flows,
\textcolor{black}{which requires turbulent models that account for the
interaction of the turbulent field with the coherent structures. To retain the
stability equations of laminar flows, the Boussinesq approximation with a
spatially nonuniform but isotropic eddy viscosity is typically employed. In
this work we assess the applicability of this concept to turbulent strongly
swirling jets, a class of flows that is particularly unsuited for isotropic
eddy viscosity models. Indeed we find that unsteady RANS simulations only match
with experiments with a Reynolds stress model that accounts for an anisotropic
eddy viscosity. However, linear stability analysis of the mean flow is shown to
accurately predict the global mode growth rate and frequency if the employed
isotropic eddy viscosity represents a least-squares approximation of the
anisotropic eddy viscosity. Viscosities derived from the $k-\epsilon$ model did
not achieve a good prediction of the mean flow nor did they allow for accurate
stability calculations. We conclude from this study that linear stability
analysis can be accurate for flows with strongly anisotropic turbulent
viscosity and the capability of the Boussinesq approximation in terms of
URANS-based mean flow prediction is not a prerequisite.

no consensus as to what a bond actually is. Therefore, a variety of bonding
models have been developed, each defining the structure of molecules in a
different manner with the goal of explaining and predicting chemical
properties. This thesis describes the initial development of gradient bundle
analysis (GBA), a chemical bonding model that creates a high resolution picture
of chemical interactions within the charge density framework. GBA is based on
concepts from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), but uses a more
complete picture of the topology and geometry of the electron charge density to
understand and predict bonding interactions. Gradient bundles are defined as
volumes bounded by zero-flux surfaces (ZFSs) in the gradient of the charge
density with well-defined energies. The structure of gradient bundles provides
an avenue for detecting the locations of valence electrons, which correspond to
reactive regions in a molecule. The number of electrons in bonding regions,
which are defined by the lowering of kinetic energy in gradient bundles, is
found to correlate to bond dissociation energy in diatomic molecules.
Furthermore, site reactivity can be understood and predicted by observing the
motion of ZFSs bounding gradient bundles and calculating condensed gradient
bundle Fukui functions. Using only the ground state charge density, I present
preliminary results for a method that predicts which regions in a molecule are
most likely to undergo nucleophilic and electrophilic attack, effectively
locating the HOMO and LUMO.

  dwarfs: Implications for the planets of TRAPPIST-1","Accepted in MNRAS. 14 pages",,"10.1093/mnras/stw2578",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultracool dwarfs (UCD; $T_{\rm eff}<\sim3000~$K) cool to settle on the main
sequence after $\sim$1 Gyr. For brown dwarfs, this cooling never stops. Their
habitable zone (HZ) thus sweeps inward at least during the first Gyr of their
lives. Assuming they possess water, planets found in the HZ of UCDs have
experienced a runaway greenhouse phase too hot for liquid water prior to
entering the HZ. It has been proposed that such planets are desiccated by this
hot early phase and enter the HZ as dry worlds. Here we model the water loss
during this pre-HZ hot phase taking into account recent upper limits on the XUV
emission of UCDs and using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We address
the whole range of UCDs but also focus on the planets recently found around the
$0.08~M_\odot$ dwarf TRAPPIST-1.
  Despite assumptions maximizing the FUV-photolysis of water and the XUV-driven
escape of hydrogen, we find that planets can retain significant amounts of
water in the HZ of UCDs, with a sweet spot in the $0.04$-$0.06~M_\odot$ range.
We also studied the TRAPPIST-1 system using observed constraints on the
XUV-flux. We find that TRAPPIST-1b and c may have lost as much as 15 Earth
Oceans and planet d -- which might be inside the HZ -- may have lost less than
1 Earth Ocean. Depending on their initial water contents, they could have
enough water to remain habitable. TRAPPIST-1 planets are key targets for
atmospheric characterization and could provide strong constraints on the water
erosion around UCDs.

policy-based decisions simultaneously in path vectors. A complete view on the
Internet backbone routing is given by the collection of all valid routes, which
is infeasible to obtain due to information hiding of BGP, the lack of
omnipresent collection points, and data complexity. Commonly, graph-based data
models are used to represent the Internet topology from a given set of BGP
routing tables but fall short of explaining policy contexts. As a consequence,
routing anomalies such as route leaks and interception attacks cannot be
explained with graphs.
  In this paper, we use formal languages to represent the global routing system
in a rigorous model. Our CAIR framework translates BGP announcements into a
finite route language that allows for the incremental construction of minimal
route automata. CAIR preserves route diversity, is highly efficient, and
well-suited to monitor BGP path changes in real-time. We formally derive
implementable search patterns for route leaks and interception attacks. In
contrast to the state-of-the-art, we can detect these incidents. In practical
experiments, we analyze public BGP data over the last seven years.

researchers in power systems, intelligent transportation, and industrial

objective, resulting in social optimization, or try to satisfy their own
selfish objectives using a noncooperative differential game. However, in these
solutions, large volumes of data must be sent from system states to possibly
distant control inputs, thus resulting in high cost of the underlying
communication network. To enable economically-viable communication, a
game-theoretic framework is proposed under the \textit{communication cost}, or
\textit{sparsity}, constraint, given by the number of communicating
state/control input pairs. As this constraint tightens, the system transitions
from dense to sparse communication, providing the trade-off between dynamic
system performance and information exchange. Moreover, using the proposed
sparsity-constrained distributed social optimization and noncooperative game
algorithms, we develop a method to allocate the costs of the communication
infrastructure fairly and according to the agents' diverse needs for feedback

To mitigate this problem we design appropriate channel access policies for

optimization problem where the total transmit power of the sensors is minimized
while desired control performance is guaranteed for each involved control loop.
Control performance is abstracted as a desired expected decrease rate of a
given Lyapunov function for each loop. We prove that the optimal channel access
policies are decoupled and, intuitively, each sensor balances the gains from
transmitting to its actuator with the negative interference effect on all other
control loops. Moreover the optimal policies are of a threshold nature, that
is, a sensor transmits only under favorable local fading conditions. Finally,
we show that the optimal policies can be computed by a distributed iterative
procedure which does not require coordination between the sensors.

potential is used to navigate to the minimum of the natural potential while
avoiding collisions. The artificial potential combines the natural potential
with potentials that repel the agent from the border of the obstacles. This is
a popular approach to navigation problems because it can be implemented with
spatially local information that is acquired during operation time. Artificial
potentials can, however, have local minima that prevent navigation to the
minimum of the natural potential. This paper derives conditions that guarantee
artificial potentials have a single minimum that is arbitrarily close to the
minimum of the natural potential. The qualitative implication is that
artificial potentials succeed when either the condition number-- the ratio of
the maximum over the minimum eigenvalue-- of the Hessian of the natural
potential is not large and the obstacles are not too flat or when the
destination is not close to the border of an obstacle. Numerical analyses
explore the practical value of these theoretical conclusions.

driving of galactic winds and outflows. Recent galaxy formation simulations
have demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of
diffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due
to computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR
transport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of
isolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\rm{M_\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh
code {\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective
transport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic
diffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of
strong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the
simulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic
diffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to
quickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic
diffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes
dominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\sim 300\,{\rm
Myrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In
particular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the
amplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no
diffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include
CR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion.

difficulty of collisional excitation, we compared these results with those of
the calculation of infrared radiative pumping, using the available infrared
5-35 micron spectrum. We found that all of the observational results were
reproduced, if the HCN abundance was significantly higher than that of HCO+ and
HNC. The flux ratio and excitation temperature between v2=1f and v=0, after

affects rotational (J-level) excitation at v=0 at least for HCN and HNC. The
HCN-to-HCO+ v=0 flux ratio is higher than those of starburst-dominated regions,
and will increase even more when thederived high HCN opacity is corrected. The
enhanced HCN-to-HCO+ flux ratio in this AGN-hosting galaxy can be explained by
the high HCN-to-HCO+ abundance ratio and sufficient HCN excitation at up to

showed that gravity alone can drive turbulence in galactic disks, regulate
their Toomre $Q$ parameters to $\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate
sufficient to fuel star formation in the centers of present-day galaxies. In
this paper we extend our models to include the effects of star formation
feedback. We show that feedback suppresses galaxies' star formation rates by a
factor of $\sim$ 5 and leads to the formation of a multi-phase atomic and
molecular ISM. Both the star formation rate and the phase balance produced in
our simulations agree well with observations of nearby spirals. After our
galaxies reach steady state, we find that the inclusion of feedback actually
lowers the gas velocity dispersion slightly compared to the case of pure
self-gravity, and also slightly reduces the rate of inward mass transport.
Nevertheless, we find that, even with feedback included, our galactic disks
self-regulate to $Q$ $\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate sufficient
to supply a substantial fraction of the inner disk star formation. We argue
that gravitational instability is therefore likely to be the dominant source of

designed for detailed evolution of galactic discs. We evolve discs in a series
of annuli with fixed specific angular momentum, which allows us to make
predictions for the radial and angular-momentum structure of galaxies. Most
physical processes, including all channels of star formation and associated
feedback, are performed in these annuli. We present the surface density
profiles of our model spiral galaxies, both as a function of radius and
specific angular momentum, and find the discs naturally build a
pseduobulge-like component. Our main results are focussed on predictions
relating to the integrated mass--specific angular momentum relation of stellar
discs. The model produces a distinct sequence between these properties in
remarkable agreement with recent observational literature. We investigate the
impact Toomre disc instabilities have on shaping this sequence and find they
are crucial for regulating both the mass and spin of discs. Without
instabilities, high-mass discs would be systematically deficient in specific
angular momentum by a factor of ~2.5, with increased scatter. Instabilities
also appear to drive the direction in which the mass--spin sequence of spiral
galaxy discs evolves. With them, we find galaxies of fixed mass have higher
specific angular momentum at later epochs.

magnetic fields whereas dense filaments tend to be perpendicular to them. When
and why this transition occurs remain uncertain. To explore the physics behind
this transition, we compute the histogram of relative orientation (HRO) between
the density gradient and the magnetic field in 3D MHD simulations of prestellar
core formation in shock-compressed regions within GMCs. We find that, in the
magnetically-dominated (sub-Alfv\'enic) post-shock region, the gas structure is
preferentially aligned with the local magnetic field. For overdense sub-regions
with super-Alfv\'enic gas, their elongation becomes preferentially
perpendicular to the local magnetic field instead. The transition occurs when
self-gravitating gas gains enough kinetic energy from the gravitational
acceleration to overcome the magnetic support against the cross-field
contraction, which results in a power-law increase of the field strength with
density. Similar results can be drawn from HROs in projected 2D maps with
integrated column densities and synthetic polarized dust emission. We
quantitatively analyze our simulated polarization properties, and interpret the
reduced polarization fraction at high column densities as the result of
increased distortion of magnetic field directions in trans- or super-Alfv\'enic
gas. Furthermore, we introduce measures of the inclination and tangledness of
the magnetic field along the line of sight as the controlling factors of the
polarization fraction. Observations of the polarization fraction and angle
dispersion can therefore be utilized in studying local magnetic field
morphology in star-forming regions.

simplest model needs to be extended, and whether doing so could improve our
understanding of the properties of dark matter. One established
parameterisation for generalising the CDM fluid is the Generalised Dark Matter
(GDM) model, in which dark matter is an imperfect fluid with pressure and shear
viscosity that fulfill certain closure equations. We investigate these closure
equations and the three new parametric functions they contain: the background
equation of state w, the speed of sound c_s^2 and the viscosity c_{vis}^2.
Taking these functions to be constant parameters, we analyse an exact solution
of the perturbed Einstein equations in a GDM-dominated universe and discuss the
main effects of the three parameters on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
Our analysis suggests that the CMB alone is not able to distinguish between the
GDM sound speed and viscosity parameters, but that other observables, such as
the matter power spectrum, are required to break this degeneracy. We also
consider other descriptions of imperfect fluids that have a non-perturbative
definition and relate these to the GDM model. In particular, we consider scalar
fields, an effective field theory (EFT) of fluids, an EFT of Large Scale
Structure, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and tightly-coupled fluids. These
descriptions could be used to extend the GDM model into the nonlinear regime of
structure formation, which is necessary if the wealth of data available on
those scales is to be employed in constraining the model. We also derive the
initial conditions for adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations and provide the
result in a form ready for implementation in Einstein-Boltzmann solvers.

heating for the neutral interstellar medium. Simulations of spiral galaxies
found some indication that photoelectric heating could suppress star formation.
However, simulations that include photoelectric heating have typically found
that it has little effect on the rate of star formation in either spiral
galaxies or dwarfs suggesting that supernovae and not photoelectric heating are
responsible for setting the star formation law in galaxies. This result is in
tension with recent work indicating that a star formation law that depends on
galaxy metallicity, as expected for photoelectric heating but not for
supernovae, reproduces the present-day galaxy population better than a
metallicity-independent one. Here we report a series of simulations of dwarf
galaxies, where the effects of both photoelectric heating and supernovae are
expected to be strongest. We simultaneously include space- and time-dependent
photoelectric heating, and we resolve the Sedov phase of every supernova blast
wave, allowing us to make a direct measurement of the relative importance of
momentum injection by supernovae and dust heating by far ultraviolet (FUV)
photons in suppressing star formation. We find that supernovae are unable to
account for the long observed gas depletion times in dwarf galaxies. Instead,
ordinary photoelectric heating is the dominant means by which dwarf galaxies
regulate their star formation rate at any given time, suppressing the star
formation rate by more than an order of magnitude relative to simulations with
only supernovae.

we did not detect LP in all bands, with 3 sigma upper limits of, e.g., 1.4% in
the R-band. We built the NIR-optical averaged spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the system, that could be well described by an irradiated black body
with radius $R_{*} = 0.33\pm0.03\,R_{\odot}$ and albedo $\eta=0.32\pm0.05$,
without the need of further components (thus excluding the visible presence of
an extended accretion disc and/or of relativistic jets). The case was different
for PSR J1023+0038, that was in its accretion phase during our campaign. We
measured a LP of $1.09\pm0.27\%$ and $0.90\pm 0.17\%$ in the V and R bands,
respectively. The phase-resolved polarimetric curve of the source in the R-band
reveals a hint of a sinusoidal modulation at the source 4.75 hr orbital period,
peaked at the same orbital phase as the light curve. The measured LP of PSR
J1023+0038 could in principle be interpreted as scattering with free electrons
(that can be found in the accretion disc of the system or even in the hot
corona that surrounds the disc itself) or to synchrotron emission from a
relativistic particles jet or outflow. However, the NIR-optical SED of the
system built starting from our dataset did not suggest the presence of a jet.
We conclude that the optical LP observed for PSR J1023+0038 is possibly due to
Thomson scattering with electrons in the disc, as also suggested from the
possible modulation of the R-band LP at the system orbital period.

on the simplest scenario in which sterile neutrinos mixes only with muon or tau

strongly enhanced by a Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance, so that
a substantial flux is expected to emerge from a supernova, even if vacuum
mixing angles between active and sterile neutrinos are tiny. Using energetics
arguments, this yields limits on the sterile neutrino parameter space that
reach down to mixing angles of the order of $\sin^2 2\theta \lesssim 10^{-14}$
and are up to an order of magnitude stronger than those from X-ray
observations. While supernova limits suffer from larger systematic
uncertainties than X-ray limits they apply also to scenarios in which sterile
neutrinos are not abundantly produced in the early Universe. We also compute
the flux of $\mathcal{O}(\text{MeV})$ photons expected from the decay of
sterile neutrinos produced in supernovae, but find that it is beyond current
observational reach even for a nearby supernova.

relatively low merger fraction in UV/optical-selected, unobscured AGN sample

ten lines of sight towards the inner Galaxy. [N II] emission can be used to
estimate the contribution of the highly ionized gas to the [C II] emission and
separate the highly ionized and weakly ionized neutral gas. We find that [N II]
has strong emission in distinct spectral features along all lines of sight
associated with strong [C II] emission. The [N II] arises from moderate density
extended HII regions or ionized boundary layers of clouds. Comparison of the [N
II] and [C II] spectra in 31 separate kinematic features shows that many of the
[C II] spectra are affected by absorption from low excitation gas associated
with molecular clouds, sometimes strongly so. The apparent fraction of the [C
II] associated with the [N II] gas is unrealistically large in many cases, most
likely due to the reduction of [C II] by absorption. In a few cases the
foreground absorption can be modeled to determine the true source intensity. In
these sources we find that the foreground absorbing gas layer has C$^+$ column
densities of order 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. [C II] emission arising from strong
sources of [N II] emission is frequently absorbed by low excitation foreground

systems with large antenna arrays, such as millimeter wave and massive MIMO
systems. Most prior work represents two extreme cases in which either a small
number of RF chains with full-resolution ADCs, or low resolution ADC with a
number of RF chains equal to the number of antennas is assumed. In this paper,
a generalized hybrid architecture with a small number of RF chains and finite
number of ADC bits is proposed. For this architecture, achievable rates with
channel inversion and SVD based transmission methods are derived. Results show
that the achievable rate is comparable to that obtained by full-precision ADC
receivers at low and medium SNRs. A trade-off between the achievable rate and
power consumption for different numbers of bits and RF chains is devised. This
enables us to draw some conclusions on the number of ADC bits needed to
maximize the system energy efficiency. Numerical simulations show that coarse
ADC quantization is optimal under various system configurations. This means
that hybrid combining with coarse quantization achieves better energy-rate
trade-off compared to both hybrid combining with full-resolutions ADCs and

expansion history after baryogenesis, and the baryon isocurvature
perturbations. We show that cosmological considerations alone provide powerful
constraints, especially for the minimal scenario with a quadratic scalar
potential. Intriguingly, we find that for a given inflation scale, the other
parameters including the reheat temperature, decoupling temperature of the
baryon violating interactions, and the mass and decay constant of the scalar
are restricted to lie within ranges of at most a few orders of magnitude. We
also discuss possible extensions to the minimal setup, and propose two ideas
for evading constraints on isocurvature perturbations: one is to suppress the
baryon isocurvature with nonquadratic scalar potentials, another is to
compensate the baryon isocurvature with cold dark matter isocurvature by making
the scalar survive until the present.

number of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder
renormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent
intervals grows logarithmically with the intervals length. In particular, the
scaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different
prefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal
simple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function
of the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in
contrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our
predictions using a numerical implementation of the SDRG method. Finally, we
also implement DMRG simulations for the negativity in open spin chains. The

by extending the notion of system modularity in its broadest sense.
Acknowledging that modularity is not a binary feature and comes in various
types and levels, the proposed framework introduces higher levels of modularity
that naturally incorporate decentralized architecture on the one hand and
autonomy in agents and subsystems on the other. This makes the framework
suitable for modularity decisions in Systems of Systems and for analyzing the
impact of modularity on broader surrounding ecosystems. The stages of
modularity in the proposed framework are naturally aligned with the level of
variations and uncertainty in the system and its environment, a relationship
that is central to the benefits of modularity. The conceptual framework is
complemented with a decision layer that makes it suitable to be used as a
computational architecture decision tool to determine the appropriate stage and
level of modularity of a system, for a given profile of variations and
uncertainties in its environment. We further argue that the fundamental
systemic driving forces and trade-offs of moving from monolithic to distributed
architecture are essentially similar to those for moving from integral to
modular architectures. The spectrum, in conjunction with the decision layer,
could guide system architects when selecting appropriate parameters and
building a system-specific computational tool from a combination of existing
tools and techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a case
for fractionated satellite systems based on a simplified demo of the DARPA F6
program is presented.

quasiparticle degrees of freedom and collective vibrations (phonons) introduces
a time-dependent effective interaction, in addition to the exchange of pion and

contributions are treated in the resonant time-blocking approximation, in
analogy to previously developed relativistic quasiparticle time blocking

is called proton-neutron RQTBA (pn-RQTBA) and applied to Gamow-Teller resonance

of the resonance along with quenching of the strength, as compared to pn-RQRPA,

half-lives of the considered isotopes are computed and compared to pn-RQRPA
half-lives and to experimental data. It is shown that a considerable
improvement of the half-life description is obtained in pn-RQTBA because of the

then these are still vulnerable, especially as reverse engineers use more
advanced and precise techniques. On the other hand, the proposed threshold

functionality. Detailed circuit simulations of our proposed threshold dependent
camouflaged cells demonstrate that they can be used to cost-effectively and
robustly camouflage large netlists. Corner analysis of process, temperature,

between two graphs, which has invited research interest in several communities.
Specific versions of this problem include link prediction in social networks,
ontology alignment between metadata-rich RDF data, approximate joins, and
entity resolution between instance-rich data. As large datasets continue to
proliferate, reducing quadratic complexity to make the task practical is an
important research problem. Within the entity resolution community, the problem
is commonly referred to as blocking. A particular class of learnable blocking
schemes is known as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) blocking schemes, and has
emerged as state-of-the art for homogeneous (i.e. same-schema) tabular data.
Despite the promise of these schemes, a formalism or learning framework has not
been developed for them when input data instances are generic, attributed
graphs possessing both node and edge heterogeneity. With such a development,

the periciliary layer is comparable to cilia length. Perturbations to this
system, whether due to a genetic disorder or acquired causes, are directly
linked to infection and disease. For example, depletion of the periciliary
layer is typically observed in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and cystic fibrosis. Clinical evidence connects the periciliary layer
depletion to reduced rates of mucus clearance. In this work, we develop a novel
computational model to study mucociliary transport in a microfluidic channel
consisting of a mucus layer (viscoelastic fluid) atop a periciliary layer
(nearly-viscous fluid). We systematically vary the viscoelastic properties and
thickness of the mucus layer to emulate healthy and diseased conditions. We
assess cilia performance in terms of three metrics: flow transport, internal
power expended by the cilia, and transport efficiency. We find that, compared
to a control case with no mucus, a healthy mucus layer enhances cilia
performance in all three metrics. That is to say, a healthy mucus layer not
only improves flow transport, resulting in better clearance of harmful
substances, but it does so at an energetic advantage to the cilia. In healthy
states, an increase in the mucus elastic properties enhances transport
efficiency. In contrast, under diseased conditions where the periciliary layer
is depleted, mucus hinders transport... (trimmed by length restriction)

  Extended Version",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a discrete-time remote estimation system formed by an encoder, a
transmission policy, a channel, and a remote estimator. The encoder assesses a
random process that the remote estimator seeks to estimate based on information
sent to it by the encoder via the channel. The channel is affected by Bernoulli
drops. The instantaneous probability of a drop is governed by a finite state
machine (FSM). The state of the FSM is denoted as the channel state. At each
time step, the encoder decides whether to attempt a transmission through the
packet-drop link. The sequence of encoder decisions is the input to the FSM.
This paper seeks to design an encoder, transmission policy and remote estimator
that minimize a finite-horizon mean squared error cost. We present two
structural results. The first result in which we assume that the process to be
estimated is white and Gaussian, we show that there is an optimal transmission
policy governed by a threshold on the estimation error. The second result
characterizes optimal symmetric transmission policies for the case when the
measured process is the state of a scalar linear time-invariant plant driven by
white Gaussian noise. Use-dependent packet-drop channels can be used to
quantify the effect of transmission on channel quality when the encoder is
powered by energy harvesting. An application to a mixed initiative system in
which a human operator performs visual search tasks is also presented.

In this process, up to 2j particles are allowed to occupy a lattice site, the

species of particles in which heavier particles can force lighter particles to
switch places. Assuming closed boundary conditions, we explicitly write the
reversible measures and a self-duality function, generalizing previously known
results for two-species ASEP and single-species ASEP(q,j).
  Additionally, it is shown that this multi-species ASEP(q,j) is dual to its
space-reversed version, in which particles drift to the left. As j goes to
infinity, this multi-species ASEP(q,j) converges to a multi-species q-TAZRP and
the self-duality function has a non-trivial limit, showing that this
multi-species q-TAZRP satisfies a space-reversed self-duality.
  The construction of the process and the proofs are accomplished utilizing

multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian Z-interference channel with an arbitrary number
of antennas at each node is established under the assumption of delayed channel
state information at transmitters (CSIT). The GDoF region is parameterized by
$\alpha$, which links the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) to the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) via $INR=SNR^{\alpha}$. A new outer bound for the
GDoF region is established by maximizing a bound on the weighted sum-rate of
the two users, which in turn is obtained by using a combination of genie-aided
side-information and an extremal inequality. The maximum weighted sum-rate in
the high SNR regime is shown to occur when the transmission covariance matrix
of the interfering transmitter has full rank. An achievability scheme based on
block-Markov encoding and backward decoding is developed which uses
interference quantization and digital multicasting to take advantage of the
channel statistics of the cross-link, and the scheme is separately shown to be
GDoF-optimal in both the weak ($\alpha\leq1$) and strong ($\alpha>1$)
interference regimes. This is the first complete characterization of the GDoF
region of any interference network with delayed CSIT, as well as the first such
GDoF characterization of a MIMO network with delayed CSIT and arbitrary number
of antennas at each node. For all antenna tuples, the GDoF region is shown to
be equal to or larger than the degrees of freedom (DoF) region over the entire
range of $\alpha$, which leads to a V-shaped maximum sum-GDoF as a function of
$\alpha$, with the minimum occurring at $\alpha=1$. The delayed CSIT GDoF
region and the sum-DoF are compared with their counterparts under perfect CSIT,
thereby characterizing all antenna tuples and ranges of $\alpha$ for which
delayed CSIT is sufficient to achieve the perfect CSIT GDoF region or sum-DoF.

adjusting the surface texture. Despite decades of intensive study, there are
still many experimental results that are not well understood because
conventional wetting theory, which assume an infinite droplet size, has been
used to explain measurements of finite-sized droplets. In this study, we
suggest a wetting theory that is applicable to any droplet size based on the
free energy landscape analysis of various wetting modes of finite-sized
droplets on a 2D textured surface. The key finding of our study is that there
are many quantized wetting angles with local free energy minima; the
implication of this is remarkable. We find that the conventional theories can
predict the contact angle at the global free energy minimum if the droplet size
is 40 times or larger than the characteristic scale of the surface roughness.
Furthermore, we confirm that the pinning origin is the local free energy minima
and obtain the energy barriers of pinning as a function of geometric factors.
We validate our theory against experimental results on an anisotropic rough
surface. In addition, we discuss wetting on a non-uniform rough surface with a
rough central region and flat edge. Our findings clarify the extent to which
the conventional wetting theory is valid and expand the physical understanding
of wetting phenomena of small liquid drops on rough surfaces.

dust are known to be underrepresented in optical quasar surveys. By defining a
complete parent sample of the brightest and spatially unresolved quasars in the
COSMOS field, we quantify to which extent this sub-population is fundamental to
our understanding of the true population of quasars. By using the available
multiwavelength data of various surveys in the COSMOS field, we built a parent
sample of 33 quasars brighter than $J=20$ mag, identified by reliable X-ray to
radio wavelength selection techniques. Spectroscopic follow-up with the
NOT/ALFOSC was carried out for four candidate quasars that had not been
targeted previously to obtain a 100\% redshift completeness of the sample. The
population of high $A_V$ quasars (HAQs), a specific sub-population of quasars
selected from optical/near-infrared photometry, is found to contribute
$21\%^{+9}_{-5}$ of the parent sample. The full population of bright spatially
unresolved quasars represented by our parent sample consists of
$39\%^{+9}_{-8}$ reddened quasars defined by having $A_V>0.1$, and
$21\%^{+9}_{-5}$ of the sample having $E(B-V)>0.1$ assuming the extinction
curve of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We show that the HAQ selection works well
for selecting reddened quasars, but some are missed because their optical
spectra are too blue to pass the $g-r$ color cut in the HAQ selection. This is
either due to a low degree of dust reddening or anomalous spectra. We find that
the fraction of quasars with contributing light from the host galaxy is most
dominant at $z \lesssim 1$. At higher redshifts the population of spatially
unresolved quasars selected by our parent sample is found to be representative
of the full population at $J<20$ mag. This work quantifies the bias against
reddened quasars in studies that are based solely on optical surveys.

bikes among stations in self-service bike-sharing systems. This problem can be
seen as a variant of the one-commodity pickup and delivery vehicle routing
problem, where multiple visits are allowed to be performed at each station,
i.e., the demand of a station is allowed to be split. Moreover, a vehicle may
temporarily drop its load at a station, leaving it in excess or, alternatively,
collect more bikes from a station (even all of them), thus leaving it in
default. Both cases require further visits in order to meet the actual demands
of such station. This paper deals with a particular case of the SBRP, in which
only a single vehicle is available and the objective is to find a least-cost
route that meets the demand of all stations and does not violate the minimum
(zero) and maximum (vehicle capacity) load limits along the tour. Therefore,
the number of bikes to be collected or delivered at each station should be
appropriately determined in order to respect such constraints. We propose an
iterated local search (ILS) based heuristic to solve the problem. The ILS
algorithm was tested on 980 benchmark instances from the literature and the
results obtained are quite competitive when compared to other existing methods.
Moreover, our heuristic was capable of finding most of the known optimal
solutions and also of improving the results on a number of open instances.

dynamic spintronics and contemporary magnetism, in which much progress has been
made in the past decade, based on the creation of a variety of micro- and
nano-structured devices that enable electrical detection of magnetization
dynamics. The primary focus is on the physics of spin rectification effects,
which are well suited for studying magnetization dynamics and spin transport in
a variety of magnetic materials and spintronic devices. Intended to be
intelligible to a broad audience, the paper begins with a pedagogical
introduction, comparing the methods of electrical detection of charge and spin
dynamics in semiconductors and magnetic materials respectively. After that it
provides a comprehensive account of the theoretical study of both the angular
dependence and line shape of electrically detected ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR), which is summarized in a handbook formate easy to be used for analyzing
experimental data. We then review and examine the similarity and differences of
various spin rectification effects found in ferromagnetic films, magnetic
bilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions, including a discussion of how to
properly distinguish spin rectification from the spin pumping/inverse spin Hall
effect generated voltage. After this we review the broad applications of
rectification effects for studying spin waves, nonlinear dynamics, domain wall
dynamics, spin current, and microwave imaging. We also discuss spin
rectification in ferromagnetic semiconductors. The paper concludes with both
historical and future perspectives, by summarizing and comparing three
generations of FMR spectroscopy which have been developed for studying
magnetization dynamics.

achieved by the Fermi LAT, we use machine learning classifiers (Random Forest
and XGBoost) to pinpoint potentially novel source classes in the unassociated
3FGL sample outside the Galactic plane. Here we report a total of 34
high-confidence Galactic candidates at |b| > 5 degrees. The currently favored
standard astrophysical interpretations for these objects are pulsars or
low-luminosity globular clusters hosting millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Yet, these
objects could also be interpreted as dark matter annihilation taking place in
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies or dark matter subhalos. Unfortunately, Fermi LAT
spectra are not sufficient to break degeneracies between the different
scenarios. Careful visual inspection of archival optical images reveals no
obvious evidence for low-luminosity globular clusters or ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies inside the 95% error ellipses. If these are pulsars, this would bring
the total number of MSPs at |b| > 5 degrees to 106. We find this number to be
in excellent agreement with predictions from a new population synthesis of MSPs
that predicts 100-126 high-latitude 3FGL MSPs depending on the choice of
high-energy emission model. If, however, these are dark matter substructures,
we can place upper limits on the number of Galactic subhalos surviving today
and on dark matter annihilation cross sections. These limits are beginning to
approach the canonical thermal relic cross section for dark matter particle
masses below ~100 GeV in the bottom quark annihilation channel.

Multicellular systems are extremely sensitive to their environment and while
the limits to multicellular sensing are becoming known, how this information

computational model of multicellular sensing and migration in which groups of

optimal cluster size for most efficient migration. We discuss how our model

dramatic variation of the triggered surface plasmon near the metal, the

spectrum can be switched between the Mollow triplet and a single peak, and the
fluorescence characterized by the antibunching in the second-order correlation
function can be changed from the weak to the strong radiation regime. Our
result is instructive for utilizing the unique mesoscopic effects to develop

utilization of vertical freedom of three dimension (3D) channels are two
critical issues in the limited feedback design of the \emph{full dimension

effective limited feedback scheme. We first employ Kronecker product based
codebook (KPC) to explore the vertical freedom of 3D channels, extending the
limited feedback from two dimension (2D) to 3D. Fruthermore, we use noncoherent
sequence detection (NCSD) to quantify the CSI which includes both the vertical
and horizontal channel information. This quantization method exploits the
duality between codebook searching and NCSD to transform the CSI quntization on
KPC to two parallel NCSD. The complexity is reduced from exponential to linear
with the number of antennas. We also show the proposed scheme does not affect
the diversity gain of the system by demonstrating the full diversity order.
Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides at least
1.2dB coding gain compared with traditional 2D limited feedback schemes.
Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms other FD/3D CSI quantization schemes
by 0.8dB coding gain with moderate complexity when the channel is highly
spatially correlated.

such that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved
without any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining
approximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a
rigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution
equations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice
of full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the
increased accuracy of the RK method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter
for the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally
incurred by the ordinary SPH artificial viscosity. Collectively, we call our
suite of modifications to the traditional SPH scheme Conservative Reproducing
Kernel SPH, or CRKSPH. CRKSPH retains many benefits of traditional SPH methods
(such as preserving Galilean invariance and manifest conservation of mass,
momentum, and energy) while improving on many of the shortcomings of SPH,
particularly the overly aggressive artificial viscosity and zeroth-order
inaccuracy. We compare CRKSPH to two different modern SPH formulations

for complex areas with poor image propagation , such as hole areas or areas of
long and narrow structures. The right results are usually hard to get. On these
areas, if certain flags are provided, it can improve the effects of matting. In
this paper, we design a matting algorithm by local sampling and the KNN
classifier propagation based matting algorithm. First of all, build the
corresponding features space according to the different components of image
colors to reduce the influence of overlapping between the foreground and
background, and to improve the classification accuracy of KNN classifier.
Second, adaptively use local sampling or using local KNN classifier for
processing based on the pros and cons of the sample performance of unknown
image areas. Finally, based on different treatment methods for the unknown
areas, we will use different weight for augmenting constraints to make the
treatment more effective. In this paper, by combining qualitative observation
and quantitative analysis, we will make evaluation of the experimental results
through online standard set of evaluation tests. It shows that on images with
good propagation , this method is as effective as the Closed Form method, while
on images in complex regions, it can perform even better than Closed Form.

Furthermore, the aox distribution of low-L/Ledd AGN displays an X-ray weak tail

between -2<log L/Ledd<-0.1, there is no systematic change in the structure of

the accuracy of current bolometric luminosity estimates for our low-L/Ledd
objects with new Chandra observations, and it is plausible that their Eddington
ratios could be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude. If so, then in
analogy with weak emission line quasars, we suggest that accretion from a
geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient `slim disk' could explain their
diverse properties in aox. Alternatively, if current Eddington ratios are in
fact correct (or overestimated), then the X-ray weak tail would imply that
there is diversity in disk/corona couplings among individual low-mass objects.
Finally, we conclude by noting that the aox distribution for low-mass black

being driven by AGN.

symmetries remain unknown. Here we utilize a very simple model of hypothetical
self-replicating polymers to show that asymmetric autocatalytic polymers are
more successful in self-replication compared to their symmetric counterparts in
the Darwinian competition for space and common substrates. This broken-symmetry
property, called asymmetric cooperativity, arises with the maximization of a
replication potential, where the catalytic influence of inter-strand bonds on
their left and right neighbors is unequal. Asymmetric cooperativity also leads
to tentative, qualitative and simple evolution-based explanations for a number
of other properties of DNA that include four nucleotide alphabet, three

orientation, heteromolecular base-pairing, asymmetric base compositions, and
palindromic instability, apart from the structural asymmetries mentioned above.

with three main contributions. First, we prove that for instance-dependent

that for a broad class of instance- and label-dependent noise, a similar

login mechanism using which a terminal (e.g., a desktop computer) can be
unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone).
Given its appealing usability, ZIA has already been deployed in many real-world
applications. However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized
physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the
attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.
  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by
(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she
approaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is
believed to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the
token to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based
biometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application
settings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors
available on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and
magnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an
""in-pocket"" smartphone and a ""wrist-worn"" smartwatch), that all capture unique
facets of user's walking pattern. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we
introduce, design and implement WUZIA (""Walk-Unlock ZIA""), a multi-modal
walking biometrics approach tailored to enhance the security of ZIA systems

degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion.
Third, we show that WUZIA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a

of determining the commodity groups that are time-dependent will advance the
current knowledge about the dynamics of co-moving and coherent prices, and can
serve as a basis for multivariate time series analyses. The clustering of
commodity prices was examined using the proposed clustering approach based on
time series models to incorporate the time varying properties of price series
into the clustering scheme. Accordingly, the primary aim in this study was
grouping time series according to the similarity between their Data Generating
Mechanisms (DGMs) rather than comparing pattern similarities in the time series
traces. The approximation to the DGM of each series was accomplished using
threshold autoregressive models, which are recognized for their ability to
represent nonlinear features in time series, such as abrupt changes,
time-irreversibility and regime-shifting behavior. Through the use of the
proposed approach, one can determine and monitor the set of co-moving time
series variables across the time dimension. Furthermore, generating a time
varying commodity price index and sub-indexes can become possible.
Consequently, we conducted a simulation study to assess the effectiveness of
the proposed clustering approach and the results are presented for both the

Remarkably, we demonstrate that the proposed coherence quantifier is not only a
measure of mixedness, but also an intrinsic (basis-independent) quantification
of quantum coherence contained in quantum states, which can also be viewed as a
normalized version of Brukner-Zeilinger invariant information. In our context,
the asymmetry of N-qubit quantum systems is considered under local independent

processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations,
stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced

estimate the position of a radiating source, the diagonal loading of the

accuracy and localization robustness. This paper proposes a diagonal unloading
(DU) method which extends the conventional response power beamforming method by
imposing an additional constraint to the covariance matrix of the array output
vector. The regularization is obtained by subtracting a given amount of white
noise from the main diagonal of the covariance matrix. Specifically, the DU
beamformer aims at subtracting the signal subspace from the noisy signal space
and it is computed by constraining the regularized covariance matrix to be
negative definite. It is hence a data-dependent covariance matrix conditioning
method. We show how to calculate precisely the unloading parameter, and we
present an eigenvalue analysis for comparing the proposed DU beamforming, the
minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter and the multiple signal
classification (MUSIC) method. Theoretical analysis and experiments with
acoustic sources demonstrate that the DU beamformer localization performance is
comparable to that of MVDR and MUSIC. Since the DU beamformer computational
cost is comparable to that of a conventional beamformer, the proposed method
can be attractive in array processing due to its simplicity, effectiveness and
computational efficiency.

impact of area level risk factors on health outcomes when data are only

biased due to unmeasured confounders, which typically are not available from
the standard administrative registries used for these studies. Extra
information on confounders can be provided through external datasets such as
surveys or cohorts, where the data are available at the individual level rather
than at the area level; however such data typically lack the geographical
coverage of administrative registries. We develop a framework of analysis which
combines ecological and individual level data from different sources to provide
an adjusted estimate of area level risk factors which is less biased. Our
method (i) summarises all available individual level confounders into an area
level scalar variable, which we call ecological propensity score (EPS), (ii)
implements a hierarchical structured approach to predict the values of EPS
whenever they are missing, (iii) includes the estimated and predicted EPS into
the ecological regression linking the risk factors to the health outcome.
Through a simulation study we show that integrating individual level data into
small area analyses via EPS is a promising method to reduce the bias intrinsic
in ecological studies due to unmeasured confounders; we also apply the method
to a real case study to evaluate the effect of air pollution on coronary heart

of the rotor swept area to the land area (for each turbine) and $C_{f0}$ is a
natural friction coefficient observed before constructing the farm. When
$\lambda/C_{f0}$ approaches to zero, the new theory goes back to the classical
actuator disc theory, yielding the well-known Betz limit. When $\lambda/C_{f0}$
increases to a large value, the maximum power coefficient of each turbine
reduces whilst a normalised power density of the farm increases asymptotically
to an upper limit. A CFD analysis of an infinitely large wind farm with

on the ratio of the beam intensities and a single parameter describing

an alternative mechanism, driven by thermal excitation over the anisotropy
energy barrier and a difference in the energy absorption depending on

an ensemble of single domain grains. Only a small difference in the absorption
is required to reach magnetization levels observed experimentally and the model
does not preclude the role of the inverse Faraday effect but removes the
necessity that the opto-magnetic field is 10s of Tesla in strength.

many of these sources these are the first broadband studies. We use a Bayesian
block analysis of \Fermi/LAT light curves in order to determine time ranges of
constant flux for constructing quasi-simultaneous SEDs. The shapes of the
resulting 81 SEDs are described by two logarithmic parabolas and a blackbody
spectrum where needed. For low states the peak frequencies and luminosities
agree well with the blazar sequence, higher luminosity implying lower peak
frequencies. This is not true for sources in a high state. The $\gamma$-ray
photon index in Fermi/LAT correlates with the synchrotron peak frequency in low
and intermediate states. No correlation is present in high states. The black
hole mass cannot be determined from the SEDs. Surprisingly, the thermal excess
often found in FSRQs at optical/UV wavelengths can be described by blackbody
emission and not an accretion disk spectrum. The ""harder-when-brighter"" trend,
typically seen in X-ray spectra of flaring blazars, is visible in the blazar
sequence. Our results for low and intermediate states, as well as the Compton
dominance, are in agreement with previous results. Black hole mass estimates
using the parameters from Bonchi (2013) are in agreement with some of the more
direct measurements. For two sources, estimates disagree by more than four
orders of magnitude, possibly due to boosting effects. The shapes of the

polarization of the edge currents in a honeycomb lattice with the
Haldane-Rashba interaction. This interaction breaks the time-reversal symmetry
due to the Haldane phase caused by a current loop at site-I and -II atoms and
also accounts for the Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. The Rashba spin-orbit
interaction increases the number of Dirac points and the band-touching
phenomenon can be generated by tuning the on-site potential in the non-zero
Haldane phase. By using the Pontryagin winding number and numerical Berry
curvature methods, we find that the Chern number pattern is $\{+2, -1, 0\}$ and
$\{-2, +1, 0\}$ for the positive and negative Haldane phase, respectively. A
non-zero Chern number is called a Chern-insulating phase. We discovered that
changes in both the Haldane phase and on-site potential leads to a change in
the orientation of the bulk spin polarization of site-I and site-II atoms.
Interestingly, in a ribbon with a zigzag edge, which naturally has site-I atoms
at one outer edge and site-II atoms at the opposite outer edge, the spin
polarization of the edge states approximately obeys the properties of bulk spin
polarization regardless of the change in the Chern number. In addition, even
when the Chern number changes from $+2$ to $-1$ (or $-2$ to $+1$), by tuning
the strength of the on-site potential, the sign of the spin polarization of the
edge states persists. This approximate bulk-edge correspondence of the spin
polarization in the Haldane-Rashba system would play an important role in
spintronics, because it enables us to control the orientation of the spin
polarization in a single Chern-insulating phase.

focusing on the description of small Be chains via standard quantum chemical
methods and gave a brief analysis of the main characteristics of their wave

the Be6 ring. First, the complete active space formalism (CAS-MoI) was employed
and the results were used as reference for local MR calculations of the whole

calculation of systems with limited multireference character, its application
to the description of whole dissociation curves still requires further testing.
After discussing the role of the basis set, the method was finally applied to
larger rings and extrapolated to an infinite chain.

and its propagation characteristics in the absence and presence of a floating
cylindrical object are investigated. The experiments are carried out in a
direct current (DC) glow discharge dusty plasma in the background of argon gas.
Dust particles are found levitated at the interface of plasma and cathode
sheath region. The DAWs are spontaneously excited in the dust medium and found
to propagate in the direction of ion drift (along the gravity) above a
threshold discharge current at lower pressure. The excitation of such low
frequency wave is a result of the ion--dust streaming instability in the dust
cloud. The characteristics of the propagating dust acoustic wave get modified
in presence of a floating cylindrical object of radius larger than the dust
Debye length. Instead of propagating in the vertical direction, the DAWs are
found to propagate obliquely in presence of the floating object (kept either
vertically or horizontally). In addition, horizontally aligned floating object
gives rise to form a wave structure in the cone shaped dust cloud in the sheath
region. The change in the propagation characteristics of DAWs are explained on
the basis of modified potential (or electric field) distribution, which is a
consequence of coupling of sheaths formed around the cylindrical object and the
cathode.

Molecular-Dynamics simulations the fast mobility - the rattling amplitude of
the particles temporarily trapped by the cage of the neighbors - in mildly
supercooled states of dense molecular (linear trimers) and atomic (binary
mixtures) liquids. The mixture particles interact by the Lennard-Jones
potential. The non-bonded particles of the molecular system are coupled by the
more general Mie potential with variable repulsive and attractive exponents in
a range which is characteristic of small $n$-alkanes and $n$-alcohols. Possible
links between the fast mobility and the geometry of the cage (size and shape)
are searched. The correlations on a per-particle basis are rather weak.
Instead, if one groups either the particles in fast-mobility subsets or the
cages in geometric subsets, the increase of the fast mobility with both the
size and the asphericity of the cage is revealed. The observed correlations are
weak and differ in states with equal relaxation time. Local forces between a
tagged particle and the first-neighbor shell do not correlate with the fast
mobility in the molecular liquid. It is concluded that the cage geometry alone
is unable to provide a microscopic interpretation of the known, universal link
between the fast mobility and the slow structural relaxation. We suggest that
the particle fast dynamics is affected by regions beyond the first neighbours,
thus supporting the presence of collective, extended fast modes.

an estimator based on a ratio of realized power variations. Our new resampling
method, the local fractional bootstrap, relies on simulating an auxiliary
fractional Brownian motion that mimics the fine properties of high frequency
differences of the Brownian semistationary process under the null hypothesis.
We prove the first order validity of the bootstrap method and in simulations we
observe that the bootstrap-based hypothesis test provides considerable
finite-sample improvements over an existing test that is based on a central
limit theorem. This is important when studying the roughness properties of time
series data; we illustrate this by applying the bootstrap method to two
empirical data sets: we assess the roughness of a time series of high-frequency
asset prices and we test the validity of Kolmogorov's scaling law in
atmospheric turbulence data.

backhaul of limited capacity (i.e. imperfect case). Under this setting, we
characterize in this paper the stability region of the system under both the
imperfect and perfect (i.e. unlimited backhaul) cases, then we examine the gap
between these two resulting regions. Further, under each case, we provide a
centralized probing algorithm (policy) that achieves the max stability region.
These stability regions and scheduling policies are given for the symmetric

for the general system. For the symmetric system, we compare the stability
region of IA with the one achieved by a time division multiple access (TDMA)
system where each transmitter applies a simple singular value decomposition
technique (SVD). We then propose a scheduling policy that consists in switching
between these two techniques, leading the system, under some conditions, to
achieve a bigger stability region. Under the general system, the adopted
scheduling policy is of a high computational complexity for moderate number of
pairs, consequently we propose an approximate policy that has a reduced
complexity but that achieves only a fraction of the system stability region. A

around the vacuum, which applies to a regime where the number of excitations
per site is small; a 'soft' cutoff which corresponds to an expansion around

much thinner film undergoes a shear-driven long-wavelength deformation.
Although the lubricating film should reduce the viscous stresses acting on the
up to one hundred times thicker upper layer by only 10%, it is found that the
critical Marangoni number of marginal stability may be as low as if a
stress-free boundary condition were applied at the bottom of the upper layer,
i.e. much lower than the classical value of 79.6 known for a single film.
Furthermore, it is experimentally verified that the deformation of the
liquid-liquid interface, albeit small, has a non-negligible effect on the
temperature distribution along the liquid-gas interface of the upper layer.
This stabilizes the hexagonal pattern symmetry towards external disturbances
and indicates a two-way coupling of the different layers. The experiments also
demonstrate how convection patterns formed in a liquid film can be used to
pattern a second conjugated film. The experimental findings are verified by a

respect to both the state variables and the parameters. Taking into account the
physical constraints of the problem, one needs to classify, with respect to the

semi-algebraic set. We develop a dedicated algorithm for real root
classification of the singularities of the rank defects of a polynomial matrix,
cut with a given semi-algebraic set. The algorithm works under some genericity

for real root classification do, our algorithm needs to compute the critical
loci of some maps, intersections with the boundary of the semi-algebraic

exploited through a stratifi-cation by the rank of the polynomial matrix. This
speeds up the computations by a factor 100. Furthermore, our implementation is
able to solve the application in medical imagery, which was out of reach of
more general algorithms for real root classification. For instance,
computational results show that the contrast problem where one of the matters

that each edge is incident to at least one vertex in that set. Interestingly,
the computational complexity of the minimum vertex covering problem in graphs
is closely related to the core percolation problem, where the core is a special
subgraph obtained by the greedy leaf removal procedure. Here, by generalizing
the greedy leaf removal procedure in graphs to hypergraphs, we introduce two
generalizations of core percolation in graphs to hypergraphs, related to the

hypergraphs, respectively. We offer analytical solutions of these two core
percolations for random hypergraphs with arbitrary vertex degree and hyperedge

Cluster-tools are widely used to automate single wafer processing in
semiconductor industry. The load locks are the entry points into the vacuum of
the Cluster-tool's mainframe. Usually there are two of them available. Each lot
being processed, is dedicated to a single load-lock. Therefore at most two
different lots (with possibly different processing times and qualification) can
be processed simultaneously. This restriction is one of the major potential
bottlenecks.
  Capacity planning is one of the possible applications for the proposed model
and the paper demonstrates the integration into a more general framework that
considers different tool types and different operational modes.
  The paper also generalizes an earlier model that is limited to three
processing chambers. The proposed modeling approach is based on makespan
reductions by parallel processing. It turns out that the performance of the new
approach is similar, when compared to the generalized model for three chambers,
but the new approach outperforms the generalized model for four and more

photometry and spectroscopy and, for two sources, archival Swift observations.
SDSSJ0328 was X-ray bright in two XMM and two Swift observations, and shows
transitions from high and low accretion states over a few months. It has no
strong soft excess. We measured the magnetic field strength at the main pole to
be 39 MG, the inclination to be 45<i<77 deg, and we have refined the long-term
ephemeris. SDSSJ1333 was X-ray faint. We measured a faint phase X-ray flux and
plasma temperature for this source, which spends almost all of its time
accreting at a low level. Its inclination is less than about 76 degrees.
1RXSJ1730 was X-ray bright in the XMM data. Its spectrum contained a modest
soft blackbody component, not luminous enough to be considered a strong soft
excess. We inferred a magnetic field strength at the main pole of 20 to 25 MG,
and that the inclination is less than 77 and probably less than 63 deg. V808
Aur was faint in the Swift observation but there is still strong evidence for
bright and faint phases in X-rays and perhaps in UV. Residual X-ray flux from
the faint phase is hard to explain by thermal emission from the WD surface, or
by accretion onto the other pole. We give a revised distance estimate of 250pc.
  The three systems we could study in detail appear to be normal polars, with
luminosity and magnetic field strength typical for this class of CV. None of
these systems shows the strong soft excess thought commonplace in polars prior
to the XMM era.

it is very challenging to use tunneling between classical islands centered on
fixed points with opposite momentum. We show that it is more promising to use
islands symmetric in position space, and characterize the regime where it could
be done. The proposed experiment could be realized with current

critical. First an unexpected excess response of detectors at low optical
excitation frequency for {\nu} < 1 Hz, and secondly the Analog To digital
Converter (ADC) component had been insufficiently characterized on-ground.
These two problems require an exquisite knowledge of detector response. However
bolometers have highly nonlinear characteristics, coming from their electrical
and thermal coupling making them very difficult to modelize.
  Goal: We present a method to build the analytical transfer function in
frequency domain which describe the voltage response of an Alternative Current
(AC) biased bolometer to optical excitation, based on the standard bolometer
model. This model is built using the setup of the Planck/HFI instrument and
offers the major improvement of being based on a physical model rather than the
currently in use had-hoc model based on Direct Current (DC) bolometer theory.
  Method: The analytical transfer function expression will be presented in
matrix form. For this purpose, we build linearized versions of the bolometer
electro thermal equilibrium. And a custom description of signals in frequency
is used to solve the problem with linear algebra. The model performances is
validated using time domain simulations.
  Results: The provided expression is suitable for calibration and data
process- ing. It can also be used to provide constraints for fitting optical
transfer function using real data from steady state electronic response and
optical response. The accurate description of electronic response can also be
used to improve the ADC nonlinearity correction for quickly varying optical
signals.

rotation between the moments of certain subsequent planes is essentially
quenched. It is the magnetization of pairs of planes which rotates when moving
along a <111> axis, thus preserving the overall helical structure.

terrestrial planet regime induced through tidal interaction with a
protoplanetary disk assuming that this is the dominant mechanism for producing
orbital migration and circularization. We develop a simple analytic model for a
system that maintains consecutive pairs in resonance while undergoing orbital
circularization and migration. Migration times for each planet may be estimated
once planet masses, circularization times and the migration time for the
innermost planet are given. We applied it to a model system with the current
architecture of Kepler 444 interacting with a protoplanetary disk, the
evolution time for the system as a whole being comparable to current
protoplanetary disk lifetimes.
  In addition we performed numerical simulations with input data obtained from
this model. These indicate that although the analytic model is inexact,
relatively small corrections to estimated migration rates yield systems for
which period ratios vary by a minimal extent. Because of relatively large
deviations from exact resonance in the observed system of up to $2\%,$ the
migration times obtained in this way indicate only weak convergent migration
such that a system for which the planets did not interact would contract by
only $\sim 1\%$ although undergoing significant inward migration as a whole. We
performed additional simulations to investigate how the system could undergo
significant convergent migration before reaching its final state. These
indicate migration times have to be significantly shorter and resonances
significantly closer. Relative migration rates would then have to decrease
allowing period ratios to increase to become more distant from resonances as
the system approached its final state in the inner regions of the
protoplanetary disk (abridged).

numerical methods available for many-body systems. In this work, we develop a
perturbation theory of DMRG (PT-DMRG) to largely increase its accuracy in an
extremely simple and efficient way. By using the canonical matrix product state
(MPS) representation for the ground state of the considered system, a set of
orthogonal basis functions $\left\lbrace | \psi_i \rangle \right\rbrace$ is
introduced to describe the perturbations to the ground state obtained by the
conventional DMRG. The Schmidt numbers of the MPS that are beyond the bond
dimension cut-off are used to define such perturbation terms. The perturbed
Hamiltonian is then defined as $\tilde{H}_{ij}= \langle \psi_i | \hat{H} |
\psi_j \rangle$; its ground state permits to calculate physical observables
with a considerably improved accuracy as compared to the original DMRG results.
We benchmark the second-order perturbation theory with the help of
one-dimensional Ising chain in a transverse field and the Heisenberg chain,
where the precision of DMRG is shown to be improved $\rm O(10)$ times.
Furthermore, for moderate length $L$ the errors of DMRG and PT-DMRG both scale
linearly with $L^{-1}$. The linear relation between the dimension cut-off of
DMRG and that of PT-DMRG with the same precision shows a considerable
improvement of efficiency, especially for large dimension cut-off's. In
thermodynamic limit we show that the errors of PT-DMRG scale with
$\sqrt{L^{-1}}$. Our work suggests an effective way to define the tangent space
of the ground state MPS, which may shed lights on the properties beyond the
ground state. Such second-order PT-DMRG can be readily generalized to higher
orders, as well as applied to the models in higher dimensions.

materials. In this study, carbon thin and thick films are discussed for
different techniques known as hot filament chemical vapor deposition and
microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition where their synthesis process has

tiny grains amalgamating into a particular phase of grain or crystallite and
electron-dynamics responsible for binding atoms in the formation of all sorts

Carbon atoms when in solid state, on amalgamation at flat surface result into
bind under uniform electron-dynamics and when the amalgamation is at uneven

under appropriate surface defects or abrasion result into an improved rate of
nucleation of tiny grains, hence, their increased rate of growth. This study
embarks on unexplored science of carbon films where in addition to localized
process parameters nature of substrate also influence dynamics of formation of
tiny clusters, grains and crystallites at their initial stage of formation. Our

fields is investigated. Special focus is placed on transport across the mean
magnetic field, which had been found to be subdiffusive on many occasions.
Therefore, a characterization using the concept of ergodicity is attempted by
noting the connection to the time evolution of the mean-square displacement.
Methods. Based on the test-particle approach, a numerical Monte-Carlo
simulation code is used to integrate the equation of motion for particles that
are scattered by magnetic turbulence. The turbulent fields are generated by
superposing plane waves with a Kolmogorov-type power spectrum. The individual
particle trajectories are then used to calculate a variety of statistical
quantities. Results. The simulation results clearly demonstrate how the
heterogeneity of the particle ensemble causes the system to be weakly
non-ergodic. In addition, it is shown how the step length distribution varies
with the particle energy. In conclusion, cross-field transport is non-Gaussian
but still almost diffusive.

microwave emission can be detected directly from the acceleration region when
the trapped electron component is insignificant. For the statistical study
reported here, we have identified events with steep (narrowband) microwave
spectra that do not show a significant trapped component and at the same time
show evidence of source uniformity, which simplifies the data analysis greatly.
Initially, we identified a subset of more than 20 radio bursts with such narrow
spectra, having low- and high-frequency spectral indices larger than 3 in
absolute value. A steep low-frequency spectrum implies that the emission is
nonthermal (for optically-thick thermal emission, the spectral index cannot be
steeper than 2), and the source is reasonably dense and uniform. A steep
high-frequency spectrum implies that no significant electron trapping occurs;
otherwise a progressive spectral flattening would be observed. Roughly half of
these radio bursts have RHESSI data, which allows for detailed, joint
diagnostics of the source parameters and evolution. Based on an analysis of
radio-to-X-ray spatial relationships, timing, and spectral fits, we conclude
that the microwave emission in these narrowband bursts originates directly from
the acceleration regions, which have relatively strong magnetic field, high
density, and low temperature. In contrast, the thermal X-ray emission comes
from a distinct loop with smaller magnetic field, lower density, but higher
temperature. Therefore, these flares occurred likely due to interaction between
two (or more) magnetic loops.

they admit localizations in the form of measure-valued valuations. For these

theorem has been proved recently, under the assumption of isometry covariance,

transistors (TFETs). Here, we report design and performance of strained
ultra-thin-body (UTB) III-V TFETs by quantum transport simulations. It is found
that for an InAs UTB confined in [001] orientation, uniaxial compressive strain
in [100] or [110] orientation shrinks the band gap meanwhile reduces
(increases) transport (transverse) effective masses. Thus it improves the ON
state current of both n-type and p-type UTB InAs TFETs without lowering the
source density of states. Applying the strain locally in the source region
makes further improvements by suppressing the OFF state leakage. For p-type
TFETs, the locally strained area can be extended into the channel to form a
quantum well, giving rise to even larger ON state current that is comparable to
the n-type ones. Therefore strain engineering is a promising option for
improving complementary circuits based on UTB III-V TFETs.

  consumption? A systematic review of the literature","Accepted for oral presentation at the 3rd International NILM
  Workshop, Vancouver, 14-15 May 2016",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine 12 studies on the efficacy of disaggregated energy feedback. The
average electricity reduction across these studies is 4.5%. However, 4.5% may
be a positively-biased estimate of the savings achievable across the entire
population because all 12 studies are likely to be prone to opt-in bias hence
none test the effect of disaggregated feedback on the general population.
Disaggregation may not be required to achieve these savings: Aggregate feedback
alone drives 3% reductions; and the 4 studies which directly compared aggregate
feedback against disaggregated feedback found that aggregate feedback is at
least as effective as disaggregated feedback, possibly because web apps are
viewed less often than in-home-displays (in the short-term, at least) and
because some users do not trust fine-grained disaggregation (although this may
be an issue with the specific user interface studied). Disaggregated
electricity feedback may help a motivated sub-group of the population to save
more energy but fine-grained disaggregation may not be necessary to achieve
these energy savings. Disaggregation has many uses beyond those discussed in
this paper but, on the specific question of promoting energy reduction in the
general population, there is no robust evidence that current forms of
disaggregated energy feedback are more effective than aggregate energy
feedback. The effectiveness of disaggregated feedback may increase if the
general population become more energy-conscious (e.g. if energy prices rise or
concern about climate change deepens); or if users' trust in fine-grained
disaggregation improves; or if innovative new approaches or alternative
disaggregation strategies (e.g. disaggregating by behaviour rather than by
appliance) out-perform existing feedback. We also discuss opportunities for new
research into the effectiveness of disaggregated feedback.

said to be interdependent if the operation of one network depends on the
operation of the other one, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a model
for analyzing bidirectional interdependent networks with known topology. We
define the metric MR(D) to be the minimum number of nodes that should be
removed from one network to cause the failure of D nodes in the other network
due to cascading failures. We prove that evaluating this metric is not only
NP-complete, but also inapproximable. Next, we propose heuristics for
evaluating this metric and compare their performances using simulation results.
Finally, we introduce two closely related definitions for robust design of
interdependent networks; propose algorithms for explicit design, and
demonstrate the relation between robust interdependent networks and expander

Generally speaking, there are more than one unknown x in this multivariate
function and it is not easy to reduce the number of unknown x to one. In this
paper we achieve this by introducing function promotion which can converse a
function of less variables to one of more variables and by introducing
multivariate function composition developed from unary function composition. We
introduced inverse multivariate functions extended from inverse unary functions
then we can express the solution by an inverse multivariate function if this
equivalent multivariate function is invertible. For an equivalent irreversible
multivariate function we introduced relation and consider the equivalent
multivariate function as a special multivariate relation then we can express
the solution by an inverse multivariate relation which always exists. No one
will belief that every one is familiar with multivariate function composition
after their reading this paper and knowing the importance of multivariate
function composition to express the solution of a general equation. Further
more we discuss the possibility of expressing the solution, a multivariate

oxygen in the plasma treatment is essential to significantly enhance the gas
response of Rh-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes and to avoid response
saturation even at low gas/vapor concentrations. These desirable effects are
attributed to the presence of oxygen during the CNT plasma treatment since
oxygenated vacancies act both as active adsorption sites for gases and as
anchoring sites for Rh nanoparticles (the presence of Rh nanoclusters is nearly
doubled in Ar-O$_2$ treated samples as compared to Ar treated samples). The
oxygen treatment also makes easier the charge transfer between Rh nanoparticles
and carbon nanotubes upon gas adsorption. The method for treating and
