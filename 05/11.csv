under gene flow. Empirical data show that divergence is mostly concentrated in
narrow genomic regions. This pattern may arise because differentiated loci
protect nearby mutations from gene flow, but recent theory suggests this
mechanism is insufficient to explain the emergence of concentrated
differentiation during biologically realistic timescales. Critically, earlier
theory neglects an inevitable consequence of genetic drift: stochastic loss of
local genomic divergence. Here we demonstrate that the rate of stochastic loss
of weak local differentiation increases with recombination distance to a
strongly diverged locus and, above a critical recombination distance, local
loss is faster than local `gain' of new differentiation. Under high migration
and weak selection this critical recombination distance is much smaller than
the total recombination distance of the genomic region under selection.
Consequently, divergence between populations increases by net gain of new
differentiation within the critical recombination distance, resulting in
tightly-linked clusters of divergence. The mechanism responsible is the balance
between stochastic loss and gain of weak local differentiation, a mechanism
acting universally throughout the genome. Our results will help to explain
empirical observations and lead to novel predictions regarding changes in
genomic architectures during adaptive divergence.

thermal emission lines of gaseous sodium chloride (NaCl) are present at high

contribution of up to four different spatial regions. The NaCl emission pattern
is different compared to the dust continuum and TiO2 emission already analysed
from the ALMA SV data. The emission can be reconciled with an axisymmetric
geometry, where the lower density polar/rotation axis has a position angle of
~50 degrees measured from north to east. However, this picture can not capture
the full morphological diversity, and discrete mass ejection events need to be
invoked to explain localized higher-density regions. The velocity traced by the
gaseous NaCl line profiles is significantly lower than the average wind
terminal velocity, and much slower than some of the fastest mass ejections,
signalling a wide range of characteristic speeds for the mass loss. Gaseous
NaCl is detected far beyond the main dust condensation region. Realising the
refractory nature of this metal halide, this hints at a chemical process
preventing all NaCl from condensing onto dust grains. We show that in the case
of the ratio of the surface binding temperature to the grain temperature being
~50, only some 10% of NaCl remains in gaseous form, while for lower values of
this ratio thermal desorption efficiently evaporates NaCl. Photodesorption by
stellar photons seems not to be a viable explanation for the detection of
gaseous NaCl at 220 Rstar from the central star, and instead, we propose
shock-induced sputtering driven by localized mass ejection events as
alternative.

Various approaches to this basic question have been considered. Here we propose
a particularly compelling and natural mechanism for preserving stability of
learning neural systems. This mechanism is based on the global processes by
which metabolic resources are distributed to the neurons by glial cells.
Specifically, we introduce and study a model comprised of two interacting
networks: a model neural network interconnected by synapses which undergo
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP); and a model glial network
interconnected by gap junctions which diffusively transport metabolic resources
among the glia and, ultimately, to neural synapses where they are consumed. Our
main result is that the biophysical constraints imposed by diffusive transport
of metabolic resources through the glial network can prevent runaway growth of
synaptic strength, both during ongoing activity and during learning. Our
findings suggest a previously unappreciated role for glial transport of
metabolites in the feedback control stabilization of neural network dynamics

large scales). However, as $Re$ increases, the growth-rate is found to saturate
and most of the energy is found at small scales. In the absence of \AKA{}

with a negative eddy-viscosity scaling $\sigma \propto \nu(b Re^2-1) q^2$. The
instability appears only above a critical value of the Reynolds number
$Re^{c}$. For values of $Re$ above a second critical value $Re^{c}_{S}$ beyond
which small-scale instabilities are present, the growth-rate becomes
independent of $q$ and the energy of the perturbation at large scales decreases
with scale separation. A simple two-modes model is derived that well describes
the behaviors of energy concentration and growth-rates of various unstable

  Stochastic Volatility Model",,,,,"math.AP q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use commutator techniques and calculations in solvable Lie groups to
investigate certain evolution Partial Differential Equations (PDEs for short)
that arise in the study of stochastic volatility models for pricing contingent
claims on risky assets. In particular, by restricting to domains of bounded
volatility, we establish the existence of the semi-groups generated by the
spatial part of the operators in these models, concentrating on those arising
in the so-called ""SABR stochastic volatility model with mean reversion."" The
main goal of this work is to approximate the solutions of the Cauchy problem
for the SABR PDE with mean reversion, a parabolic problem the generator of
which is denoted by $L$. The fundamental solution for this problem is not known
in closed form. We obtain an approximate solution by performing an expansion in
the so-called volvol or volatility of the volatility, which leads us to study a
degenerate elliptic operator $L_0$, corresponding the the zero-volvol case of
the SABR model with mean reversion, to which the classical results do not
apply. However, using Lie algebra techniques we are able to derive an exact
formula for the solution operator of the PDE $\partial_t u - L_0 u = 0$. We
then compare the semi-group generated by $L$--the existence of which does
follows from standard arguments--to that generated by $L_0$, thus establishing
a perturbation result that is useful for numerical methods for the SABR PDE
with mean reversion. In the process, we are led to study semigroups arising
from both a strongly parabolic and a hyperbolic problem.

It is proposed that the dominant helical coherent structure can be suppressed

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the breakdown region of
isothermal and heated swirling jets. The coherent kinetic energy of the
dominant helical structure was derived from PIV snapshots via Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition. For one set of experimental parameters, mild heating is found to
increase the energy content of the dominant helical mode. Strong heating leads
to a reduction by 30\% of the coherent structures energy. For a second set of
experimental parameters, no alteration of the dominant coherent structure is
detectable. Local linear stability analysis of the time-averaged velocity
fields shows that the key difference between the two configurations is the
density ratio at the respective wavemaker location. A density ratio of
approximately 0.8 is found to correlate to a suppression of the global mode in
the experiments. A parametric study with model density and velocity profiles
indicates the most important parameters that govern the local absolute growth
rate: The density ratio and the relative position of the density profiles and

study shows that a single Galactic component with subsequent energy cut-offs in
the individual spectra of different elements, optimised to explain the observed
spectra below ~10^14 eV and the knee in the all-particle spectrum, cannot
explain the observed all-particle spectrum above ~2x10^16 eV. We discuss two
approaches for a second component of Galactic cosmic rays -- re-acceleration at
a Galactic wind termination shock, and supernova explosions of Wolf-Rayet
stars, and show that the latter scenario can explain almost all observed
features in the all-particle spectrum and the composition up to ~10^18 eV, when
combined with a canonical extra-galactic spectrum expected from strong radio
galaxies or a source population with similar cosmological evolution. In this
two-component Galactic model, the knee at ~ 3x10^15 eV and the second knee at
~10^17 eV in the all-particle spectrum are due to the cut-offs in the first and
second components, respectively. We also discuss several variations of the
extra-galactic component, from a minimal contribution to scenarios with a
significant component below the ankle (at ~4x10^18 eV), and find that
extra-galactic contributions in excess of regular source evolution are neither
indicated nor in conflict with the existing data. Our main result is that the
second Galactic component predicts a composition of Galactic cosmic rays at and
above the second knee that largely consists of helium or a mixture of helium
and CNO nuclei, with a weak or essentially vanishing iron fraction, in contrast
to most common assumptions. This prediction is in agreement with new
measurements from LOFAR and the Pierre Auger Observatory which indicate a
strong light component and a rather low iron fraction between ~10^17 and 10^18

continuous authentication regime. Instead of simply returning authentication
probabilities or confidence scores, CALIPER's CAS uses live hard and soft
biometric samples from the user to extract a cryptographic private key embedded
in a challenge posed by the CAVE. The CAS then uses this key to sign a response
to the CAVE. CALIPER supports multiple modalities, key lengths, and security
levels and can be applied in two scenarios: One where the CAS must authenticate
its user to a CAVE running on a remote server (device-server) for access to
remote application data, and another where the CAS must authenticate its user
to a locally running trusted computing module (TCM) for access to local
application data (device-TCM). We further demonstrate that CALIPER can leverage
device hardware resources to enable privacy and security even when the device's
kernel is compromised, and we show how this authentication protocol can even be

cells, to probe and interact with their environments. Polymerization dynamics
of actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely
determine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization
reactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the
filopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed
ends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle
by cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively
short, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the
bundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate
the effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure
of filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic
simulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in
partial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a
hollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the
activity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament
bundles. Interestingly, electron microscopy experiments on mature filopodia
indeed frequently reveal actin bundles that are narrow at the tip and wider at
the base. Overall, our work demonstrates that excluded volume effects in the
context of reaction-diffusion processes in porous networks may lead to
unexpected geometric growth patterns and complicated, history-dependent
dynamics of intermediate metastable configurations.

drives the Higgs boson mass from the large value in the early universe to the
small value at present, where the Higgs mass is an evolving parameter of the
Universe. Thus, the small Higgs mass can technically originate from the
cosmological evolution rather than dynamical symmetry or anthropics. Further,
we study the possible collider signals or constraints at future lepton collier

extended non-relativistic quantum formalism where space and time play
equivalent roles. It leads to the probability of finding a particle between $x$
and $x+dx$ during [$t$,$t+dt$]. Then, we find a Schr\""odinger-like equation for
a ""mirror"" wave function $\phi(t,x)$ associated with the probability of
measuring the system between $t$ and $t+dt$, given that detection occurs at
$x$. In this framework, it is shown that energy measurements of a stationary
state display a non-zero dispersion, and that energy-time uncertainty arises
from first principles. We show that a central result on arrival time, obtained
through approaches that resort to {\it ad hoc} assumptions, is a natural,
built-in part of the formalism presented here.

causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling
topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading
diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from
their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear
dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent
to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which
account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The
advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for
nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put
forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a
convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to
proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with
complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction
method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted
on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs
with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene
expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by
linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes.

appealing because it is minimally invasive yet offers relatively good
recognition performance. Unfortunately, the combination of weak supervision and
minimal invasiveness makes even highly accurate facial recognition systems
susceptible to spoofing via presentation attacks. Thus, there is great demand
for an effective and low cost system capable of rejecting such attacks.To this
end we introduce PARAPH -- a novel hardware extension that exploits different
measurements of light polarization to yield an image space in which
presentation media are readily discernible from Bona Fide facial
characteristics. The PARAPH system is inexpensive with an added cost of less
than 10 US dollars. The system makes two polarization measurements in rapid
succession, allowing them to be approximately pixel-aligned, with a frame rate
limited by the camera, not the system. There are no moving parts above the
molecular level, due to the efficient use of twisted nematic liquid crystals.
We present evaluation images using three presentation attack media next to an
actual face -- high quality photos on glossy and matte paper and a video of the
face on an LCD. In each case, the actual face in the image generated by PARAPH
is structurally discernible from the presentations, which appear either as
noise (print attacks) or saturated images (replay attacks).

spectroscopy and both neutron and non-resonant x-ray scattering serve as
effective probes for determining the behavior of appropriate, individual

phonon dispersion, respectively. However, each provides less direct information
about the mutual coupling between the degrees of freedom, usual through
self-energy effects, which tend to renormalize and broaden spectral features

characterize the coupling. Here we demonstrate that resonant inelastic x-ray

relative strength and momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling in

promising framework in which to develop such methods is network science, which
can be used to translate particle locations and force contacts to a graph in
which particles are represented by nodes and forces between particles are
represented by weighted edges. Applying network-based community-detection
techniques to extract force chains opens the door to developing statistics of
force chain structure, with the goal of identifying shape differences across
packings, and providing a foundation on which to build predictions of bulk
material properties from mesoscale network features. Here, we discuss a trio of
related but fundamentally distinct measurements of mesoscale structure of force
chains in arbitrary 2D packings, including a novel statistic derived using
tools from algebraic topology, which together provide a tool set for the
analysis of force chain architecture. We demonstrate the utility of this tool
set by detecting variations in force chain architecture with pressure.
Collectively, these techniques can be generalized to 3D packings, and to the
assessment of continuous deformations of packings under stress or strain.

2DEG in the studied devices can be interpreted as a plasmonic waveguide where
multiple gate terminals control the 2DEG kinetic inductance. When the gate
tuning of the 2DEG is spatially periodic, a one-dimensional finite plasmonic
crystal forms. This results in a subwavelength structure, much like a
metamaterial element, that nonetheless Bragg scatters plasma waves from a
repeated crystal unit cell. A 50% in situ tuning of the plasmonic crystal band
edges is observed. By introducing gate-controlled defects or simply terminating

identify industrialization as a combination of a monetary index, the GDP per

Fitness. At first we explore these relations on a global scale over the time
period 1990--2008 focusing on two different dimensions of inequality: the
capital share of income and a Theil measure of wage inequality. In both cases,
the movement of inequality follows a pattern similar to the one theorized by
Kuznets in the fifties. We then narrow down the object of study ad we
concentrate on wage inequality within the United States. By employing data on
wages and employment on the approximately 3100 US counties for the time
interval 1990--2014, we generalize the Fitness-Complexity algorithm for
counties and NAICS sectors, and we investigate wage inequality between
industrial sectors within counties. At this scale, in the early nineties we
recover a behavior similar to the global one. While, in more recent years, we
uncover a trend reversal: wage inequality monotonically increases as
industrialization levels grow. Hence at a county level, at net of the social
and institutional factors that differ among countries, we not only observe an
upturn in inequality but also a change in the structure of the relation between
wage inequality and development.

Dehydration, though, yields ion-dependent free-energy barriers and thus is
predicted to give rise to selectivity by itself. However, these barriers are
typically so large that they will suppress the ion currents to undetectable

dehydration-based selectivity functions for all ions, i.e., cation over cation
selectivity (e.g., $\mathrm{K}^+$ over $\mathrm{Na}^+$). Its likely detection
in graphene pores resolves conflicting experimental results, as well as

contained in its space-time solution, which motivates us to estimate the
adjoint gradient by leveraging the space-time solution. This article considers
a type of gray-box simulations where the flux function is partially unknown. A

is demonstrated to achieve good gradient estimation accuracies in several

actuators (such as arms and fingers), will in principle have the ability to
self-modify -- for example by changing its own source code. As we continue to
create more and more intelligent agents, chances increase that they will learn
about this ability. The question is: will they want to use it? For example,
highly intelligent systems may find ways to change their goals to something
more easily achievable, thereby `escaping' the control of their designers. In
an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued that goal preservation is a
fundamental drive of any intelligent system, since a goal is more likely to be
achieved if future versions of the agent strive towards the same goal. In this
paper, we formalise this argument in general reinforcement learning, and
explore situations where it fails. Our conclusion is that the self-modification
possibility is harmless if and only if the value function of the agent
anticipates the consequences of self-modifications and use the current utility
function when evaluating the future.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural approach. Unfortunately, RL does not
work well for generally intelligent agents, as RL agents are incentivised to
shortcut the reward sensor for maximum reward -- the so-called wireheading
problem. In this paper we suggest an alternative to RL called value
reinforcement learning (VRL). In VRL, agents use the reward signal to learn a
utility function. The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to wirehead
by placing a constraint on the agent's actions. The constraint is defined in
terms of the agent's belief distributions, and does not require an explicit

of every language is regular. Moreover, recent results show that downward
closures are computable for quite powerful system models.
  One advantage of abstracting a language by its downward closure is that then
equivalence and inclusion become decidable. In this work, we study the
complexity of these two problems. More precisely, we consider the following
decision problems: Given languages $K$ and $L$ from classes $\mathcal{C}$ and

  These problems are investigated for finite automata, one-counter automata,

Ackermann-hard and for higher-order pushdown automata of order~$k$, we prove

achieved by simultaneous estimation and variable selection methods such as L1
penalized corrected least squares. If the correct model is selected with high
probability then the L2 rate of convergence for the proposed method is indeed
the oracle rate of sqrt{s/n}. Here s, p are the number of non zero parameters
and the model dimension, respectively, and n is the sample size. Under very
general model selection criteria, the proposed method is computationally
simpler and statistically at least as efficient as the L1 penalized corrected
least squares method, performs model selection without the availability of the
bias correction matrix, and is able to provide estimates with only a small
sub-block of the bias correction covariance matrix of order s x s in comparison
to the p x p correction matrix required for computation of the L1 penalized
version. Furthermore we show that the model selection requirements are met by a
correlation screening type method and the L1 penalized corrected least squares

polynomials orthogonality condition. By decomposing the integration momenta
along parallel and orthogonal directions, the polynomial division algorithm is
drastically simplified. Moreover, the orthogonality conditions of Gegenbauer
polynomials can be suitably applied to integrate the decomposed integrand,
yielding the systematic annihilation of spurious terms. Consequently, multiloop

between the pointer states in the system orientational space. For a dielectric
ellipsoid immersed in a photon-gas environment (assuming no absorption), the
decay rate is found to be proportional to the seventh power of the temperature.
For an ellipsoidal object interacting with mass particles, the decay rate is
proportional to the 5/2 power of the temperature. Both are different from the

profile. Using a simple passive evolution model, we derive the expected
location of the ETGs on the red sequence (RS) in the color-magnitude diagram

with the position of the ETGs. A second approach involves a search for over

candidates. Four cluster candidates are found by both methods. The two methods
disagree in some cases, depending on the specific properties of each field. For

identify a population of bluer ETGs that lie on the expected location of the RS

detect the laterally induced optical forces. We engineered the cantilever shape
using a focused ion beam to enhance the torsional eigenmode resonance. The

be extended to simultaneously detect both lateral and longitudinal optical

micrometer was serendipitously detected in four preplanetary nebulae (PPNe;

designated as the ""21 micrometer"" feature, has been seen in 18 carbon-rich
PPNe. The nature of the carriers of this feature remains unknown although many
candidate materials have been proposed. The 21 micrometer sources also exhibit
an equally mysterious, unidentified emission feature peaking at 30 micrometer.
While the 21 micrometer feature is exclusively seen in PPNe, a short-lived
evolutionary stage between the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and
planetary nebula (PN) phases, the 30 micrometer feature is commonly observed in
all stages of stellar evolution from the AGB through PPN to PNe phases. We
derive the stellar mass loss rates (M_{loss}) of these 21 micrometer sources
from their dust infrared (IR) emission, using the ""2-DUST"" radiative transfer
code for axisymmetric dusty systems which allows one to distinguish the mass
loss rates of the AGB phase (\dot{M_{AGB}}) from that of the superwind
(\dot_{M_{SW}}) phase. We examine the correlation between \dot{M_{AGB}} or
\dot_{M_{SW}} and the fluxes emitted from the 21 and 30 micrometer features. We
find that both features tend to correlate with \dot{M_{AGB}}, suggesting that
their carriers are probably formed in the AGB phase. The nondetection of the 21
micrometer feature in AGB stars suggests that, unlike the 30 micrometer
feature, the excitation of the carriers of the 21 micrometer feature may
require ultraviolet photons which are available in PPNe but not in AGB stars.

  applications of the container method",,,,"math.CO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Addressing a question of Cameron and Erd\Ho s, we show that, for infinitely
many values of $n$, the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ that do not
contain a $k$-term arithmetic progression is at most $2^{O(r_k(n))}$, where
$r_k(n)$ is the maximum cardinality of a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ without
a $k$-term arithmetic progression. This bound is optimal up to a constant
factor in the exponent. For all values of $n$, we prove a weaker bound, which
is nevertheless sufficient to transfer the current best upper bound on $r_k(n)$
to the sparse random setting. To achieve these bounds, we establish a new
supersaturation result, which roughly states that sets of size $\Theta(r_k(n))$
contain superlinearly many $k$-term arithmetic progressions.
  For integers $r$ and $k$, Erd\Ho s asked whether there is a set of integers
$S$ with no $(k+1)$-term arithmetic progression, but such that any $r$-coloring
of $S$ yields a monochromatic $k$-term arithmetic progression. Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il
and R\""odl, and independently Spencer, answered this question affirmatively. We
show the following density version: for every $k\ge 3$ and $\delta>0$, there
exists a reasonably dense subset of primes $S$ with no $(k+1)$-term arithmetic
progression, yet every $U\subseteq S$ of size $|U|\ge\delta|S|$ contains a
$k$-term arithmetic progression.
  Our proof uses the hypergraph container method, which has proven to be a very
powerful tool in extremal combinatorics. The idea behind the container method
is to have a small certificate set to describe a large independent set. We give
two further applications in the appendix using this idea.

x S^3 x T^4 background with pure Ramond-Ramond flux and we find the all-loop
worldsheet S-matrix by exploiting the symmetries of the model in light-cone
gauge. As we naturally include the massless modes on the worldsheet, we derive
the full set of Bethe-Yang equations. In the massive sector we give also a
spin-chain description and we write down solutions compatible with crossing for
the scalar factors which are not constrained by simmetries. In the second part
of the thesis we consider the so-called ""eta-deformation"" of the superstring on
AdS_5 x S^5. We first discuss the effects of the deformation at the level of
the bosonic sigma-model, and we match the tree-level worldsheet scattering
processes to the expansion of the q-deformed S-matrix. To identify the missing
Ramond-Ramond fields we then compute the action quadratic in fermions, and we
provide an alternative derivation by looking at the kappa-symmetry variations.
The resulting background fields do not solve the equations of motion of type
IIB supergravity and we comment on this.

example where sub-mm observations with the SMA have revealed a clear
reflection-symmetric wiggle. The most likely explanation is that the HH 211 jet
source could be moving as part of a protobinary system. Here we test this
assumption by simulating HH 211 through 3D hydrodynamic jet propagation
simulations using the PLUTO code with a molecular chemistry and cooling module,
and initial conditions based on an analytical model derived from SMA
observations. Our results show the reflection-symmetric wiggle can be recreated
through the assumption of a jet source perturbed by binary motion at its base,
and that a regular sinusoidal velocity variation in the jet beam can be close
to matching the observed knot pattern. However, a more complex model with
either additional heating from the protostar, or a shorter period velocity
pulsation may be required to account for enhanced emission near the source, and
weaker knot emission downstream. Position velocity diagrams along the pulsed
jet beam show a complex structure with detectable signatures of knots and show
caution must be exercised when interpreting radial velocity profiles through
observations. Finally, we make predictions for future HH 211 observations with
ALMA.

far from the origin while our Higgs occupies the minimum near the origin of the

problem associated with it because its expectation value and mass are generated
by dimensional transmutation of the scalar quartic coupling. The location of
the second Higgs minimum is not a free parameter, but is rather a function of
the matter content of the theory. As a result, these theories are extremely
predictive. We develop this idea in the context of a solution to the strong CP

models that are consistent with the dark matter decay interpretation of the
recently detected line at 3.5 keV in the X-ray spectra of galaxies and
clusters. In warm dark matter models the primordial spectrum of density
perturbations has a cut-off on the scale of dwarf galaxies. Structure formation
therefore begins later than in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model and
very few objects form below the cut-off mass scale. To calculate the number of
ionising photons, we use the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,
GALFORM. We find that even the most extreme 7 keV sterile neutrino we consider
is able to reionise the Universe early enough to be compatible with the bounds
on the epoch of reionisation from Planck. This, perhaps surprising, result
arises from the rapid build-up of high redshift galaxies in the sterile
neutrino models which is also reflected in a faster evolution of their far-UV
luminosity function between $10>z>7$ than in CDM. The dominant sources of
ionising photons are systematically more massive in the sterile neutrino models
than in CDM. As a consistency check on the models, we calculate the present-day
luminosity function of satellites of Milky Way-like galaxies. When the
satellites recently discovered in the DES survey are taken into account, strong

ratios in the ~0.6-6 range, which corresponds to electron gas densities
$n_e$~1-300 cm$^{-3}$, with a median value of $n_e$=30 cm$^{-3}$. Variations in
the electron density within individual galaxies can be as a high as a factor of
~50, frequently with strong radial gradients. We find that $n_e$ increases as a
function of infrared color, dust-weighted mean starlight intensity, and star
formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$). As the intensity of the [NII]
transitions is related to the ionizing photon flux, we investigate their
reliability as tracers of the star formation rate (SFR). We derive relations

properties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems
in the COSMOS field at $z\lesssim$ 3. We show that at $z\lesssim$ 1, the median
star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on
environment, but they become independent of environment at $z\gtrsim$ 1.
However, we find that only for \textit{star-forming} galaxies, the median SFR
and sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and
stellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at
$z\lesssim$ 1, and on stellar mass out to $z\sim$ 3. We show that at
$z\lesssim$ 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that
the overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time.
Environmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At $z\lesssim$
1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses
(log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$ 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of
massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more
efficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency
($\epsilon_{mass}$) for more massive galaxies (log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$
10.2) rises with cosmic time until $z\sim$ 1 and flattens out since then.
However, for less massive galaxies, the rise in $\epsilon_{mass}$ continues to
the present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only
relevant at $z\lesssim$ 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the
dominant mechanism at $z\gtrsim$ 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.

radiative, accretion flow around a black hole, within the framework of general
relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics. As implemented in the code KORAL,
the gas consists of two sub-components -- ions and electrons -- which share the
same dynamics but experience independent, relativistically consistent,
thermodynamical evolution. The electrons and ions are heated independently
according to a standard prescription from the literature for
magnetohydrodynamical turbulent dissipation. Energy exchange between the
particle species via Coulomb collisions is included. In addition, electrons
gain and lose energy and momentum by absorbing and emitting synchrotron and
bremsstrahlung radiation, and through Compton scattering. All evolution
equations are handled within a fully covariant framework in the relativistic
fixed-metric spacetime of the black hole. Numerical results are presented for
five models of low luminosity black hole accretion. In the case of a model with
a mass accretion rate $\dot{M}\sim10^{-8} \dot M_{\rm Edd}$, we find that
radiation has a negligible effect on either the dynamics or the thermodynamics
of the accreting gas. In contrast, a model with a larger $\dot{M}\sim 4\times
10^{-4} \dot M_{\rm Edd}$ behaves very differently. The accreting gas is much
cooler and the flow is geometrically less thick, though it is not quite a thin
accretion disk.

for understanding the physics of the accretion disk and is gradually attributed
to the stochastic fluctuations over the accretion disk. Quasars generally
appear bluer when they brighten in the UV/optical, the nature of which remains
controversial. Recently \citeauthor{Sun2014} discovered that the color
variation of quasars is timescale dependent, in the way that faster variations
are even bluer than longer term ones. While this discovery can directly rule
out models that simply attribute the color variation to contamination from the
host galaxies, or to changes in the global accretion rates, it favors the
stochastic disk fluctuation model as fluctuations in the innermost hotter disk
could dominate the short-term variations. In this work, we show that a revised
inhomogeneous disk model, where the characteristic timescales of thermal
fluctuations in the disk are radius-dependent (i.e., $\tau \sim r$; based on
the one originally proposed by \citeauthor{DexterAgol2011}), can well reproduce
a timescale dependent color variation pattern, similar to the observed one and
unaffected by the un-even sampling and photometric error. This demonstrates
that one may statistically use variation emission at different timescales to
spatially resolve the accretion disk in quasars, thus opens a new window to
probe and test the accretion disk physics in the era of time domain astronomy.
Caveats of the current model, which ought to be addressed in future
simulations, are discussed.

historical galactic SN IIb. We revisit the results of Rest et al. (2011a), who
used light echoes to observe Cas A from multiple lines of sight and hence
determine its asphericity, as seen in the velocity of three spectral lines (He
I $\lambda$5876, H$\alpha$ and the Ca II NIR triplet). We confirm and improve
on this measurement by reproducing the effect of the light echoes in the
spectra of several extragalactic SNe IIb found in the literature as well as
mean SN IIb spectra recently created by Liu et al. (2016), and comparing these
to the observed light echo spectra of Cas A, including their associated
uncertainties. In order to quantify the accuracy of this comparison we smooth
the light echo spectra of Cas A using Gaussian processes and use a Monte Carlo
method to measure the absorption velocities of these three features in the
spectra. We then test the hypothesis that the diversity of ejecta velocities
seen in SNe IIb can be explained by asphericity. We do this by comparing the
range of velocities seen in the different light echoes, and hence different
lines of sight, of Cas A to that seen in the population of SNe IIb. We conclude
that these two ranges are of the same order and thus asphericity could be
enough to explain the diversity in the expansion velocity alone.

effects of orbital anisotropy and tidally under-filling clusters. While a
strong degeneracy exists between the two parameters, we use kinematic studies
to help constrain the distance $R_\beta$ beyond which cluster orbits become
anisotropic, as well as the distance $R_{f\alpha}$ beyond which clusters are
tidally under-filling. For M87 we find $R_\beta > 27$ kpc and $20 < R_{f\alpha}
< 40$ kpc and for NGC 1399 $R_\beta > 13$ kpc and $10 < R_{f\alpha} < 30$ kpc.
The connection of $R_{f\alpha}$ with each galaxy's mass profile indicates the
relationship between size and $R_{gc}$ may be imposed at formation, with only
inner clusters being tidally affected. The best fitted models suggest the
dynamical histories of brightest cluster galaxies yield similar present-day
distributions of cluster properties. For NGC 5128, the central giant in a small
galaxy group, we find $R_\beta > 5$ kpc and $R_{f\alpha} > 30$ kpc. While we
cannot rule out a dependence on $R_{gc}$, NGC 5128 is well fitted by a tidally
filling cluster population with an isotropic distribution of orbits, suggesting
it may have formed via an initial fast accretion phase. Perturbations from the
surrounding environment may also affect a galaxy's orbital anisotropy profile,
as outer clusters in M87 and NGC 1399 have primarily radial orbits while outer
NGC 5128 clusters remain isotropic.

characteristics and other physical source properties (such as the black hole

perform a new, fully analytical, power spectral density (PSD) model analysis
method, which will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper, that takes
into consideration the spectral distortions, caused by red-noise leak. We find
that the PSD in the $0.5-10$ keV energy range, can be represented by a bending
power-law with a bend around $6.7\times10^{-5}$ Hz, having a slope of $0.51$
and $1.99$ below and above the bend, respectively. Adding our bend time-scale
estimate, to an already published ensemble of estimates from several AGN,
supports the idea that the bend time-scale depends linearly only on the black
hole mass and not on the bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find that as the
energy range increases, the PSD normalization increases and there is a hint
that simultaneously the high frequency slope becomes steeper. Finally, the
X-ray time-lag spectrum of NGC 7314 shows some very weak signatures of
relativistic reflection, and the energy resolved time-lag spectrum, for
frequencies around $3\times10^{-4}$ Hz, shows no signatures of X-ray
reverberation. We show that the previous claim about ks time-delays in this
source, is simply an artefact induced by the minuscule number of points
entering during the time-lag estimation in the low frequency part of the

the dense core of a $5-7\times10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$ cluster. The most plausible
candidates to power the nebula are two Chandra-detected AGN host cluster
members, while cooling from the X-ray phase and cosmological cold flows are
disfavored primarily because of the high Ly$\alpha$ to X-ray luminosity ratio
($L_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}/L_{\mathrm{X}} \approx0.3$, $\gtrsim10-1000\times$
higher than in local cool-core clusters) and by current modeling. Given the
physical conditions of the Ly$\alpha$-emitting gas and the possible interplay
with the X-ray phase, we argue that the Ly$\alpha$ nebula would be short-lived
($\lesssim10$ Myr) if not continuously replenished with cold gas at a rate of
$\gtrsim1000$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We investigate the possibility that
cluster galaxies supply the required gas through outflows and we show that
their total mass outflow rate matches the replenishment necessary to sustain
the nebula. This scenario directly implies the extraction of energy from
galaxies and its deposition in the surrounding intracluster medium, as required
to explain the thermodynamic properties of local clusters. We estimate an
energy injection of the order of $\thickapprox2$ keV per particle in the
intracluster medium over a $2$ Gyr interval. In our baseline calculation AGN
provide up to $85$% of the injected energy and 2/3 of the mass, while the rest

reduction strategy in order to assure the removal of cosmic rays, persistence
signal, and other data artifacts, we have produced high-quality science-ready
images of the targets and their local environments. We observe targets with
regions of UV emission suggestive of active star formation. In addition,
several targets exhibit highly distorted host galaxy morphologies in the rest
frame visible images. Photometric analyses reveals that brighter QSOs tend to
be generally redder than their dimmer counterparts. Using emission line fluxes
from the literature, we estimate that emission line contamination is relatively
small in the rest frame UV images for the QSOs. Using archival VLA data, we
have also created radio map overlays for each of our targets, allowing for
analysis of the optical and radio axes alignment.

of periodic kicking potentials for which the Hall effect from $\mathbf{B}$ and
$\mathbf{E}$ significantly suppresses the weak chaos, replacing it by
\emph{""superweak""} chaos (SWC). This means that the system behaves as if the
kicking strength were $\kappa ^2$ rather than $\kappa$. For $E=0$, SWC is known
to be a classical fingerprint of quantum antiresonance but it occurs under much
less generic conditions, in particular only for very special kicking
potentials. Manifestations of SWC are a decrease in the instability of periodic
orbits and a narrowing of the chaotic layers, relative to the ordinary
weak-chaos case. Also, for global SWC, taking place on an infinite ""stochastic
web"" in phase space, the chaotic diffusion on the web is much slower than the
weak-chaos one. Thus, the Hall effect can be relatively stabilizing for small
$\kappa$. In some special cases, the effect is shown to cause ballistic motion
for almost all parameter values. The generic global SWC on stochastic webs in
the KHS appears to be the two-dimensional closest analog to the Arnol'd web in
higher dimensional systems.

Gluon radiation violates the scaling feature. Transverse momentum distribution

this article, by the use of data resulted from the annihilation process of
electron positron in AMY detector at 60 GeV center of mass energy, first,
charged particles multiplicity distribution will be obtained and it will be
fitted with the KNO scaling. Furthermore, momentum spectra of charged particles
and momentum distribution respect to the jet axis will be obtained. Then, the
results will be compared regarding the different models of QCD; as well, the
distribution of fragmentation functions and scaling violations will be studied.
It is being expected that the scaling violations of the fragmentation functions
of gluon jet are stronger to the quark one. One of the reasons for such case is
that splitting function of jet is larger than splitting function of gluon.

the exploitation of space-based imaging surveys. In this article, we
investigate the classification of stars into spectral types using only the
shape of their diffraction pattern in a single broad-band image. We propose a
supervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal
component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial
neural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed
with image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid
VIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,
assuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the
possibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine
learning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in
which the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars
from a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.
We use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral
type and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral
subclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a
high success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a
spectral class. Although more detailed simulations would be needed to assess
the performance of the algorithm on a specific survey, this shows that stellar
classification from single-band images is well possible.

\mcst) problem: find a min-cost spanning tree in a graph subject to degree
constraints on a nested family of node sets. We devise the {\em first} polytime
algorithm that finds a spanning tree that (i) violates the degree constraints
by at most a constant factor {\em and} (ii) whose cost is within a constant
factor of the optimum. Previously, only an algorithm for {\em unweighted} \cst
was known \cite{olver}, which satisfied (i) but did not yield any cost bounds.
This also yields the first result that obtains an $O(1)$-factor for {\em both}
the cost approximation and violation of degree constraints for any
spanning-tree problem with general degree bounds on node sets, where an edge
participates in a super-constant number of degree constraints.
  A notable feature of our algorithm is that we {\em reduce} \mcst to
unweighted \cst (and then utilize \cite{olver}) via a novel application of {\em
Lagrangian duality} to simplify the {\em cost structure} of the underlying
problem and obtain a decomposition into certain uniform-cost subproblems.
  We show that this Lagrangian-relaxation based idea is in fact applicable more
generally and, for any cost-minimization problem with packing side-constraints,
yields a reduction from the weighted to the unweighted problem. We believe that
this reduction is of independent interest. As another application of our
technique, we consider the {\em $k$-budgeted matroid basis} problem, where we
build upon a recent rounding algorithm of \cite{BansalN16} to obtain an
improved $n^{O(k^{1.5}/\epsilon)}$-time algorithm that returns a solution that
satisfies (any) one of the budget constraints exactly and incurs a
$(1+\epsilon)$-violation of the other budget constraints.

degenerate atoms using the most magnetic fermionic element, dysprosium.
Spin-orbit-coupling arises from a synthetic gauge field created by the
adiabatic following of degenerate dressed states comprised of optically coupled
components of an atomic spin. Because of dysprosium's large electronic orbital
angular momentum and large magnetic moment, the lifetime of the gas is limited
not by spontaneous emission from the light-matter coupling, as for gases of
alkali-metal atoms, but by dipolar relaxation of the spin. This relaxation is
suppressed at large magnetic fields due to Fermi statistics. We observe
lifetimes up to 400 ms, which exceeds that of spin-orbit-coupled fermionic
alkali atoms by a factor of 10-100, and is close to the value obtained from a
theoretical model. Elastic dipolar interactions are also observed to influence
the Rabi evolution of the spin, revealing an interacting fermionic system. The
long lifetime of this weakly interacting spin-orbit-coupled degenerate Fermi
gas will facilitate the study of quantum many-body phenomena manifest at longer
timescales, with exciting implications for the exploration of exotic
topological quantum liquids.

Universe to be filled with dust-like matter in the form of discretely

energy, and radiation as matter sources. We investigate such a Universe in the
mechanical approach. This means that the peculiar velocities of the
inhomogeneities (in the form of galaxies) as well as the fluctuations of the
other perfect fluids are non-relativistic. Such fluids are designated as
coupled because they are concentrated around the inhomogeneities. In the
present paper, we investigate the conditions under which the $K$-essence scalar
field with the most general form for its action can become coupled. We
investigate at the background level three particular examples of the
$K$-essence models: (i) the pure kinetic $K$-essence field, (ii) a $K$-essence
with a constant speed of sound and (iii) the $K$-essence model with the
Lagrangian $bX+cX^2-V(\phi)$. We demonstrate that if the $K$-essence is
coupled, all these $K$-essence models take the form of multicomponent perfect
fluids where one of the component is the cosmological constant. Therefore, they
can provide the late-time cosmic acceleration and be simultaneously compatible

multi-dimensional summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference operators. More
precisely, the focus is on diagonal-norm SBP operators that are not based on
tensor products and are applicable to unstructured grids composed of arbitrary
elements. We show how penalty terms --- simultaneous approximation terms (SATs)
--- can be adapted to discretizations based on multi-dimensional SBP operators
to enforce boundary and interface conditions. A general SAT framework is
presented that leads to conservative and stable discretizations of the
variable-coefficient advection equation. This framework includes the case where
there are no nodes on the boundary of the SBP element at which to apply
penalties directly. This is an important generalization, because elements
analogous to Legendre-Gauss collocation, \ie without boundary nodes, typically
have higher accuracy for the same number of degrees of freedom. Symmetric and
upwind examples of the general SAT framework are created using a decomposition
of the symmetric part of an SBP operator; these particular SATs enable the
pointwise imposition of boundary and inter-element conditions. We illustrate
the proposed SATs using triangular-element SBP operators with and without nodes
that lie on the boundary. The accuracy, conservation, and stability properties
of the resulting SBP-SAT discretizations are verified using linear advection
problems with spatially varying divergence-free velocity fields.

the framework of the Japanese collaboration for Gravitational wave
ElectroMagnetic follow-up (J-GEM), which is an observing group utilizing
optical and radio telescopes in Japan, as well as those in New Zealand, China,
South Africa, Chile, and Hawaii. We carried out a wide-field imaging survey
with Kiso Wide Field Camera (KWFC) on the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope in
Japan and a galaxy-targeted survey with Tripole5 on the B&C 61-cm telescope in
New Zealand. Approximately 24 deg2 regions in total were surveyed in i-band
with KWFC and 18 nearby galaxies were observed with Tripole5 in g-, r-, and
i-bands 4-12 days after the gravitational wave detection. Median 5-sigma depths
are i~18.9 mag for the KWFC data and g~18.9 mag, r~18.7 mag, and i~18.3 mag for
the Tripole5 data. Probability for a counterpart to be in the observed area is
1.2% in the initial skymap and 0.1% in the final skymap. We do not find any
transient source associated to an external galaxy with spatial offset from its
center, which is consistent with the local supernova rate. We summarize future
prospects and ongoing efforts to pin down electromagnetic counterparts of
binary black hole mergers as well as neutron star mergers.

using sparse coding techniques. The proposed approach includes two main
contributions: i) A new method to handle intra-class variations by decomposing
each video into a reduced set of representative atomic action acts or
key-sequences, and ii) A new video descriptor, ITRA: Inter-Temporal Relational
Act Descriptor, that exploits the power of comparative reasoning to capture
relative similarity relations among key-sequences. In terms of the method to
obtain key-sequences, we introduce a loss function that, for each video, leads
to the identification of a sparse set of representative key-frames capturing
both, relevant particularities arising in the input video, as well as relevant
generalities arising in the complete class collection. In terms of the method
to obtain the ITRA descriptor, we introduce a novel scheme to quantify relative
intra and inter-class similarities among local temporal patterns arising in the

discriminate among action categories. As a result, the proposed approach
reaches remarkable action recognition performance on several popular benchmark

discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of linear partial differential

discretizations, and hence inheriting advances from both sides. In particular,
the method can be viewed as a Gauss-Seidel approach that requires only
independent element-by-element and face-by-face local solves in each iteration.
As such, it is well-suited for current and future computing systems with
massive concurrencies. Unlike conventional Gauss-Seidel schemes which are
purely algebraic, the convergence of iHDG, thanks to the built-in HDG numerical
flux, does not depend on the ordering of unknowns. We rigorously show the
convergence of the proposed method for the transport equation, the linearized
shallow water equation and the convection-diffusion equation. For the transport
equation, the method is convergent regardless of mesh size $h$ and solution
order $p$, and furthermore the convergence rate is independent of the solution
order. For the linearized shallow water and the convection-diffusion equations
we show that the convergence is conditional on both $h$ and $p$. Extensive
steady and time-dependent numerical results for the 2D and 3D transport
equations, the linearized shallow water equation, and the convection-diffusion

velocities of the targets. Standard approaches to MIMO radar based on digital
matched filtering or compressed sensing only resolve the angle-delay-Doppler

recovered perfectly by solving a convex optimization problem. This result holds
provided that the angle-delay-Doppler triplets are separated either by $10/(N_T

a precise prescription for the Wick rotation from the Euclidean theory to the
Lorentzian one, eliminating the extra degrees of freedom. This requires not
only projecting out mirror fermions, as has been done so far, and which leads
to the correct Pfaffian, but also the elimination of the remaining extra
degrees of freedom. The remaining doubling has to be removed in order to
recover the correct Fock space of the physical (Lorentzian) theory. In order to
get a Spin(1,3) invariant Lorentzian theory from a Spin(4) invariant Euclidean
theory such an elimination must be performed after the Wick rotation.
Differences between the Euclidean and Lorentzian case are described in detail,

while the interaction with the surrounding environment is modeled through an
effective operator. This effective operator represents the environment by
atom-centered multipoles and polarizabilities derived from quantum mechanical
calculations on (fragments of) the environment. Thereby, the polarization of
the environment is explicitly accounted for. Here, we present the coupling of
the PE approach with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). This
PE-DMRG method is particularly suitable for embedded subsystems that feature a
dense manifold of frontier orbitals which requires large active spaces.
Recovering such static electron-correlation effects in multiconfigurational

  A Loosely Coherent detection pipeline was applied to follow up weak outliers
in both Gaussian (95% recovery rate) and non-Gaussian (75% recovery rate)
bands. No gravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were
placed on their strength. Our smallest upper limit on worst-case (linearly

  Information","submitted to a journal",,,,"cs.IT cs.CV math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of compressed sensing (CS), this paper considers the problem
of reconstructing sparse signals with the aid of other given correlated sources
as multiple side information. To address this problem, we theoretically study a
generic \textcolor{black}{weighted $n$-$\ell_{1}$ minimization} framework and
propose a reconstruction algorithm that leverages multiple side information
signals (RAMSI). The proposed RAMSI algorithm computes adaptively optimal
weights among the side information signals at every reconstruction iteration.
In addition, we establish theoretical bounds on the number of measurements that
are required to successfully reconstruct the sparse source by using
\textcolor{black}{weighted $n$-$\ell_{1}$ minimization}. The analysis of the
established bounds reveal that \textcolor{black}{weighted $n$-$\ell_{1}$
minimization} can achieve sharper bounds and significant performance
improvements compared to classical CS. We evaluate experimentally the proposed
RAMSI algorithm and the established bounds using synthetic sparse signals as
well as correlated feature histograms, extracted from a multiview image
database for object recognition. The obtained results show clearly that the
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms---\textcolor{black}{including classical CS, $\ell_1\text{-}\ell_1$

  Strategy","12 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.MM cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The explosive demand of on-line video from smart mobile devices poses
unprecedented challenges to delivering high quality of experience (QoE) over
wireless networks. Streaming high-definition video with low delay is difficult
mainly due to (i) the stochastic nature of wireless channels and (ii) the
fluctuating videos bit rate. To address this, we propose a novel delay-aware
fountain coding (DAF) technique that integrates channel coding and video
coding. In this paper, we reveal that the fluctuation of video bit rate can
also be exploited to further improve fountain codes for wireless video
streaming. Specifically, we develop two coding techniques: the time-based
sliding window and the optimal window-wise sampling strategy. By adaptively
selecting the window length and optimally adjusting the sampling pattern
according to the ongoing video bit rate, the proposed schemes deliver
significantly higher video quality than existing schemes, with low delay and
constant data rate. To validate our design, we implement the protocols of DAF,
DAF-L (a low-complexity version) and the existing delay-aware video streaming
schemes by streaming H.264/AVC standard videos over an 802.11b network on CORE
emulation platform. The results show that the decoding ratio of our scheme is
15% to 100% higher than the state of the art techniques.

enhanced by Fabry-Perot resonator design of CMOS photonic-compatible

different observed parameters and the capability of deriving accurate intrinsic
stellar parameters from them through the analysis of the largest spectroscopic
sample of CSGs to date from SMC and LMC. We explore possible correlations
between different observational parameters, also making use of near- and
mid-infrared colours and literature on photometric variability. Direct
comparison between the behaviour of atomic lines (Fe I, Ti I, and Ca II) in the
observed spectra and synthetic atmospheric models provides compelling evidence
that effective temperature is the prime underlying variable driving the SpT
sequence in CSGs. However, there is a clear correlation between SpT and
luminosity, with later ones tending to correspond to more luminous stars with
heavier mass loss. The population of CSGs in the SMC is characterised by a
higher degree of spectral variability, early spectral types (centred on type
K1) and low mass-loss rates (at least as measured by dust-sensitive
mid-infrared colours). The population in the LMC displays less spectroscopic
variability and later spectral types. The distribution of spectral types is not
single-peaked. Instead, the brightest CSGs have a significantly different
distribution from less luminous objects, presenting mostly M subtypes (centred
on M2), and increasing mass-loss rates for later types. In conclusion, the
observed properties of CSGs in the SMC and the LMC cannot be described
correctly by standard evolutionary models. The very strong correlation between
spectral type and bolometric luminosity, supported by all data from the Milky
Way, cannot be reproduced at all by current evolutionary tracks.

largely uncharted territory. We focus here on the properties of forward
reachable sets (FRS) as a function of the underlying degree distribution and
edge duration. FRS are defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from an
initial seed via a path of temporally ordered edges; a natural extension of
connected component measures to dynamic networks. Working in a stochastic
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the
exponential growth rate of the FRS for temporal networks with both edge and
node dynamics. For networks with node dynamics, we calculate thresholds for the
growth of the FRS. The effects of finite population size are explored via
simulation and approximation. We examine how these properties vary by edge
duration and different cross-sectional degree distributions that characterize a
range of scientifically interesting normative outcomes (Poisson and Bernoulli).
The size of the forward reachable set gives an upper bound for the epidemic
size in disease transmission network models, relating this work to epidemic
modeling (Ferguson 2000, Eames 2004).

five-year time span. The analysis showed that the possible Blazhko period of 75
days published by the General Catalogue of Variable Stars is not correct. We
identified two Blazhko periods of 43.6 and 45.5 days. This finding is based on
measurement of 124 light maxima. A spectral analysis of the complete light
curve confirmed these two periods. Besides the Blazhko amplitude and phase
modulations, another long term periodic phase variation has been identified.
This long term periodic variation affects the times of maximum light only and
can be attributed to a light-travel time effect due to orbital motion of a
binary system. The orbital parameters have been estimated by a nonlinear
least-square fit applied to the set of (O-C) values. The Levenberg-Marquart
algorithm has been used to perform the nonlinear least-square fit. The
tentative orbital parameters include an orbital period of 1676 days, a minimal
semi-major axis of 1.55 AU and a small eccentricity of 0.22. The orbital
parameter estimation also used 33 (O-C) values obtained from the SWASP survey
database. Spectroscopic radial velocity measurements are needed to confirm this
binarity. If confirmed, TU Com would be the first Blazhko RR Lyrae star
detected in a binary system.

  Operating over Generalized Fading Channels","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Device-to-device (D2D) communications are now considered as an integral part
of future 5G networks which will enable direct communication between user
equipment (UE) without unnecessary routing via the network infrastructure. This
architecture will result in higher throughputs than conventional cellular
networks, but with the increased potential for co-channel interference induced
by randomly located cellular and D2D UEs. The physical channels which
constitute D2D communications can be expected to be complex in nature,
experiencing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions across
closely located D2D pairs. As well as this, given the diverse range of
operating environments, they may also be subject to clustering of the scattered
multipath contribution, i.e., propagation characteristics which are quite
dissimilar to conventional Rayeligh fading environments. To address these
challenges, we consider two recently proposed generalized fading models, namely
$\kappa-\mu$ and $\eta-\mu$, to characterize the fading behavior in D2D
communications. Together, these models encompass many of the most widely
encountered and utilized fading models in the literature such as Rayleigh, Rice
(Nakagami-$n$), Nakagami-$m$, Hoyt (Nakagami-$q$) and One-Sided Gaussian. Using
stochastic geometry we evaluate the rate and bit error probability of D2D
networks under generalized fading conditions. Based on the analytical results,
we present new insights into the trade-offs between the reliability, rate, and
mode selection under realistic operating conditions. Our results suggest that
D2D mode achieves higher rates over cellular link at the expense of a higher
bit error probability. Through numerical evaluations, we also investigate the
performance gains of D2D networks and demonstrate their superiority over
traditional cellular networks.

satisfies the equation $$ \phi^{\bar ji}\phi_{i\bar j}=2\Delta_0 S_0 +
R_0^{\bar ji}R_{0i\bar j} - S_0^2, $$ where $\Delta_0$ is the Laplace operator,

microstructures generated from solid state phase transformations.
Interpretations, predictions and simulations of the faceted morphologies remain
a challenge, especially for systems in which irrational orientation
relationships (ORs) between two phases and irrational interface orientations
(IOs) are preferred. In terms of structural singularities, this work suggests
an integrated framework, which possibly encompasses all candidates of faceted
interfaces. The structural singularities are identified in a matching pattern,
a dislocation structure and/or a ledge structure. The resultant singular
interfaces are discrete IOs, described with low index g's (rational
orientations) and/or Delta-g's (either rational or irrational orientations).
Elimination of defects exerts restrictions on the OR and the lattice
parameters. Various models are grouped according to their determined results
regarding the OR and IO, and the links between the models are clarified in the
integrated framework. An irrational IO is usually due to elimination of
dislocations in one direction, i.e., an O-line interface. Analytical methods
using both 3D and 2D models for quantitative determinations of O-line
interfaces are reviewed, and a detailed example showing the calculation for an
irrational interface is given. The association between structural singularities
and local energy minima is verified by atomistic calculations of interfacial
energies in fcc/bcc alloys where it is found that the calculated equilibrium
cross-sections are in a good agreement with observations from selected alloys.

initialization is achieved by a quantum-mechanical bifurcation based on quantum
adiabatic evolution, which yields a Schr\""odinger cat state. All the elementary
quantum gates are also achieved by quantum adiabatic evolution, in which
dynamical phases accompanying the adiabatic evolutions are controlled by the

spectropolarimetric observations with CFHT/ESPaDOnS to measure the circular
polarization in the line profile of the star during its rotation cycle, as well
as spectroscopic proxies of the chromospheric activity. The average field has
an amplitude of 16 G. The magnetic topology is characterized by a poloidal and
a toroidal component, encompassing 60% and 40% of the magnetic energy,
respectively. Differential rotation is detected with an estimated rate of
0.105+-0.039 rad/d. Activity tracers vary with the rotation cycle of the star;
there is no hint that a residual activity level is related to the planetary

configurational heat capacity, entropy, and the effect of a strong electric
field on the glass transition. The model is based on Pad{\'e}-truncated
perturbation expansions of the liquid state theory. Depending on parameters, it
accommodates an ideal glass transition of vanishing configurational entropy and
its avoidance, with a square-root divergent enumeration function at the point
of its termination. A composite density-temperature parameter $\rho^\gamma/T$,
often used to represent combined pressure and temperature data, follows from
the model. The theory is in good agreement with experimental data for excess
(over the crystal state) thermodynamics of molecular glass formers. We suggest
that the Kauzmann entropy crisis might be a signature of vanishing
configurational entropy of a subset of degrees of freedom, multipolar rotations
in our model. This scenario has observable consequences: (i) a dynamical
cross-over of the relaxation time and (ii) the fragility index defined by the
ratio of the excess heat capacity and excess entropy at the glass transition.
The Kauzmann temperature of vanishing configurational entropy, and the
corresponding glass transition temperature, shift upward when the electric
field is applied. The temperature shift scales quadratically with the field
strength.

three-stage training. A deep Convolutional Neural Network (dCNN) is first
trained on an independent dataset labeled with attributes. Then it is
fine-tuned on another dataset only labeled with person IDs using our defined

target dataset, which is combined with the independent dataset for the final
round of fine-tuning. The predicted attributes, namely \emph{deep attributes}
exhibit superior generalization ability across different datasets. By directly
using the deep attributes with simple Cosine distance, we have obtained
surprisingly good accuracy on four person ReID datasets. Experiments also show
that a simple metric learning modular further boosts our method, making it

plasmonic scattering dominated by a bulk dipolar mode, a complex
surface-induced multipolar source at the doubled frequency sets a fundamental
limit to control the SH radiation from metallic nanostructures. In this work,
we harness plasmonic hybridization mechanism together with a special selection
rule governing the SH radiation to achieve the high-intensity and
tunable-direction emission by a metallic particle-in-cavity nanoantenna
(PIC-NA). The nanoantenna is modelled with a first-principle, self-consistent
boundary element method, which considers the depletion of pump waves. The giant
SH enhancement arises from a hybridized gap plasmon resonance between the small
particle and the large cavity that functions as a concentrator and reflector.
Centrosymmetry breaking of the PIC-NA not only modifies the gap plasmon mode
boosting the SH signal, but also redirects the SH wave with a unidirectional
emission. The PIC-NA has a significantly larger SH conversion efficiency
compared to existing literature. The main beam of the radiation pattern can be
steered over a wide angle by tuning the particle's position.

fainter than the outbursting star (delta(K') = 3.34 +/- 0.10 mag). Given the

therefore it resembles a typical T Tauri binary system. Our observations only
achieve contrast limits of delta(K') ~ 4 mag, and hence we are only sensitive

It remains plausible that FUor outbursts could be tied to the presence of a

low-dimensional quantum matter. By contrast, relatively little work exists on
the identification, let alone classification, of QSL phases for spin-1 systems
in dimensions higher than one. Employing the powerful ideas of tensor network
theory and its classification, we develop general methods for writing QSL wave
functions of spin-1 respecting all the lattice symmetries, spin rotation, and
time reversal with trivial gauge structure on the square lattice. We find $2^5$
distinct classes characterized by five binary quantum numbers. Several explicit
constructions of such wave functions are given for bond dimensions $D$ ranging
from two to four, along with thorough numerical analyses to identify their
physical characters. Both gapless and gapped states are found. The topological
entanglement entropy of the gapped states are close to zero, indicative of
topologically trivial states. In $D=4$, several different tensors can be
linearly combined to produce a family of states within the same symmetry class.
A rich ""phase diagram"" can be worked out among the phases of these tensors, as
well as the phase transitions among them. Among the states we identified in
this putative phase diagram is the plaquette-ordered phase, gapped resonating
valence bond phase, and a critical phase. A continuous transition separates the
plaquette-ordered phase from the resonating valence bond phase.

decides the nucleation density and morphology of islands during thin film
growth. During template-assisted surface growth in particular, low surface
mobilities can prevent monomers from reaching target sites and this results in
a partial to complete loss of nucleation control. While in atomic systems a
broad range of surface mobilities can be readily accessed, for colloids, owing
to their large size, this window is substantially narrow and therefore imposes
severe restrictions in extending template-assisted growth techniques to steer
their self-assembly. Here, we circumvented this fundamental limitation by
designing templates with spatially varying feature sizes, in this case moire
patterns, which in the presence of short-range depletion attraction presented
surface energy gradients for the diffusing colloids. The templates serve a dual
purpose, first, directing the particles to target sites by enhancing their
surface mean free paths and second, dictating the size and symmetry of the
growing crystallites. Using optical microscopy, we directly followed the
nucleation and growth kinetics of colloidal islands on these surfaces at the
single-particle level. We demonstrate nucleation control, with high fidelity,
in a regime that has remained unaccessed in theoretical, numerical and
experimental studies on atoms and molecules as well. Our findings pave the way
for fabricating non-trivial surface architectures composed of complex colloids

from the fact that, compared to 2D space, more geographic diversity can be
exploited via 3D space, which means that generating more simultaneous
percolation highways is possible. In addition, cut-set upper bounds on the

is possible to obtain systems of linear algebraic equations with better

accuracy of calculations is attained at the expense of employing finite
difference approximations of higher accuracy order that are based on the
dispersion-relationship-preserving method and the Richardson extrapolation in
the downward continuation direction. The numerical experiments have verified
that as compared to the spectral difference method based on Fourier transform,
the new algorithm allows one to calculate wave fields with a higher degree of
accuracy and a lower level of numerical noise and artifacts including those for
non-smooth velocity models. In the context of solving the geophysical problem
the post-stack migration for velocity models of the types Syncline and
Sigsbee2A has been carried out. It is shown that the images obtained contain

estimator is based on an extension of a popular moment-based lower bound (Chao,

involving an inflaton interacting with the Einstein-Maxwell system in two extra
dimensions. The models are Goldilocks-like in that they are just complicated
enough to include a mechanism to stabilize the extra-dimensional size, yet
simple enough to solve the full 6D field equations using basic tools. The
solutions are not limited to the effective 4D regime with H << m_KK (the latter
referring to the mass splitting of the Kaluza-Klein excitations) because the
full 6D Einstein equations are solved. This allows an exploration of
inflationary physics in a controlled regime away from the usual 4D lamp-post.
The inclusion of modulus stabilization is important as experience with string
models teaches that this is usually what makes models fail: stabilization
energies dominate the shallow potentials required by slow roll and open up
directions to evolve that are steeper than those of the putative inflationary
direction. We explore three representative inflationary scenarios within this
simple setup. In one the radion is trapped in an inflaton-dependent local
minimum whose non-zero energy drives inflation. Inflation ends as this energy
relaxes to zero when the inflaton finds its minimum. The others involve
power-law solutions during inflation. One is an attractor whose features are
relatively insensitive to initial conditions but whose slow-roll parameters
cannot be arbitrarily small; the other is not an attractor but can roll much
more slowly, until eventually decaying to the attractor. These solutions can
satisfy H > m_KK, but when they do standard 4D fluctuation calculations need
not apply. When in a 4D regime the solutions predict eta ~ 0 hence r ~ 0.11
when n_s ~ 0.96 and so are ruled out if tensor modes remain unseen. Analysis of

the mass of its host cluster dark matter (DM) halo, initial positions and

exponentially with the sample size. To assess their performance, we establish
the oracle inequalities, as in Bickel, Ritov and Tsybakov (2009), of the global

polynomially growing dimensionality, the $L_1$-regularization method of Lasso
and concave methods are asymptotically equivalent, having the same convergence
rates in the oracle inequalities. For exponentially growing dimensionality,
concave methods are asymptotically equivalent but have faster convergence rates
than the Lasso. We also establish a stronger property of the oracle risk

length at most $k$, $x$ occurs equally many times as a factor in both $u$ and
$v$. The notion of $k$-abelian equivalence is an intermediate notion between
the abelian equivalence and the equality of words. In this paper, we study the
equivalence classes induced by the $k$-abelian equivalence, mainly focusing on
the cardinalities of the classes. In particular, we are interested in the
number of singleton $k$-abelian classes, i.e., classes containing only one
element. We find a connection between the singleton classes and cycle
decompositions of the de Bruijn graph. We show that the number of classes of
words of length $n$ containing one single element is of order $\mathcal
O(n^{N_m(k-1)-1})$, where $N_m(l) = \tfrac{1}{l}\sum_{d\mid l}
\varphi(d)m^{l/d}$ is the number of necklaces of length $l$ over an $m$-ary
alphabet. We conjecture that the upper bound is sharp. We also remark that, for
$k$ even and $m = 2$, the lower bound $\Omega(n^{N_m(k-1)-1})$ follows from an
old conjecture on the existence of Gray codes for necklaces of odd length. We
verify this conjecture for necklaces of length up to 15.

fundamental physical process in magnetized plasma systems all over the
universe1,2. Its process is difficult to be directly observed. Coronal
structures, such as coronal loops and filament spines, often sketch the
magnetic field geometry and its changes in the solar corona3. Here we show a
highly suggestive observation of magnetic reconnection between an erupting
solar filament and its nearby coronal loops, resulting in changes in connection
of the filament. X-type structures form when the erupting filament encounters
the loops. The filament becomes straight, and bright current sheets form at the
interfaces with the loops. Many plasmoids appear in these current sheets and
propagate bi-directionally. The filament disconnects from the current sheets,
which gradually disperse and disappear, reconnects to the loops, and becomes
redirected to the loop footpoints. This evolution of the filament and the loops
suggests successive magnetic reconnection predicted by theories1 but rarely
detected with such clarity in observations. Our results on the formation,
evolution, and disappearance of current sheets, confirm three-dimensional
magnetic reconnection theory and have implications for the evolution of
dissipation regions and the release of magnetic energy for reconnection in many
magnetized plasma systems.

penalized likelihood methods for high-dimensional data analysis. We examine
this problem in the setting of penalized likelihood methods for generalized
linear models, where the dimensionality of covariates p is allowed to increase
exponentially with the sample size n. We propose to select the tuning parameter
by optimizing the generalized information criterion (GIC) with an appropriate
model complexity penalty. To ensure that we consistently identify the true
model, a range for the model complexity penalty is identified in GIC. We find
that this model complexity penalty should diverge at the rate of some power of
$\log p$ depending on the tail probability behavior of the response variables.
This reveals that using the AIC or BIC to select the tuning parameter may not
be adequate for consistently identifying the true model. Based on our
theoretical study, we propose a uniform choice of the model complexity penalty
and show that the proposed approach consistently identifies the true model
among candidate models with asymptotic probability one. We justify the
performance of the proposed procedure by numerical simulations and a gene

friction. Even for the same material, monoatomic islands and thick clusters

been explored. Through realistic molecular dynamics simulations of the static
friction gold on graphite, an experimentally relevant system, we uncover as a
function of gold thickness a progressive drop of static friction from monolayer
islands, that are easily pinned, towards clusters, that slide more readily. The
main ingredient contributing to this thickness-induced lubricity appears to be
the increased effective rigidity of the atomic contact, acting to reduce the
cluster interdigitation with the substrate. A second element which plays a role
is lateral contact size, which can accommodate the solitons typical of the
incommensurate interface only above a critical contact diameter, which is
larger for monolayer islands than for thick clusters. The two effects concur to
make clusters more lubric than islands, and large sizes more lubric than
smaller ones. These conclusions are expected to be of broader applicability in
diverse nanotribological systems, where the role played by static, and dynamic,
friction is generally quite important.

approach to rate calculation is based on invariant manifolds and avoids the use

on a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme that searches the entire 3D motion space

integrated into the BnB scheme, which speeds up the new method while

define positive feedback loops with the potential for bistability and

exhibit bistability even in the absence of cooperativity in the regulation of

in which two regions of monostability with linear threshold response are
separated by a region of bistability with digital response.
  Using the linear noise approximation (LNA), we further show that the
coefficient of variation (a measure of noise), associated with the protein
levels in the steady state, has a lower magnitude in the case of the four-gene

excitonic coherence lifetime in two representative TMD materials (WS$_2$ and
MoSe$_2$) within a joint study combining microscopic theory with optical
experiments. We show that the excitonic coherence lifetime is determined by
phonon-induced intra- and intervalley scattering into dark excitonic states.
Remarkably, and in accordance with the theoretical prediction, we find an
efficient exciton relaxation in WS$_2$ through phonon emission at all
temperatures.

results revealed two phases in the steady state. An active phase for
$p<p_{\text{cri}}$ has one connected network of agents using different
strategies who are continually interacting and taking adaptive actions. A
frozen phase for $p>p_{\text{cri}}$ has three separate clusters of agents using
only R, P, and S, respectively with terminated adaptive actions. A mean-field
theory of link densities in co-evolving network is formulated in a general way

point out the different probabilities of winning, losing, and drawing a game

in particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed
""pixel-by-pixel"". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a

mutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized)
decoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due
to their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by
locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light
driven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended
on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains,
which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our

magnetic tube filled with the plasma. The parts of the tube at the two sides of
the thread are filled with hot rarefied plasma. We assume that there are flows
of rarefied plasma toward the thread caused by the plasma evaporation at the
magnetic tube footpoints. Our main assumption is that the hot plasma is
instantaneously accommodated by the thread when it arrives at the thread, and
its temperature and density become equal to those of the thread. Then we derive
the system of ordinary differential equations describing the thread dynamics.
We consider linear and nonlinear oscillation. The nonlinearity reduces the
damping time, however this reduction is small. The damping time is inversely
proportional to the accretion rate. We also obtain that the oscillation periods
decrease with time. However even for the largest initial oscillation amplitude
considered in our article the period reduction does not exceed 20%. We conclude
that the mass accretion can damp the motion of the threads rapidly. Thus, this
mechanism can explain the observed strong damping of large-amplitude
longitudinal oscillations. In addition, the damping time can be used to
determine the mass accretion rate and indirectly the coronal heating.

investigated using the dressed collisionless Fokker-Planck equation and the

the diffusion fluxes are found using the epicyclic approximation, while
assuming that only radially tightly wound transient spirals are sustained by
the disc. This yields simple quadratures for the drift and diffusion
coefficients, providing a clear understanding of the positions of maximum
vertical orbital diffusion within the disc, induced by fluctuations either
external or due to the finite number of particles. These thick limits also
offer a consistent derivation of a thick disc Toomre parameter, which is shown
to be exponentially boosted by the ratio of the vertical to radial scale
heights. Dressed potential fluctuations within the disc statistically induce a
vertical bending of a subset of resonant orbits, triggering the corresponding
increase in vertical velocity dispersion. When applied to a tepid stable
tapered disc perturbed by shot noise, these two frameworks reproduce
qualitatively the formation of ridges of resonant orbits towards larger
vertical actions, as found in direct numerical simulations, but overestimates
the time-scale involved in their appearance. Swing amplification is likely
needed to resolve this discrepancy, as demonstrated in the case of razor-thin
discs. Other sources of thickening are also investigated, such as fading
sequences of slowing bars, or the joint evolution of a population of giant

reconstruction to the number of holes contained within the Fermi surface volume

charge-density wave order, we show that there exists a relationship between the
ordering wave vector, the hole doping and the cross-sectional area of the
reconstructed Fermi surface whose precise form depends on the volume of the
starting Fermi surface. We consider a `large' starting Fermi surface comprising
1+p hole carriers, as predicted by band structure calculations, and a `small'
starting Fermi surface comprising p hole carriers, as proposed in models in
which the Coulomb repulsion remains the dominant energy. Using the
reconstructed Fermi surface cross-sectional area obtained in quantum
oscillation experiments in YBa2Cu3O6+x and HgBa2CuO4+x and the established
methods for estimating the chemical hole doping, we find the ordering vectors
obtained from x-ray scattering measurements to show a close correspondence with
those expected for the small starting Fermi surface. We therefore show the
Coulomb repulsion to remain largely unscreened throughout the entire underdoped
regime where the pseudogap exists and further show that the quantum oscillation
frequency and charge-density wave vectors provide accurate estimates for the
number of holes contributing to the Fermi surface volume.

model. The Cox model may, however, be misspecified, and its proportionality
assumption may not always be fulfilled. An alternative approach for survival
prediction is random forests for survival outcomes. The standard split
criterion for random survival forests is the log-rank test statistics, which
favors splitting variables with many possible split points. Conditional
inference forests avoid this split variable selection bias. However, linear
rank statistics are utilized by default in conditional inference forests to
select the optimal splitting variable, which cannot detect non-linear effects
in the independent variables. An alternative is to use maximally selected rank
statistics for the split point selection. As in conditional inference forests,
splitting variables are compared on the p-value scale. However, instead of the
conditional Monte-Carlo approach used in conditional inference forests, p-value
approximations are employed. We describe several p-value approximations and the
implementation of the proposed random forest approach. A simulation study
demonstrates that unbiased split variable selection is possible. However, there
is a trade-off between unbiased split variable selection and runtime. In
benchmark studies of prediction performance on simulated and real datasets the
new method performs better than random survival forests if informative
dichotomous variables are combined with uninformative variables with more
categories and better than conditional inference forests if non-linear
covariate effects are included. In a runtime comparison the method proves to be
computationally faster than both alternatives, if a simple p-value
approximation is used.

kcal/mol for systems like CCl4) between orbital-based and CCSD-F12b basis set
limits disappear if basis sets with additional radial flexibility, such as
ACV{5,6}Z, are used for the orbital calculation. Counterpoise calculations
reveal that, while TAEs with V5Z-F12 basis sets are nearly free of BSSE,
orbital calculations have significant BSSE even with AV(6+d)Z basis sets,
leading to non-negligible differences between raw and counterpoise-corrected
extrapolated limits. This latter problem is greatly reduced by switching to
ACV{5,6}Z core-valence basis sets, or simply adding an additional zeta to just
the valence orbitals. Previous reports that all-electron approaches like HEAT
lead to different CCSD(T) limits than valence limit+CV correction approaches
like FPD and W4 theory can be rationalized in terms of the greater radial
flexibility of core-valence basis sets. W4-F12 is found to agree slightly

decoherence in typical quantum wells with an arbitrary magnetic field. In such
systems, the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the main
crystallographic directions is crucial, owing to the lack of spin-rotation
symmetry. For typical high mobility samples, relaxation anisotropies in the
motional narrowing limit owing to the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin
orbit coupling are calculated. We also include the effect of the
cubic-in-momentum terms. Although commonly ignored in literature, the latter
were experimentally evidenced by the observation of strong anisotropy in spin
decoherence measurements by different experimental groups and has long remained
unexplained.

as in Bouchitt\'e and Felbacq (C.R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris 339(5):377--382,
2004), where the high contrast in the parameter leads to unusual effective
parameters in the homogenized equation. We revisit existing homogenization
approaches for this special setting and analyze the stability of the two-scale
solution with respect to the wavenumber and the data. This includes a new
stability result for solutions to the Helmholtz equation with discontinuous
diffusion matrix. The HMM is defined as direct discretization of the two-scale
limit equation.
  With this approach we are able to show quasi-optimality and an a priori error
estimate under a resolution condition that inherits its dependence on the
wavenumber from the stability constant for the analytical problem. Numerical
experiments confirm our theoretical convergence results and examine the
resolution condition. Moreover, the numerical simulation gives a good insight
and explanation of the physical phenomenon of frequency band gaps.

Method for the Helmholtz equation with high contrast, arXiv:1605.03400, 2016).
There, an unavoidable resolution condition on the mesh sizes in terms of the

finite element literature. Following ideas of (Gallistl, Peterseim. Comput.

functions for the trial space, whereas the test functions are enriched by
solutions of subscale problems (solved on a finer grid) on local patches.
Provided that the oversampling parameter $m$, which indicates the size of the
patches, is coupled logarithmically to the wave number, we obtain a
quasi-optimal method under a reasonable resolution of a few degrees of freedom
per wave length, thus overcoming the pollution effect. In the two-scale

before merger. That allows to show the effects on the gravitational wave phase
evolution, radiated energy and angular momentum due to: the use of different
EOSs, the orbital eccentricity present in the initial data and the initial
separation (in the simulation) between the two stars.
  Our results show that eccentricity has a major role in the discrepancy
between numerical and analytical waveforms until the very last few orbits,
where ""tidal"" effects and missing high-order post-Newtonian coefficients also
play a significant role.
  We test different methods for extrapolating the gravitational wave signal
extracted at finite radii to null infinity. We show that an effective procedure
for integrating the Newman-Penrose $\psi_4$ signal to obtain the gravitational
wave strain $h$ is to apply a simple high-pass digital filter to $h$ after a
time domain integration, where only the two physical motivated integration
constants are introduced. That should be preferred to the more common
procedures of introducing additional integration constants, integrating in the

the research on the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems has been
undertaken in recent years. It is expected that the spectral and energy
efficiencies in 5G mobile communication systems should be ten-fold higher than
the ones in the fourth generation (4G) mobile communication systems. Therefore,
it is important to further exploit the potential of spatial multiplexing of
multiple antennas. In the last twenty years, multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) antenna techniques have been considered as the key techniques to
increase the capacity of wireless communication systems. When a large-scale
antenna array (which is also called massive MIMO) is equipped in a
base-station, or a large number of distributed antennas (which is also called

that the frameshift frequency can be strongly regulated also by the density of

$z\sim 2$, and investigate galaxy evolution from $z\sim 0$ to $2$ in
conjunction with 208,529 local SDSS galaxies and 9 green pea galaxies (GPs). In
contrast with most of the recent studies, we obtain the N/O ratio, {$q_{\rm

{[O\,\textsc{iii}]} $\lambda$4363 and {O\,\textsc{iii}]} $\lambda$1665 lines.
Based on these reliable measurements, we find that there exist $z\sim 2$
galaxies with an excess of N/O falling beyond the local average of N/O--O/H
relation, while the majority of the $z\sim 2$ galaxies have the N/O ratios
nearly comparable with $z\sim 0$ galaxies in the N/O--stellar mass relation.
Our galaxies place the upper limit of N/O ratio $\log ({\rm N/O})\le -1.26$ on
average, suggesting that the N/O ratio evolves, if at all, by $<0.17$ dex.
Exploiting our reliable measurements free from the N/O--{$q_{\rm ion}$}--O/H
degeneracies, we identify, for the first time, that $z\sim 2$ galaxies with
offsets in the BPT diagram indicate either 1) only an N/O excess, 2) only a
{$q_{\rm ion}$} excess, or 3) both N/O and {$q_{\rm ion}$} excesses. We argue
that the BPT offsets at $z\sim 2$ are not made by one of 1)--3) galaxy
populations alone, but the composite of 1)--3) populations. We confirm that
these 1)--3) populations also exist at $z\sim 0$, such as GPs and SDSS low-mass

  how novelty arises from gradual network evolution",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theory of interaction-based evolution argues that, at the most basic
level of analysis, there is a third alternative for how adaptive evolution
works besides a) accidental mutation and natural selection and b) Lamarckism,
namely, c) information provided by natural selection on the fit between the
organism and its environment is absorbed by non-accidental mutation. This
non-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due
to evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ
cells. However, this theory has left a fundamental problem open: If mutational
mechanisms are not Lamarckian---if they are not ""aware"" of the environment and
the macroscale phenotype---then how could heritable novelty be due to anything
other than accidental mutation? This paper aims to address this question by
arguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as
enacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with
gene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural
selection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action
creates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the
inherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with
other such elements, thus explaining nature's tendency for cooption. Novelty
thus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level
evolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,
from cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of
behavior and instinct at the organismal level. Finally, the nature of
mutational mechanisms and the need to study them in detail are described, and a
connection is drawn between evolution and learning.

anisotropic electronic and optical properties that might be exploited for a
wide range of technological applications. In this respect, the thermal
properties are particularly important both to predict its room temperature
operation and to determine its thermoelectric potential. From this point of
view, one of the most spectacular and poorly understood phenomena is, indeed,
the BP temperature-induced band-gap opening: when temperature is increased the
fundamental band-gap increases instead of decreasing. This anomalous thermal
dependence has also been observed, recently, in its monolayer counterpart. In
this work, based on \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we present an explanation
for this long known, and yet not fully explained, effect. We show that it
arises from a combination of harmonic and lattice thermal expansion
contributions, which are, in fact, highly interwined. We clearly narrow down
the mechanisms that cause this gap opening by identifying the peculiar atomic
vibrations that drive the anomaly. The final picture we give explains both the
BP anomalous band-gap opening and the frequency increase with increasing volume
(tension effect).

conditions for ballisticity (positive linear speed) and for sub-ballisticity
(zero linear speed), and the existence in the ballistic regime of an invariant
distribution for the environment viewed from the walker, which is mutually
absolutely continuous with respect to the original law of the environment. If
the point process is a renewal process, the aforementioned conditions result in
a sharp criterion for ballisticity. Interestingly, the speed is not always

1566, a nearby grand design spiral galaxy, sampled out to a Galactocentric
radius of $\approx 5.5$ kpc. The shape of the mass-limited age distribution
shows negligible variation with radial distance from the centre of the galaxy,
and demonstrates three separate sections, with a steep beginning, flat middle
and steep end. The luminosity function can be approximated by a power law at
lower luminosities with evidence of a truncation at higher luminosity. The
power law section of the luminosity function of the galaxy is best fitted by an
index $\approx -2$, in agreement with other studies, and is found to agree with
a model luminosity function, which uses an underlying Schechter mass function.
The recovered power law slope of the mass distribution shows a slight
steepening as a function of galactocentric distance, but this is within error
estimates. It also displays a possible truncation at the high mass end.
Additionally, the cluster formation efficiency ($\Gamma$) and the specific
U-band luminosity of clusters ($T_L(U)$) are calculated for NGC 1566 and are
consistent with values for similar galaxies. A difference in NGC 1566, however,
is that the fairly high star formation rate is in contrast with a low
$\Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\Gamma$, indicating that $\Gamma$ can only be said to
depend strongly on $\Sigma_{SFR}$, not the star formation rate.

establishment of theoretical bounds for the parameters of FHSs as well as on
the construction of optimal FHSs with respect to the bounds. Peng and Fan
(2004) derived two lower bounds on the maximum nontrivial Hamming correlation
of an FHS set, which is an important indicator in measuring the performance of
an FHS set employed in practice.
  In this paper, we obtain two main results. We study the construction of new
optimal frequency-hopping sequence sets by using cyclic codes over finite
fields. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cyclic code of length $n$ over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ such that $\mathcal{C}$ contains the one-dimensional subcode $
\mathcal{C}_0=\{(\alpha,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha)\in \mathbb{F}_q^n\,|\,\alpha\in
\mathbb{F}_q\}. $ Two codewords of $\mathcal{C}$ are said to be equivalent if
one can be obtained from the other through applying the cyclic shift a certain
number of times. We present a necessary and sufficient condition under which
the equivalence class of any codeword in $\mathcal{C}\setminus\mathcal{C}_0$
has size $n$. This result addresses an open question raised by Ding {\it et
al.} in \cite{Ding09}. As a consequence, three new classes of optimal FHS sets
with respect to the Singleton bound are obtained, some of which are also
optimal with respect to the Peng-Fan bound at the same time. We also show that
the two Peng-Fan bounds are, in fact, identical.

thin films can be driven across the percolation transition by modest surface
charge densities \emph{via} surface-assisted bulk percolation. If percolation
is associated with the onset of ferromagnetism, as in LSCO, we further
demonstrate that the presence of critical magnetic clusters extending from the

important task, arising often in bioinformatics and neuroimaging.
Computationally, this task can be formulated as jointly estimating multiple

mostly focused on sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) and can't identify
context-specific edge patterns directly. We, therefore, propose a novel
approach, SIMULE (detecting Shared and Individual parts of MULtiple graphs

automatically infers both specific edge patterns that are unique to each
context and shared interactions preserved among all the contexts. Through the
L1 constrained formulation, this problem is cast as multiple independent
subtasks of linear programming that can be solved efficiently in parallel. In
addition to Gaussian data, SIMULE can also handle multivariate Nonparanormal
data that greatly relaxes the normality assumption that many real-world
applications do not follow. We provide a novel theoretical proof showing that
SIMULE achieves a consistent result at the rate O(log(Kp)/n_{tot}). On multiple
synthetic datasets and two biomedical datasets, SIMULE shows significant
improvement over state-of-the-art multi-sGGM and single-UGM baselines.

find that for realistic system sizes $U$ is of the order of eV, a value that is
orders of magnitude higher than the previously reported estimates. Finally,
when edges are considered, we show that $U$ is very sensitive to the vacancy

$B(F_{n+1})=A(F_n)$ for all $n \geq 0$ and (2) the functions $B(F_n)$ pairwise

enhancement factors (AFEFs) for small field emitter arrays. Using the ""floating
sphere at emitter-plate potential"" (FSEPP) model, it re-examines the
electrostatics and mathematics of three simple systems of identical post-like
emitters. For the isolated emitter, various approaches are noted. On need
consider only the effects of sphere charges and (for separated emitters) image
charges. For the 2-emitter system, formulas are found for ""charge-blunting"" and
""neighbour-field"" effects, for widely spaced and ""sufficiently closely spaced""
emitters. Mutual charge-blunting is always dominant, with a related (negative)
fractional AFEF-change {\delta}_two. For sufficiently small emitter spacing c,
|{\delta}_two| varies as 1/c; for large spacing, |{\delta}_two| decreases as
1/c^3. In a 3-emitter linear array, differential charge-blunting and
differential neighbor-field effects occur, but the former are dominant, and
cause the ""exposed"" outer emitters to have higher AFEF ({\gamma}_0) than the
central emitter ({\gamma}_1). Formulas are found for the exposure ratio
{\Xi}={\gamma}_0/{\gamma}_1, for large and for sufficiently small separations.
The FSEPP model for an isolated emitter has accuracy around 30%. Line-charge
models (LCMs) are an alternative, but an apparent difficulty with recent LCM
models is identified. Better descriptions of array electrostatics may involve
developing good fitting equations for AFEFs derived from accurate numerical
solution of Laplace's equation, perhaps with equation form(s) guided
qualitatively by FSEPP-model results. In existing fitting formulas, the
AFEF-reduction decreases exponentially as c increases, which differs from
FSEPP-model formulas. FSEPP models might provide a useful guide to the
qualitative behaviour of small field emitter clusters larger than those
investigated.

stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motions. We
develop two innovative sensitivity analyses when the Hurst parameter $H$ of the

  In both cases we exhibit the Lipschitz continuity w.r.t. $H$ around the value

good proxy model as long as the Hurst parameter remains close to

the nature of the transitions are modified in the coupled dynamics. In the
complex adoption layer, the critical threshold required for extension of
adoption increases with interlayer connectivity whereas in the case of an

addition, the transition can become continuous depending on the detailed inter

This in particular shows that the previously best, trivial upper bound of
O(n^2) is asymptotically not tight. In the logic setting, this translates to
the statement that if two graphs of size n can be distinguished by a formula in
first-order logic with counting with 3 variables (i.e., in C3), then they can
also be distinguished by a C3-formula that has quantifier depth at most
O(n^2/log(n)).
  To prove the result we define a game between two players that enables us to
decouple the causal dependencies between the processes happening simultaneously
over several iterations of the algorithm. This allows us to treat large color
classes and small color classes separately. As part of our proof we show that
for graphs with bounded color class size, the number of iterations until
stabilization is at most linear in the number of vertices. This also yields a
corresponding statement in first-order logic with counting.
  Similar results can be obtained for the respective logic without counting
quantifiers, i.e., for the logic L3.

neuroimaging community over the past few years. At the group level, most MVPA
studies adopt an ""information based"" approach in which the sign of the effect
of individual subjects is discarded and a non-directional summary statistic is
carried over to the second level. This is in contrast to a directional
""activation based"" approach typical in univariate group level analysis, in
which both signal magnitude and sign are taken into account. The transition
from examining effects in one voxel at a time vs. several voxels (univariate
vs. multivariate) has thus tacitly entailed a transition from directional to
non-directional signal definition at the group level. While a directional
group-level MVPA approach implies that individuals have similar multivariate
spatial patterns of activity, in a non-directional approach each individual may
have a distinct spatial pattern. Using an experimental dataset, we show that
directional and non-directional group-level MVPA approaches uncover distinct
brain regions with only partial overlap. We propose a method to quantify the
degree of spatial similarity in activation patterns over subjects. Applied to
an auditory task, we find higher values in auditory regions compared to control
regions.

during late summer for multiple Martian years, to monitor the summertime water
cycle in order to place quantitative limits on the amount of water ice
deposited and sublimed in late summer.
  We establish here for the first time the summer cycle of water ice absorption
band signatures on the north polar cap. We show that in a key region in the
interior of the north polar cap, the absorption band depths grow until Ls=120,
when they begin to shrink, until they are obscured at the end of summer by the
north polar hood. This behavior is transferable over the entire north polar
cap, where in late summer regions 'flip' from being net sublimating into net
condensation mode. This transition or 'mode flip' happens earlier for regions
closer to the pole, and later for regions close to the periphery of the cap.
  The observations and calculations presented herein estimate that on average a
water ice layer ~70 microns thick is deposited during the Ls=135-164 period.
This is far larger than the results of deposition on the south pole during

galaxies of earlier morphological types and for high stellar mass galaxies.
  Applying our aperture corrections to a sample of galaxies from the SDSS
survey at 0.02<=z<=0.3 shows that the average difference between fiber-based
and aperture corrected oxygen abundances, for different galaxy stellar mass and
redshift ranges, reaches typically to ~11%, depending on the abundance
calibration used. This average difference is found to be systematically biased,
though still within the typical uncertainties of oxygen abundances derived from
empirical calibrations. Caution must be exercised when using observations of
galaxies for small radii (e.g. below 0.5R_eff) given the high dispersion shown
around the median growth curves.

and provides key challenges for our ability to predict a system's response to
perturbations. Near critical transitions small causes can lead to large effects
and - for all practical purposes - irreversible changes in the properties of
the system. The Earth climate is multistable: present astronomical and
astrophysical conditions support two stable regimes, the warm climate we live
in, and a snowball climate, characterized by global glaciation. We first
provide an overview of methods and ideas relevant for studying the climate
response to forcings and focus on the properties of critical transitions.
Following an idea developed by Eckhardt and co. for the investigation of
multistable turbulent flows, we study the global instability giving rise to the
snowball/warm multistability in the climate system by identifying the climatic
edge state, a saddle embedded in the boundary between the two basins of
attraction of the stable climates. The edge state attracts initial conditions
belonging to such a boundary and is the gate facilitating noise-induced
transitions between competing attractors. We use a simplified yet Earth-like
climate model constructed by coupling a primitive equations model of the
atmosphere with a simple diffusive ocean. We refer to the climatic edge states
as Melancholia states. We study their dynamics, their symmetry properties, and
we follow a complex set of bifurcations. We find situations where the
Melancholia state has chaotic dynamics. In these cases, the basin boundary
between the two basins of attraction is a strange geometric set with a nearly
zero codimension, and relate this feature to the time scale separation between
instabilities occurring on weather and climatic time scales. We also discover a
new stable climatic state characterized by non-trivial symmetry properties.

a component of their wave function extending into higher spatial dimensions.
This model postulates an extension of the Schrodinger equation to include a 4th
and 5th spatial component. A higher-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator
confining potential localizes particles into 3-d space, characterizing the
brane tension which confines Standard Model particles to the sub-manifold.
Quantum effects allow a non-zero probability for a particle's evanescent
existence in the higher dimensions, and suggest an experimental test for the
validity of this model via particles being temporarily excited into the first
excited state of the extra-dimensional potential well, in which their
probability of existing in 3-d space transiently drops to zero. Several
consistency checks of the outcomes of this extra-dimensional model are included
in this paper. Among the outcomes of this model are: a match with the quantum
phenomenon of zitterbewegung; the predicted intrinsic spin angular momentum is
of order h/2Pi; the magnetic moment of the electron is determined with a
gyromagnetic ratio of 2; the nuclear force hard core radius is accurately
predicted; the ratio of the up and down quark masses is found to be mu/md=0.56,
consistent with QCD theory; a self-consistent derivation of special
relativistic effects is given; possible explanations of the Planck mass and
Planck length, and a possible explanation of the origin of electric charge. In
addition, a simple application of higher-dimensional particle effects to the
astrophysics of stars is briefly examined, showing that radical physical
inconsistencies are not evident. Finally, this model suggests a possible
explanation of dark matter as the fractional probability manifestations of a
ladder of the higher-dimensional symmetric excited states of ordinary
particles.

user one needs to maximize the channel capacity for power transport. In
communications technologies, the concept of MIMO (multiple input, multiple
output) exploits the idea of sending signals via many different rays which may
reach the receiver. However, if we are concerned with the task of energy
transfer, still only one mode is exploited, even if multiple antennas are used
to send power to the receiver. In the near-field scenario, this is the magnetic
dipole mode of receiving coil antennas. In the far-field scenario, this is the
propagating plane wave TEM mode. Recently, it was shown that using special
artificial materials it is possible to ensure that all electromagnetic modes of
free space are conjugately matched to the modes of a material body and, thus,
all modes deliver power to the body in the most effective way. Such a
fascinating feature is acquired because the conjugate matching does not concern
only the propagating modes but, most importantly, is applied to all evanescent
modes. However, coupling to higher-order (mostly evanescent) modes is weak and
disappears in the limit of an infinite planar boundary. We show that properly
perturbing the surface of the receiving or emitting body with, for example,
randomly distributed small particles we can open up channels for
super-radiation into far zone. The currents induced in the small particles act
as secondary sources which send the energy to travel far away from the surface
and, reciprocally, receive power from far-located sources. We theoretically
predict about 20-fold power transfer enhancement between the conjugately
matched power-receiving body (as compared with the ideal black body) and
far-zone sources. Reciprocally, the proposed structure radiates about 20 times
more power into far zone as compared with the same source over a perfect
reflector.

fractures endowed with spatially-varying interfacial condition
(e.g.~partially-closed fractures, hydraulic fractures). The proposed indicator
functional carries a superior localization property with no significant
sensitivity to the fracture's contact condition, measurement errors, and
illumination frequency. This is accomplished through the paradigm of the
$F_\sharp$-factorization technique and the recently developed Generalized
Linear Sampling Method (GLSM) applied to elastodynamics. The direct scattering
problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the fracture surface is
illuminated by a set of incident plane waves, while monitoring the induced
scattered field in the form of (elastic) far-field patterns. The analysis of
the well-posedness of the forward problem leads to an admissibility condition
on the fracture's (linearized) contact parameters. This in turn contributes
toward establishing the applicability of the $F_\sharp$-factorization method,
and consequently aids the formulation of a convex GLSM cost functional whose
minimizer can be computed without iterations. Such minimizer is then used to
construct a robust fracture indicator function, whose performance is
illustrated through a set of numerical experiments. For completeness, the
results of the GLSM reconstruction are compared to those obtained by the
classical linear sampling method (LSM).
