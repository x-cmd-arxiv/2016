X-channel and $K$-user SISO X-network in fast fading environment. It is assumed
that the transmitters have access to synergistic alternating channel state
information (CSI). Specifically, the CSIT alternates between three states,
namely, perfect, delayed and no-CSIT, in a certain manner to enable these
states to work together cooperatively. These states are associated with
fractions of time denoted by $\lambda_P$, $\lambda_D$ \text{and} $\lambda_N$,
respectively. For the two-user $X$-channel, simple upper bound is developed to
prove the tightness of the achievability result of $4/3$ DoF under a certain
distribution of the availability of three CSIT states for
$\Lambda(\lambda_P=1/3, \lambda_D= 1/3, \lambda_N=1/3)$. For the $K$-user
$X$-network, it is shown that the sum Degrees of freedom (DoF) is at least
$2K/(K + 1)$, using two-phase transmission schemes over finite symbols channel
extension and under the same distribution of the availability of
$\Lambda(\lambda_P=1/3, \lambda_D= 1/3, \lambda_N=1/3)$.This achievability
result, can be considered as a tight lower bound, coincides with the best lower
bound known for the same network but with partial output feedback in stead of
alternating CSIT. Hence, we show that the role of synergistic alternating CSIT
with distribution $\Lambda(1/3,1/3,1/3)$ is equivalent to the partial output
feedback. Also, this lower bound is strictly better than the best lower bound
known for the case of delayed CSI assumption for all values of $K$. All the
proposed transmission schemes are based on two phases transmission strategy,
namely, interference creation and interference resurrection, which exploit the
synergy of instantaneous CSI and delay CSIT to retrospectively align
interference in the subsequent channel uses.

Fabolas, which models loss and training time as a function of dataset size and
automatically trades off high information gain about the global optimum against
computational cost. Experiments optimizing support vector machines and deep

correlations on the entanglement entropy, which modify the sub-leading behavior
for large subsystem sizes (as characterized by the dimensionless parameter x=kF
L_A, where kF is the Fermi momentum and L_A the linear subsystem size), but
leave the leading order unchanged relative to the non-interacting case.
Moreover, we find that the onset of the sub-leading asymptotic regime is at
surprisingly small x=2-4. We provide further insight into the entanglement
properties of this system by analyzing the spectrum of the entanglement
Hamiltonian of the two-body problem from weak to strong coupling. The low-lying
entanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling
is varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and
scale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum
appears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical
characterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as
the coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum
represents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In
contrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the
noninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees
that our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and
represent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were

as a linear combination of the multiple available order parameters that

unbinding. We pay special attention to determining and quantifying the degree
to which water molecules should be included in the RC. Using SGOOP with
under-sampled biased simulations, we predict that water plays a distinct role
in the reaction coordinate for unbinding in the case when the ligand is
sterically constrained to move along an axis of symmetry. This prediction is
validated through extensive calculations of the unbinding times through
metadynamics, and by comparison through detailed balance with unbiased

sets is considered. Each link between a user and a BS antenna set forms a
jointly correlated Rician fading channel. The analysis is based on
operator-valued free probability theory, which broadens the range of
applicability of free probability techniques tremendously. By replacing
independent Gaussian random matrices with operator-valued random variables
satisfying certain operator-valued freeness relations, the free deterministic
equivalent of the considered channel Gram matrix is obtained. The Shannon
transform of the free deterministic equivalent is derived, which provides an
approximate expression for the ergodic input-output mutual information of the
channel. The sum-rate capacity achieving input covariance matrices are also
derived based on the approximate ergodic input-output mutual information. The
free deterministic equivalent results are easy to compute, and simulation
results show that these approximations are numerically accurate and

differ in their cost for unit delay and this is modeled as a continuous random
variable with a distribution $F.$ We also assume that each server charges an
admission price to each customer that decide to join its queue. We first
consider the monopoly problem where both the servers belong to a single
operator. The heterogeneity of the customer makes the analysis of the problem
difficult. The difficulty lies in the inability to characterize the equilibrium
queue arrival rates as a function of the admission prices. We provide an
equivalent formulation with the queue arrival rates as the optimization
variable simplifying the analysis for revenue rate maximization for the
monopoly. We then consider the duopoly problem where each server competes with
the other server to maximize its revenue rate. For the duopoly problem, the
interest is to obtain the set of admission prices satisfying the Nash
equilibrium conditions. While the problem is in general difficult to analyze,
we consider the special case when the two servers are identical. For such a
duopoly system, we obtain the necessary condition for existence of symmetric
Nash equilibrium of the admission prices. The knowledge of the distribution $F$
characterizing the heterogeneity of the customers is necessary to solve the
monopoly and the duopoly problem. However, for most practical scenarios, the
functional form of $F$ may not be known to the system operator and in such
cases, the revenue maximizing prices cannot be determined. In the last part of
the paper, we provide a simple method to estimate the distribution $F$ by
suitably varying the admission prices. We illustrate the method with some
numerical examples.

address an open problem announced at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT)
2015. With no unrealistic assumption, we first prove the following statements
for the squared loss function of deep linear neural networks with any depth and
any widths: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave, 2) every local
minimum is a global minimum, 3) every critical point that is not a global
minimum is a saddle point, and 4) there exist ""bad"" saddle points (where the
Hessian has no negative eigenvalue) for the deeper networks (with more than
three layers), whereas there is no bad saddle point for the shallow networks
(with three layers). Moreover, for deep nonlinear neural networks, we prove the
same four statements via a reduction to a deep linear model under the
independence assumption adopted from recent work. As a result, we present an
instance, for which we can answer the following question: how difficult is it
to directly train a deep model in theory? It is more difficult than the
classical machine learning models (because of the non-convexity), but not too
difficult (because of the nonexistence of poor local minima). Furthermore, the
mathematically proven existence of bad saddle points for deeper models would
suggest a possible open problem. We note that even though we have advanced the
theoretical foundations of deep learning and non-convex optimization, there is
still a gap between theory and practice.

problem over a network. The objective is to optimize a global function formed
by a sum of local functions, using only local computation and communication.
Literature has developed consensus-based distributed (sub)gradient descent
(DGD) methods and has shown that they have the same convergence rate
$O(\frac{\log t}{\sqrt{t}})$ as the centralized (sub)gradient methods (CGD)
when the function is convex but possibly nonsmooth. However, when the function
is convex and smooth, under the framework of DGD, it is unclear how to harness
the smoothness to obtain a faster convergence rate comparable to CGD's
convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that,
despite using the same amount of communication per iteration as DGD, can
effectively harnesses the function smoothness and converge to the optimum with
a rate of $O(\frac{1}{t})$. If the objective function is further strongly
convex, our algorithm has a linear convergence rate. Both rates match the
convergence rate of CGD. The key step in our algorithm is a novel gradient
estimation scheme that uses history information to achieve fast and accurate
estimation of the average gradient. To motivate the necessity of history
information, we also show that it is impossible for a class of distributed
algorithms like DGD to achieve a linear convergence rate without using history
information even if the objective function is strongly convex and smooth.

angular momentum from their surfaces, e.g. via stellar winds. Despite the
complexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of
angular momentum loss by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful
framework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation and
age and magnetic field strength. Here, a spindown model is proposed where loss
of angular momentum by magnetic fields is evolved dynamically, instead of being
kinematically prescribed. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and
magnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our
previous work on a dynamo model which incorporates the nonlinear feedback
mechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. Our extended model reproduces key
observations and explains the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow
rotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate $\Omega$
vs. time (age), magnetic field strength $|B|$ vs. rotation rate, and frequency
of magnetic field $\omega_{cyc}$ vs. rotation rate. For fast rotating stars we
find: (i) an exponential spindown $\Omega \propto e^{-1.35t}$, with $t$
measured in Gyrs, (ii) $|B|$ saturates for higher rotation rate, (iii)
$\omega_{cyc} \propto \Omega^{0.85}$. For slow rotating stars we obtain: (i) a
power law spindown $\Omega \propto t^{-0.52}$, (ii) $|B|$ scales almost
linearly with rotation rate, (iii) $\omega_{cyc} \propto \Omega^{1.16}$. The
results obtained are in good agreement with observations. The Vaughan-Preston
gap is consistently explained in our model by the shortest spindown timescale
in this transition from fast to slow rotators. Our results highlight the
importance of self-regulation of magnetic fields and rotation by direct and
indirect interactions involving nonlinear feedback in stellar evolution.

a terrestrial planet can maintain above-freezing conditions through regulation
by the carbonate-silicate cycle. Recent calculations have suggested that
planets in the outer regions of the habitable zone cannot maintain stable, warm
climates, but rather should oscillate between long, globally glaciated states
and shorter periods of climatic warmth. Such conditions, similar to 'Snowball
Earth' episodes experienced on Earth, would be inimical to the development of
complex land life, including intelligent life. Here, we build upon previous
studies with an updated an energy balance climate model to calculate this
'limit cycle' region of the habitable zone where such cycling would occur. We
argue that an abiotic Earth would have a greater CO$_2$ partial pressure than
today because plants and other biota help to enhance the storage of CO$_2$ in
soil. When we tune our abiotic model accordingly, we find that limit cycles can
occur but that previous calculations have overestimated their importance. For G
stars like the Sun, limit cycles occur only for planets with CO$_2$ outgassing

significant irradiation that can modify the properties of their atmospheres. In
order to test the atmospheric models that are used to describe these systems,
it is necessary to obtain accurate observational estimates of their physical
properties (masses, radii, temperatures, albedos). Interacting compact binary
systems provide a natural laboratory for studying strongly irradiated
sub-stellar objects. As the mass-losing secondary in these systems makes a
critical, but poorly understood transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar
regime, it is also strongly irradiated by the compact accretor. In fact, the
internal and external energy fluxes are both expected to be comparable in these
objects, providing access to an unexplored irradiation regime. However, the
atmospheric properties of such donors have so far remained largely unknown.
Here, we report the direct spectroscopic detection and characterisation of an
irradiated sub-stellar donor in an accreting white dwarf binary system. Our
near-infrared observations allow us to determine a model-independent mass
estimate for the donor of $M_2=0.055\pm0.008M_{\odot}$ and an average spectral
type of ${\rm L1}\pm{\rm1}$, supporting both theoretical predictions and
model-dependent observational constraints. Our time-resolved data also allow us
to estimate the average irradiation-induced temperature difference between the
day and night sides on the sub-stellar donor, $\Delta{\rm T}\simeq57$~K, and
the maximum difference between the hottest and coolest parts of its surface, of
$\Delta{\rm T}_{max}\simeq200$~K. The observations are well described by a
simple geometric reprocessing model with a bolometric (Bond) albedo of
$A_B<0.54$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level, consistent with high reprocessing
efficiency, but poor lateral heat redistribution in the donor's atmosphere.

Comparing the radio light curves from previous and subsequent outbursts of this

shows that the typical long and short outbursts of this system exhibit
reproducible radio outbursts that do not vary significantly between outbursts,

that the radio emission appears to have been triggered at the same time as the
initial X-ray flare, which occurs as disk material first reaches the boundary
layer. This raises the possibility that the boundary region may be involved in
jet production in accreting white dwarf systems. Our high spatial resolution
monitoring shows that the compact jet remained active throughout the outburst

fairness definition can be interpreted as demanding that given a pool of
applicants (say, for college admission or mortgages), a worse applicant is
never favored over a better one, despite a learning algorithm's uncertainty

  First, in the important special case of the classic stochastic bandits
problem (i.e., in which there are no contexts), we provide a provably fair
algorithm based on ""chained"" confidence intervals, and provide a cumulative
regret bound with a cubic dependence on the number of arms. We further show
that any fair algorithm must have such a dependence. When combined with regret
bounds for standard non-fair algorithms such as UCB, this proves a strong
separation between fair and unfair learning, which extends to the general
contextual case.
  In the general contextual case, we prove a tight connection between fairness
and the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) learning model: a KWIK algorithm for a class
of functions can be transformed into a provably fair contextual bandit
algorithm, and conversely any fair contextual bandit algorithm can be
transformed into a KWIK learning algorithm. This tight connection allows us to
provide a provably fair algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem with
a polynomial dependence on the dimension, and to show (for a different class of
functions) a worst-case exponential gap in regret between fair and non-fair

lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC). Both

equilibrium Li+/Li(s) potential. Interfacial reactions represent one way to

studies suggest that the innermost SEI layer on lithium metal surfaces should
be a thin layer of Li(2)O -- the only thermodynamically and kinetically stable

relevant to inadvertant lithium plating during battery cycling, and SEI

breaking of a $\cal PT$-symmetric $S$ matrix, now with unbalanced gain and loss
and even in the absence of gain. We show that the additional symmetry relation
provides a clear evidence of an exceptional point, even when all other
signatures of the $\cal PT$ symmetry breaking are completely erased. We also
discuss the existence of a final exceptional point in this correspondence,
which is attributed to asymmetric reflections from the two sides of the
heterostructure.

Consistent Query Answering (CQA) is the problem of computing from D the answers

all the repairs of D, i.e. the consistent instances that minimally depart from
D. Three classes of repair have been considered in the literature: those that
minimize set-theoretically the set of tuples in the symmetric difference; those
that minimize the changes of attribute values, and those that minimize the
cardinality of the set of tuples in the symmetric difference. The latter class

biology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals are
widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in
graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy
observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively
analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper
advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling
and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal
reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh
insights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior
information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as
bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally
accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on
the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing
Thikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic
interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated
by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or
the kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two
multi-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables
estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows
for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as
real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
state-of-the-art alternatives.

overdensities. However, it remains puzzling how these intense star formers are
triggered concurrently. Although an increased probability of galaxy

a subset of which have ever been tested against data. For the first time, we

on the anisotropic expansion of $(\sigma_V/H)_0 < 4.7 \times 10^{-11}$ (95%

used CMB temperature only. We also place upper limits on other modes of
anisotropic expansion, with the weakest limit arising from the regular tensor

BT-Settl models ($2770\pm100$ K). We suggest that the dominant source of this

masses on the H-R diagram using the luminosity and BT-Settl temperature. The
estimated masses are $46^{+16}_{-19}$% (2.0$\sigma$) lower than we measure

the signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the
geometric albedo of exoplanets, which could provide information about
atmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra
of planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong
absorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the
albedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the
reflected light causing the so-called Raman ghost lines. Raman scattering can
also cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a
stellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the
albedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing
constrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman
ghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in
the atmosphere, even molecules like H$_2$ or N$_2$ that do not have prominent
spectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, ghost lines
could also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere. In this

to be representative of the full KBSS-MOSFIRE spectroscopic survey. Since the
same massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and the
excitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar
population synthesis model must simultaneously match the details of the far-UV
stellar+nebular continuum and-- when inserted as the excitation source in
photoionization models-- account for all observed nebular emission line ratios.
We find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar
metallicity (Z_*/Z_{sun} ~ 0.1) but relatively high ionized gas-phase oxygen
abundances (Z_{neb}/Z_{sun} ~ 0.5), can successfully match all of the
observational constraints. We argue that this apparent discrepancy is naturally
explained by highly super-solar O/Fe [4-5 times (O/Fe)_{sun}], expected for gas
whose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. Once
the correct ionizing spectrum is identified, photoionization models reproduce
all of the observed strong emission line ratios, the direct T_e measurement of
O/H, and allow accurate measurement of the gas-phase abundance ratios of N/O
and C/O -- both of which are significantly sub-solar but, as for O/Fe, are in
remarkable agreement with abundance patterns observed in Galactic thick disk,
bulge, and halo stars with similar O/H. High nebular excitation is the rule at
high-z (and rare at low-z) because of systematically shorter enrichment
timescales (<<1 Gyr): low Fe/O environments produce harder (and longer-lived)
stellar EUV spectra at a given O/H, enhanced by dramatic effects on the
evolution of massive star binaries.

ordinary matter. In particular, we discuss minimal scenarios where the DM is a
complex scalar or a Dirac fermion coupled to operators with nonzero baryon

initial asymmetry stored in either the SM or the DM sector; the main role of
these operators is to properly $share$ the asymmetry between the two sectors,
in accordance with observations. After the chemical decoupling, the DM and SM
sectors do $not$ $care$ about each other as there is only an ineffective
communication between them. Once the DM mass is specified, the Wilson
coefficients of these operators are fixed by the requirement of the correct

demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of extended (kpc scale) low ionisation
emission-line regions (LIERs) in both star forming and quiescent galaxies. In
star forming galaxies LIER emission can be associated with diffuse ionised gas,
most evident as extra-planar emission in edge-on systems. In addition, we
identify two main classes of galaxies displaying LIER emission: `central LIER'
(cLIER) galaxies, where central LIER emission is spatially extended, but
accompanied by star formation at larger galactocentric distances, and `extended
LIER' (eLIER) galaxies, where LIER emission is extended throughout the whole
galaxy. In eLIER and cLIER galaxies, LIER emission is associated with radially
flat, low H$\alpha$ equivalent width of line emission ($<$ 3 \AA) and stellar
population indices demonstrating the lack of young stellar populations,
implying that line emission follows tightly the continuum due to the underlying
old stellar population. The H$\alpha$ surface brightness radial profiles are
always shallower than $\rm 1/r^{2}$ and the line ratio
[OIII]$\lambda$5007/[OII]$\lambda$3727,29 (a tracer of the ionisation parameter
of the gas) shows a flat gradient. This combined evidence strongly supports the
scenario in which LIER emission is not due to a central point source but to
diffuse stellar sources, the most likely candidates being hot, evolved
(post-asymptotic giant branch) stars. Shocks are observed to play a significant
role in the ionisation of the gas only in rare merging and interacting systems.

introduce the observable, $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\mathcal{B}(B\to\tau\nu_\tau)$
where, for one thing, the unknown systematics due to $\tau$ identification are
expected to largely cancel. We show that all measurements of this observable

errors, with the predictions of the SM. We stress that precise experimental
measurement and comparison with theory of the branching ratio for $B \to \tau

Furthermore, in view of the anticipated improved precision in experiments in
the next few years, in addition to $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$, host of other ratios
analogous to $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\mathcal{B}(B \to \tau \nu_{\tau})$ in the

degree of freedom into the string-net graphical calculus, which takes the form
of a branch cut located at each vertex of the underlying string-net lattice. We
also work with string-net graphs defined on arbitrary (non-trivalent) graphs,
which reveals otherwise hidden information about certain configurations of

decays by considering bounds from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic

budgeting of the various sources of error becomes increasingly important. Among
such sources, the initial data is normally not accounted for, the rationale
being that the error on the initial spacelike hypersurface is always far
smaller than the one gained during the evolution. We here consider critically
this assumption and perform a comparative analysis of the gravitational
waveforms relative to essentially the same physical binary configuration when
computed with two different initial-data codes, and then evolved with the same
evolution code. More specifically, we consider the evolution of irrotational
neutron-star binaries computed either with the pseudo-spectral code \lorene{},
or with the newly developed finite-difference code \cocal{}; both sets of
initial data are subsequently evolved with the high-order evolution code
\whiskythc{}. In this way we find that despite the initial data shows global
(local) differences that are $\lesssim 0.02\%\ (1\%)$, the gravitational-wave
phase at the merger time differs by $\sim 0.5$ radians after $\sim 3$ orbits, a
surprisingly large value. Our results highlight the highly nonlinear impact
that errors in the initial data can have on the subsequent evolution and the
importance of using exactly the same initial data when comparative studies are

different physics involved inevitably leads to abundance corrections, which
differ over varying metallicities. Spectra computed in 1D were fit to every 3D
spectrum to determine the 3D abundance correction. Early analysis revealed that
the CH molecules that make up the G-band exhibited an oxygen abundance
dependency; a higher oxygen abundance leads to weaker CH features. Nitrogen
abundances showed zero impact to CH formation. The 3D corrections are also
stronger at lower metallicity. Analysis of the 3D corrections to the G-band
allows us to assign estimations of the 3D abundance correction to most dwarf
stars presented in the literature. The 3D corrections suggest that A(C) in CEMP
stars with high A(C) would remain unchanged, but would decrease in CEMP stars
with lower A(C). It was found that the C/O ratio is an important parameter to
the G-band in 3D. Additional testing confirmed that the C/O ratio is an equally
important parameter for OH transitions under 3D. This presents a clear
interrelation between the carbon and oxygen abundances in 3D atmospheres
through their molecular species, which is not seen in 1D.

statistical model of Breit-Wigner type for chaotic scattering amplitudes which
has been shown to describe the exact analytical results for the scattering

reducible correlation functions. Consequently, the model can be used for a
detailed exploration of the key features of the cross-section correlations and
the underlying physical mechanisms. In the region of isolated resonances, the
cross-section correlations contain a dominant contribution from the
self-correlation term. For narrow states the self-correlations originate
predominantly from widely spaced states with exceptionally large partial width.
In the asymptotic region of well-overlapping resonances, the cross-section
autocorrelation functions are given in terms of the S-matrix autocorrelation
functions. For inelastic correlations, in particular, the Ericson fluctuations
rapidly dominate in that region. Agreement with known analytical and with

mergers are kilonovae: approximately isotropic radioactively-powered transients
that peak days to weeks post-merger. Key uncertainties in modeling kilonovae
include the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products---non-thermal
beta- and alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays---and the
efficiency with which they deposit their energy in the ejecta. The total
radioactive energy and the efficiency of its thermalization sets the luminosity
budget and is therefore necessary for predicting kilonova light curves. We
outline the uncertainties in r-process decay, describe the physical processes
by which the energy of the decay products is absorbed in the ejecta, and
present time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We
determine the net heating efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process
yields---in particular, the production of translead nuclei that undergo
alpha-decay---and on the ejecta's mass, velocity, composition, and magnetic
field configuration. We incorporate our results into new time-dependent,
multi-wavelength radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated
predictions of kilonova light curves. Thermalization has a substantial effect
on kilonova photometry, reducing the luminosity by a factor of roughly 2 at
peak, and by an order of magnitude or more at later times (15 days or more
after explosion). We present simple analytic fits to time-dependent net
thermalization efficiencies, which can easily be used to improve light curve
models. We briefly revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma ray
burst 130603B, and offer new estimates of the mass ejected in that event. We
find that later-time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by
alpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be
diagnostic of ejecta abundances.

that in a cylindrical capsid, at least when the genome does not interact with
the capsid, which seems to be the case in in vivo experiments. Conversely, the

the genome is attracted to the capsid proteins as the in vitro experiments.

binary mergers (mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black

radioactive decays of r-process nuclei. Emission from the dynamical ejecta with
~0.01 Msun is likely to have a luminosity of ~10^{40}-10^{41} erg s^{-1} with a
characteristic timescale of about 1 week. The spectral peak is located in red
optical or near-infrared wavelengths. A subsequent accretion disk wind may
provide an additional luminosity, or an earlier/bluer emission if it is not
absorbed by the precedent dynamical ejecta. The detection of near-infrared
excess in the afterglow of short GRB 130603B and possible optical excess in GRB
060614 supports the concept of the kilonova/macronova scenario. At 200 Mpc
distance, a typical brightness of kilonova/macronova with 0.01 Msun ejecta is
expected to be about 22 mag and the emission rapidly fades to >24 mag within
~10 days after the merger. Kilonova/macronova candidates can be distinguished
from supernovae by (1) the faster time evolution, (2) fainter absolute
magnitudes, and (3) redder colors. To effectively search for such objects,
follow-up survey observations with multiple visits within <10 days and with
multiple filters will be important. Since the high expansion velocity (v ~
0.1-0.2c) is a robust outcome of compact binary mergers, the detection of
smooth spectra will be the smoking gun to conclusively identify the GW source.

to the expectation that their chemical abundances can shed light on the metal
and dust yields of the earliest supernovae. We present our most realistic
simulation to date of the astrophysical pathway to the first metal enriched
stars. We simulate the radiative and supernova hydrodynamic feedback of a
$60\,M_\odot$ Population III star starting from cosmological initial conditions
realizing Gaussian density fluctuations. We follow the gravitational
hydrodynamics of the supernova remnant at high spatial resolution through its
freely-expanding, adiabatic, and radiative phases, until gas, now
metal-enriched, has resumed runaway gravitational collapse. Our findings are
surprising: while the Population III progenitor exploded with a low energy of
$10^{51}\,\text{erg}$ and injected an ample metal mass of $6\,M_\odot$, the
first cloud to collapse after the supernova explosion is a dense surviving
primordial cloud on which the supernova blastwave deposited metals only
superficially, in a thin, unresolved layer. The first metal-enriched stars can
form at a very low metallicity, of only $2-5\times10^{-4}\,Z_\odot$, and can
inherit the parent cloud's highly elliptical, radially extended orbit in the
dark matter gravitational potential.

inner product of the two regression vectors and a normalized inner product by
their lengths. Functional de-biased estimators (FDEs) are developed to estimate
these two co-heritability measures. In addition, estimators of quadratic

Traditional 3D contact approaches study 3D structures directly. Instead, 3D
structures can be modeled as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, network
approaches can compare proteins by comparing their PSNs. Network approaches may
improve upon traditional 3D contact approaches. We cannot use existing PSN
approaches to test this, because: 1) They rely on naive measures of network
topology. 2) They are not robust to PSN size. They cannot integrate 3) multiple

because the different data types capture complementary biological knowledge. We
address these limitations by: 1) exploiting well-established graphlet measures

remove the bias of PSN size, 3) allowing for integrating multiple PSN measures,
and 4) using ordered graphlets to combine the complementary PSN data and

statistics, as they achieve super-$\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical

challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where
integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that
the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness, which is expressed as that
the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
However, this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g., when the integrand
is a black box function), and no general theory has been established for the
convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our
contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when
the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is
less smooth than assumed. Specifically, we derive convergence rates that depend
on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of
smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces.

line from neutral hydrogen is currently limited to statistical detection and
estimation metrics (e.g., the power spectrum) due to the weakness of the

and their structure is used as a primary discriminant between the cosmological
signal and contaminating foreground extragalactic and Galactic continuum
emission. Evolution of the signal over the observing bandwidth leads to the
`line cone effect' whereby the HI structures at the start and end of the
observing band are not statistically consistent, yielding a biased estimate of

understanding the process of quantum-to-classical transitions; technologically,
it can also facilitate the detection of the microscopic signals in quantum
experiments via convenient detectors. Here, we demonstrate a scheme to
characterize micro-macro transitions based on a four-wave mixing linear optical
amplification process in a hot rubidium vapor. The linear optical amplifier
provides a large optical gain of $10^7$ for injected single-photon-level
pulses, enabling photon-number-resolving detection by average via
non-single-photon counting detectors with a large dynamic range. The scheme
exhibits strong dispersion which is sensitive to the input's change at the
single-photon level, resulting in the group-velocity delay time scaling with
$1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the average input photon number. The output probe
and conjugate modes have different coefficients of this $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling,
indicating the coefficient can serve as an efficient parameter to characterize
the specified micro-macro transitions. The demonstrated results are generally
applicable for quantum detection and optical signal processing in light-atom
interfaces. Furthermore, the present system is suitable for the study of
relevant time-resolved dynamics of the quantum-to-classical transitions.

with two realistic components: (1) one models the constant baseline and slow

out-of-focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial-frequency

background term. After subtracting the background approximated with this model,
we use Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF, Pnevmatikakis et al.

of generating an invariant ""face signature"" through training pairs of ""same""

the Multibatch estimator significantly speeds up the convergence rate of
stochastic gradient descent. Using the Multibatch method we train a deep

there is indeed a close quantitative correspondence between $\tilde{P}_n$ and
$P_n$ for a wide range of quantum states that have smooth and broad Wigner
function relative to the scale of oscillations of the Wigner function for the

  using Adversarial Samples",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs
that are specially crafted to cause a machine learning model to produce an
incorrect output. Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect
another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were
trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to
perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute
model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to
a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has
further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label
a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even
collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques
using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training
procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks
between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning
model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks
on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19%
misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the
victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in
general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their
structure.

considered in the presence of spoofing attacks which alter the data presented
to several sensors. Contrary to previous work, a generalized attack model is
employed which manipulates the data using transformations with arbitrary
functional forms determined by some attack parameters whose values are unknown
to the attacked system. For the first time, necessary and sufficient conditions
are provided under which the transformations provide a guaranteed attack
performance in terms of Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) regardless of the processing the
estimation system employs, thus defining a highly desirable attack.
Interestingly, these conditions imply that, for any such attack when the
attacked sensors can be perfectly identified by the estimation system, either
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for jointly estimating the desired and
attack parameters is singular or that the attacked system is unable to improve
the CRB for the desired vector parameter through this joint estimation even
though the joint FIM is nonsingular. It is shown that it is always possible to
construct such a highly desirable attack by properly employing a sufficiently
large dimension attack vector parameter relative to the number of quantization
levels employed, which was not observed previously. To illustrate the theory in
a concrete way, we also provide some numerical results which corroborate that
under the highly desirable attack, attacked data is not useful in reducing the

  * $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2 \lg\lg(n)/\lg(n))$ and space
$O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n \lg(n)}{\lg\lg(n)}}\right)$. In general, any

$O(\sqrt n)$, derandomizing an algorithm of Wang.
  * A popular conjecture states that 3-SUM requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the

that complex cellular machines exhibit multiple, biologically active
conformations. The structural differences between these conformations may be
subtle, but each distinct state can be remarkably long-lived, with random
interconversions between states occurring only at macroscopic timescales,
fractions of a second or longer. Though we now have proof of functional
heterogeneity in a handful of systems---enzymes, motors, adhesion
complexes---identifying and measuring it remains a formidable challenge. Here
we show that evidence of this phenomenon is more widespread than previously
known, encoded in data collected from some of the most well-established single
molecule techniques: AFM or optical tweezer pulling experiments. We present a
theoretical procedure for analyzing distributions of rupture/unfolding forces
recorded at different pulling speeds. This results in a single parameter,
quantifying the degree of heterogeneity, and also leads to bounds on the
equilibration and conformational interconversion timescales. Surveying ten
published datasets, we find heterogeneity in five of them, all with
interconversion rates slower than 10 s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we identify two
systems where additional data at realizable pulling velocities is likely to
find a theoretically predicted, but so far unobserved cross-over regime between
heterogeneous and non-heterogeneous behavior. The significance of this regime
is that it will allow far more precise estimates of the slow conformational
switching times, one of the least understood aspects of functional
heterogeneity.

account with the coherent state formalism in quantum optics. However, since
charged pion correlations are most often measured, the additional constraint of
isospin conservation, which is absent in quantum optics, needs to be taken into
account. As a consequence, correlations emerge between pions of opposite
charge. A calculation of the correlations induced by isospin conservation of
coherent emission is made for two, three- and four-pion correlation functions
and compared to the data from the LHC.

more typical bright state during an interval of 23 days. During this sudden
continuum cut-off, the broad emission line fluxes do not change, perhaps due to
the large size of the Broad Line Region (BLR), r > 23 / (1+z) days. The UV
continuum may have suffered a dramatic drop out. However, there are some
difficulties with this explanation. Another possibility is that the intrinsic
continuum did not change, but was temporarily blocked out, at least towards our
line of sight. As indicated by X-ray observations, the continuum rapidly
recovers after 42 days. A comparison of the bright state and dim states would
imply an eclipse by a dusty cloud with a reddening curve having a remarkably
sharp rise shortward of 3500{\AA}. Under the assumption of being eclipsed by a
Keplerian dusty cloud, we characterized the cloud size with our observations,
however, which is a little smaller than the 3000\AA\ continuum-emitting size

task is a severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem that is highly sensitive
to measurement noise and modeling errors. Regularized D-bar methods have shown
great promise in producing noise-robust algorithms by employing a low-pass
filtering of nonlinear (nonphysical) Fourier transform data specific to the EIT

boundaries in the scattering transform provides a means of extending the radius
of the low-pass filter to include higher frequency components in the

increases with the social relationship strength, and its gradient determines
the structures of these relationships in society as evident from an analysis of

communication volumes, such as number of characters and duration of calls,

hypothesis using an individual-based simulation where social grooming costs
were assumed to increase linearly with the social relationship strength; this
is the simplest assumption. The results indicated that this model fitted all

of bed particles by fluid forces or particle-bed impacts. Here we propose a
proxy to determine the role of impact entrainment relative to entrainment by
the mean turbulent flow: the ""bed velocity"" $V_b$, which is an effective
near-bed-surface value of the average horizontal particle velocity that
generalizes the classical slip velocity, used in studies of aeolian saltation
transport, to sediment transport in an arbitrary Newtonian fluid. We study
$V_b$ for a wide range of the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, Galileo number
$\mathrm{Ga}$, and Shields number $\Theta$ using direct sediment transport
simulations. We find that transport is fully sustained through impact
entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ is constant in natural units) when the ""impact number""
$\mathrm{Im}=\mathrm{Ga}\sqrt{s+0.5}\gtrsim20$ or $\Theta\gtrsim5/\mathrm{Im}$.
These conditions are obeyed for the vast majority of transport regimes,
including steady turbulent bedload, which has long been thought to be sustained
solely through fluid entrainment. In fact, we find that transport is fully
sustained through fluid entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ scales with the near-bed
horizontal fluid velocity) only for sufficiently viscous bedload transport at
grain scale (i.e., for $\mathrm{Im}\lesssim20$ and
$\Theta\lesssim1/\mathrm{Im}$). Finally, we do not find a strong correlation
between, $V_b$, or the classical slip velocity, and the
transport-layer-averaged horizontal particle velocity $\overline{v_x}$, which
challenges the long-standing consensus that predominant impact entrainment is
responsible for a linear scaling of the transport rate with $\Theta$. For
turbulent bedload in particular, $\overline{v_x}$ increases with $\Theta$
despite $V_b$ remaining constant, which we propose is linked to the formation
of a liquid-like bed on top of the static-bed surface.

interplay between quantum field theory and gravitation. Since these primordial
perturbations lead to the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and
eventually to the inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), they
provide a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our
understanding of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue
that remains to be satisfactorily addressed is the transition of the primordial
perturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS which can be characterized
completely in terms of classical quantities. Classical bouncing universes
provide an alternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they
can help overcome the horizon problem in a fashion very similar to inflation.
While the problem of the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial
perturbations has been investigated extensively in the context of inflation, we
find that there has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in
classical bouncing universes. In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this
problem with the example of tensor perturbations produced in classical matter
and near-matter bouncing universes. We investigate the issue mainly from two
perspectives. Firstly, we approach the problem by examining the extent of
squeezing of a quantum state associated with the tensor perturbations with the
help of the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze the issue from the
perspective of the quantum measurement problem. In particular, we study the
effects of wave function collapse, using a phenomenological model known as
continuous spontaneous localization, on the tensor power spectra. We conclude
with a discussion of results.

bounding boxes to achieve high word recall with only hundred level candidate
proposals. Next, we present a powerful textdetection network that embeds
ambiguous text category (ATC) information and multilevel region-of-interest
pooling (MLRP) for text and non-text classification and accurate localization.
Finally, we apply an iterative bounding box voting scheme to pursue high recall
in a complementary manner and introduce a filtering algorithm to retain the
most suitable bounding box, while removing redundant inner and outer boxes for
each text instance. Our approach achieves an F-measure of 0.83 and 0.85 on the
ICDAR 2011 and 2013 robust text detection benchmarks, outperforming previous
state-of-the-art results.

incident on a potential which converges to zero asymptotically is found to be
1: $R(0)=1$. But earlier, a paradoxical phenomenon of zero reflection at zero
energy ($R(0)=0$) has been revealed as a threshold anomaly. Extending the
concept of Half Bound State (HBS) of 3D, here we show that in 1D when a
symmetric (asymmetric) attractive potential well possesses a zero-energy HBS,
$R(0)=0$ $(R(0)<<1)$. This can happen only at some critical values $q_c$ of an
effective parameter $q$ of the potential well in the limit $E \rightarrow 0^+$.
We demonstrate this critical phenomenon in two simple analytically solvable
models which are square and exponential wells. However, in numerical
calculations even for these two models $R(0)=0$ is observed only as
extrapolation to zero energy from low energies, close to a precise critical
value $q_c$. By numerical investigation of a variety of potential wells, we
conclude that for a given potential well (symmetric or asymmetric), we can
adjust the effective parameter $q$ to have a low reflection at a low energy.

changes that have been associated with pulsation and flow of the actomyosin

its components. Under affine deformations (homogeneous deformation over a
spatially coarse-grained scale), the active elastomer exhibits spontaneous
oscillations, propagating waves, contractile collapse and spatiotemporal chaos.
The collective nonlinear dynamics shows nucleation, growth and coalescence of
actomyosin-dense regions which, beyond a threshold, spontaneously move as a
spatially localized traveling front towards one of the boundaries. However,
large myosin-induced contractile stresses, can lead to nonaffine deformations
due to actin turnover. This results in a transient actin network, that
naturally accommodates intranetwork flows of the actomyosin dense regions as a
consequence of filament unbinding and rebinding. Our work suggests that the
driving force for the spontaneous movement comes from the actomyosin-dense
region itself and not the cell boundary. We verify the many predictions of our

from the Large Magellanic Cloud were carried out using the Danish 1.54-m
telescope located at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The selected systems
were monitored for their times of minima, which were required to be able to
study the period changes taking place in them. In addition, many new times of
minima were derived from the photometric surveys OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and MACHO.
Methods: The O-C diagrams of minima timings were analysed using the hypothesis
of the light-travel time effect, i.e. assuming the orbital motion around a
common barycenter with the distant component. Moreover, the light curves of
these systems were also analysed using the program PHOEBE, which provided the
physical parameters of the stars. Results: For the first time, in this study we
derived the relatively short periods of modulation in these systems, which
relates to third bodies. The orbital periods resulted from 3.6 to 11.3 yr and
the eccentricities were found to be up to 0.64. This is the first time that
this kind of analysis for the set of extragalactic sources has been performed.
The Wolf-Rayet system OGLE-LMC-ECL-08823 is the most mysterious one, owing to
the resultant high mass function. Another system, OGLE-LMC-ECL-19996, was found
to contain a third body with a very high mass (M3,min = 26M0). One system
(OGLE-LMC-ECL-09971) is suspicious because of its eccentricity, and another one
(OGLE-LMC-ECL-20162) shows some light curve variability, with a possible
flare-like or microlensing-like event. Conclusions: All of these results came
only from the photometric observations of the systems and can be considered as
a good starting point for future dedicated observations.

where the goal is to learn the value of some unknown target variable through a
sequence of informative, noisy tests. In contrast to prior work, we focus on
the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be
conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such
assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize
the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly. In this
paper, we propose ECED, a novel, computationally efficient active learning
algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated,
noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each
step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective,
which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on
an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and
utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the near-optimal bound. We
demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances,
including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among
economic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preference
learning task via pairwise comparisons.

  techniques","24 pages, 18 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of critical systems is becoming more and more complex. The
overall tendency is that development costs raise. In order to cut cost of
development, companies are forced to build systems from proven components and
larger new systems from smaller older ones. Respective reuse activities involve
good number of people, tools and processes along different stages of the
development lifecycle which involve large numbers of tools. Some development is
directly planned for reuse. Planned reuse implies excellent knowledge
management and firm governance of reusable items. According to the current
state of the art, there are still practical problems in the two fields, mainly
because the governance and knowledge management is fragmented over the tools of
the toolchain. In our experience, the practical effect of this fragmentation is
that involved ancestor and derivation relationships are often undocumented or
not exploitable. Additionally, useful reuse is almost always dealing with
heterogeneous content which must be transferred from older to newer development
environments. In this process, interoperability proves either as biggest
obstacle or greatest help. In this paper, authors connect the topics
interoperability and knowledge management and propose to seek for ubiquitous
reuse via advanced interoperability features. A single concept from a larger
Technical Interoperability Concept (TIC) with the name bubble is presented.
Bubbles are expected to overcome existing barriers to cost-efficient reuse in
systems and software development lifecycles. That is why, the present paper
introduces and defines bubbles by showing how they simplify application of
repairs and changes and hence contribute to expansion of reuse at reduced cost.

static users are served by both macro and micro base stations, whereas the
mobile (i.e., moving) users are served only by macro base stations having
larger cells; the idea is to prevent frequent data outage for mobile users due
to handoff. We use the classical two-tier Poisson network model with different
transmit powers (cf [1]), assume independent Poisson process of static users
and doubly stochastic Poisson process of mobile users moving at a constant
speed along infinite straight lines generated by a Poisson line process. Using
stochastic geometry, we calculate the average downlink data rate of the typical
static and mobile (i.e., moving) users, the latter accounted for handoff outage
periods. We consider also the average throughput of these two types of users
defined as their average data rates divided by the mean total number of users
co-served by the same base station. We find that if the density of a
homogeneous network and/or the speed of mobile users is high, it is
advantageous to let the mobile users connect only to some optimal fraction of
BSs to reduce the frequency of handoffs during which the connection is not
assured. If a heterogeneous structure of the network is allowed, one can
further jointly optimize the mean throughput of mobile and static users by
appropriately tuning the powers of micro and macro base stations subject to
some aggregate power constraint ensuring unchanged mean data rates of static
users via the network equivalence property (see [2]).

superposition of E2h phonon (wurtzite : WZ) and TO phonon (zinc blende : ZB) of
InAs. Polarized and wavelength dependent SRRS establishes the presence of WZ
and ZB phases in these MNWs. However, formation of WZ phase for larger diameter
InAs MNWs is not commensurate with existing growth mapping studies, which needs
to be understood further. Study of several of these MNWs suggest that the
fraction of WZ to ZB in a MNW is decided not only by diameter, but also by
local growth seeding/conditions leading to either tapered or uniform MNWs
formation, although, external growth conditions are same. Variation of these
frequencies that from bulk value are correlated to residual stress generated in
ZB and WZ phases due to presence of WZ and ZB phases, respectively.
Consistently, temperature dependent Raman data shows that there is a measurable
contribution of stress to dw/dT, a positive for ZB and negative for WZ phonons,
due to difference in their thermal expansions. Further, effective thermal
expansion coefficient of WZ InAs in presence of ZB phase is calculated to vary
in the range 10 - 19 x 10-6/K from base to tip of a MNW at 80 K, which is not

network parameters, and their tightness is assessed in comparison with an
achievable worst-case delay. A noticeable enhancement of the delay bounds, thus
network resource efficiency and scalability, is highlighted under our proposal
with reference to conventional approaches. Finally, the efficiency of the PMOC
approach to provide timing guarantees is confirmed in the case of a realistic

distributed systems for over two decades. Indeed, the search for lower bounds
and impossibility results for this problem spawned the topological approach to
distributed computing, which has given rise to new techniques in the design and
analysis of protocols. The design of efficient solutions to set consensus has
also proven to be challenging. In the synchronous crash failure model, the
literature contains a sequence of solutions to set consensus, each improving
upon the previous ones.
  This paper presents an unbeatable protocol for nonuniform k-set consensus in
the synchronous crash failure model. This is an efficient protocol whose
decision times cannot be improved upon. Moreover, the description of our
protocol is extremely succinct. Proving unbeatability of this protocol is a
nontrivial challenge. We provide two proofs for its unbeatability: one is a
subtle constructive combinatorial proof, and the other is a topological proof
of a new style. These two proofs provide new insight into the connection
between topological reasoning and combinatorial reasoning about protocols,
which has long been a subject of interest. In particular, our topological proof
reasons in a novel way about subcomplexes of the protocol complex, and sheds
light on an open question posed by Guerraoui and Pochon (2009). Finally, using
the machinery developed in the design of this unbeatable protocol, we propose a
protocol for uniform k-set consensus that beats all known solutions by a large
margin.

violated this rule. By using the combined Greenwich Photoheliographic Results
(GPR) and Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot group data during the
period 1874-2015, and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) of sunspot groups
during the period 1974-2015, here we have found that the solar cycle pair (22,

of small sunspot groups in both the northern and the southern hemispheres,
during cycle 22 a large abundance of small sunspot groups in the southern
hemisphere. In the case of large and small sunspot groups the cycle pair (22,
23) violated the G-O rule in the northern and southern hemispheres,
respectively, suggesting the north-south asymmetry in solar activity has a
significant contribution in the violation of G-O rule. The amplitude of solar
cycle 24 is smaller than that of solar cycle 23. However, Coronal Mass
Ejections (CMEs) rate in the rising phases of the cycles 23 and 24 are almost

larger in the rising phase of cycle 24 than that in the corresponding phase of

imply phase coherence on lengthscales of up to 10 $\mu$m and temperature $T$ up

is ubiquitous in industrial applications and as a means to achieve controlled
field-induced assembly of nanoparticles. Yet, applying shear flow to a
charge-stabilized colloidal suspension, which is initially monodisperse and in
quasi-equilibrium leads to non-trivial clustering phenomena (and sometimes to a
gelation transition), dominated by the complex interplay between DLVO
interactions and shear flow. The quantitative understanding of these strongly
nonequilibrium phenomena is still far from being complete. By taking advantage
of a recent shear-induced aggregation rate theory developed in our group, we
present here a systematic numerical study, based on the governing master
kinetic equation (population-balance) for the shear-induced clustering and
breakup of colloids exposed to shear flow. In the presence of sufficiently
stable particles, the clustering kinetics is characterized by an initial very
slow growth, controlled by repulsion. During this regime, particles are slowly
aggregating to form clusters, the reactivity of which increases along with
their size growth. When their size reaches a critical threshold, a very rapid,
explosive-like growth follows, where shear forces are able to overcome the
energy barrier between particles. This stage terminates when a dynamic balance
between shear-induced aggregation and cluster breakage is reached. It is also
observed that these systems are characterized by a cluster mass distribution
that for a long time presents a well-defined bimodality. The model predictions
are quantitatively in excellent agreement with available experimental data,
showing how the theoretical picture is able to quantitatively account for the
underlying nonequilibrum physics.

may develop within sunspots. However, the dependence of this rotation on
sub-photospheric field strength and twist remains largely unknown.
  Aims. We investigate the effects of varying the initial field strength and
twist of an emerging sub-photospheric magnetic flux tube on the rotation of the
sunspots at the photosphere.
  Methods. We consider a simple model of a stratified domain with a
sub-photospheric interior layer and three overlying atmospheric layers. A
twisted arched flux tube is inserted in the interior and is allowed to rise
into the atmosphere. To achieve this, the MHD equations are solved using the
Lagrangian-remap code, Lare3d. We perform a parameter study by independently
varying the sub-photospheric magnetic field strength and twist.
  Results. Altering the initial field strength and twist significantly affects
the tube's evolution and the rotational motions that develop at the
photosphere. The rotation angle, vorticity, and current show a direct
dependence on the initial field strength. We find that an increase in field
strength increases the angle through which the fieldlines rotate, the length of
fieldlines extending into the atmosphere, and the magnetic energy transported
to the atmosphere. This also affects the amount of residual twist in the
interior. The length of the fieldlines is crucial as we predict the twist per
unit length equilibrates to a lower value on longer fieldlines. No such direct
dependence is found when we modify the twist owing to the complex effect this
has on the tension force acting on the tube. However, there is still a clear
ordering in quantities such as the rotation angle, helicity, and free energy
with higher initial twist cases being related to sunspots that rotate more
rapidly, transporting more helicity and magnetic energy to the atmosphere.

with a stellar binary model involving mass transfer that leads to the launching
of jets. We inspect observations of the ILOT M31LRN 2015 and conclude that it
cannot be explained by the onset of a common envelope evolution (CEE). Instead
we conjecture that a $M \simeq 1 - 3 ~\rm{M_\odot}$ main sequence star accreted
$\simeq 0.04 ~\rm{M_\odot}$ from the giant star, possibly during a periastron
passage. The main sequence star accreted mass through an accretion disc, that
launches jets. The radiation from the disk and the collision of the jets with
the ambient gas can account for the luminosity of the event. Along similar
lines, we suggest that the 2013 eruption of SN 2015bh (SNHunt~275) can also be
explained by the High-Accretion-Powered ILOT (HAPI) model. In this case a
massive secondary star $M_2 \gtrsim 10 ~\rm{M_\odot}$ accreted $\approx 0.05
~\rm{M_\odot}$ from a much more massive and more evolved star during a
periastron passage. If the much more energetic 2015 outburst of SN 2015bh

head-on merger event, or else can be accounted for by a the HAPI-jets model in

quantifies the segregation and integration of information between cortical
areas. Due to mathematical complexity, a theory that could explain how the
parameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the
functional connectivity is still to be formulated. Yet, many interesting
problems in neuroscience involve the study of networks composed of a small
number of neurons. Based on a recent study of the dynamics of small neural
circuits, we combine the analysis of local bifurcations of multi-population
neural networks of arbitrary size with the analytical calculation of the
functional connectivity. We study the functional connectivity in different
regimes, showing that external stimuli cause the network to switch from
asynchronous states characterized by weak correlation and low variability
(local chaos), to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and
wide temporal fluctuations (critical slowing down). Local chaos typically
occurs in large networks, but here we show that it can also be generated by
strong stimuli in small neural circuits. On the other side, critical slowing
down is expected to occur when the stimulus moves the network close to a local
bifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the
saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly
negative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous
symmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations. These results prove that
the functional connectivity of firing-rate network models is strongly affected
by the external stimuli even if the anatomical connections are fixed, and
suggest an effective mechanism through which biological networks can
dynamically modulate the encoding and integration of sensory information.

The calculation results predict that about sixty unknown neutron-rich isotopes

cross sections above the lower bound of $10^{-8}$ mb in this reaction. And
almost all of unknown neutron-rich isotopes are emitted at the laboratory

collision time between two uranium nuclei is shorter and the primary fragments
producing the residues have smaller excitation energies of $\leq$ 30 MeV and
the outgoing angles of those residues cover a range of 30$^\circ$-60$^\circ$.
For the later case, the longer collision time is needed for a large number of

energies and smaller outgoing angles of primary fragments, and eventually
results in a very small production cross section for the residues of Rf with

where two senders can jointly and remotely prepare a quantum state. One sender
has the information regarding amplitude, while the other one has the phase
information of a quantum state to be jointly prepared at the receiver's port.
However, there exists a hierarchy among the receivers, as far as powers to
reconstruct the quantum state is concerned. A 5-qubit cluster state has been
used here to perform the task. Further, it is established that the proposed
scheme for hierarchical JRSP (HJRSP) is of enormous practical importance in
critical situations involving defense and other sectors, where it is essential
to ensure that an important decision/order that can severely affect a society
or an organization is not taken by a single person, and once the order is
issued all the receivers don't possess an equal right to implement it. Further,
the effect of different noise models (e.g., amplitude damping (AD), phase
damping (PD), collective noise and Pauli noise models) on the HJRSP protocol
proposed here is investigated. It is found that in AD and PD noise models a
higher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state to be remotely prepared
with higher fidelity than that done by the lower power agent(s). In contrast,
the opposite may happen in the presence of collective noise models. We have
also proposed a scheme for probabilistic HJRSP using a non-maximally entangled
5-qubit cluster state.

experimental procedures which should cause gaseous nanobubbles to completely
dissolve. In our experiments we nucleated nanobubble-like objects by putting a
drop of water on HOPG using a plastic syringe and disposable needle. In method
A, the nanobubble-like objects were exposed to a flow of degassed water (1.17
mg/l) for 96 hours. In method B, the ambient pressure was lowered in order to
degas the liquid and the nanobubble-like objects. Interestingly, the
nanobubble-like objects remained stable after exposure to both methods. After
thorough investigation of the procedures and materials used during our
experiments, we found that the nanobubble-like object were induced by the use
of disposable needles in which PDMS contaminated the water. It is very
important for the nanobubble community to be aware of the fact that, although
features look and behave like nanobubbles, in some cases they might in fact be
or induced by contamination. The presence of contamination could also resolve
some inconsistencies found in the nanobubble literature.

about 75 mW and a repetition rate of 3 kHz, and at a wavelength of 1064 nm. Due
to its rather small diameter of only 80 {\mu}{\mu}m, the receiver detector
features a low noise rate of less than 2 kHz and can be operated without gating

several orbital objects equipped with retroreflectors. In its current

filaments and prestellar cores represent two fundamental steps in the star
formation process. The observations support a picture of low-mass star
formation according to which ~ 0.1 pc-wide filaments form first in the cold
interstellar medium, probably as a result of large-scale compression of
interstellar matter by supersonic turbulent flows, and then prestellar cores
arise from gravitational fragmentation of the densest filaments. Whether this
scenario also applies to regions of high-mass star formation is an open
question, in part because Herschel data cannot resolve the inner width of
filaments in the nearest regions of massive star formation.
  We used the bolometer camera ArTeMiS on the APEX telescope to map the central
part of the NGC6334 complex at a factor of > 3 higher resolution than Herschel
at 350 microns. Combining ArTeMiS data with Herschel data allowed us to study
the structure of the main filament of the complex with a resolution of 8"" or <
0.07 pc at d ~ 1.7 kpc.
  Our study confirms that this filament is a very dense, massive linear
structure with a line mass ranging from ~ 500 Msun/pc to ~ 2000 Msun/pc over
nearly 10 pc. It also demonstrates that its inner width remains as narrow as W
~ 0.15 +- 0.05 pc all along the filament length, within a factor of < 2 of the
characteristic 0.1 pc value found with Herschel for lower-mass filaments in the
Gould Belt. While it is not completely clear whether the NGC 6334 filament will
form massive stars or not in the future, it is two to three orders of magnitude
denser than the majority of filaments observed in Gould Belt clouds, and yet
has a very similar inner width. This points to a common physical mechanism for
setting the filament width and suggests that some important structural
properties of nearby clouds also hold in high-mass star forming regions.

environmental variables. These variables often exhibit spatial correlation,
which has to be accounted for in the calibration models used in predictions,
either by direct modelling of the dependencies or by allowing for spatially
correlated stochastic effects. Another feature in many remote sensing
instruments is that the derived predictor variables are highly correlated,
which can lead to unnecessary model over-training and at worst, singularities
in the estimates. Both of these affect the prediction accuracy, especially when
the training set for model calibration is small. To overcome these modelling
challenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely
sensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory.
We use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the
predictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a
spatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not
explained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo
sampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model
parameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it
outperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were
spatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.

of generators of the set of lattice points and (ii) counting elements
degree-wise in a generating function, the Hilbert Series. In the homogeneous
case, in which the polyhedron is a cone, the set of generators is the Hilbert
basis of the intersection of the cone and the lattice, an affine monoid.
  We will present some improvements to the Normaliz algorithm by subdividing
simplicial cones with huge volumes. In the first approach the subdivision
points are found by integer programming techniques. For this purpose we
interface to the integer programming solver SCIP to our software. In the second

triangulation/quadrilateralization of the domain produces many interior edges

without going to triangulation/quadrilateralization? There are three major
difficulties with this type of approach that are addressed: 1- How can a convex
hull tessellation be obtained for complex geometries encountered in practical
engineering applications? 2- How can basis functions and quadrature points be
defined on these hulls? 3- How can this type of grid and corresponding basis
functions be used in practice to yield accurate discretization of nonlinear
conservation laws? Geometrical approaches to tackle the first challenge are
discussed . To solve the second challenge, for the first time in the
literature, a closed form relation is proposed to approximate Fekete points (a
Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP) problem) on a general convex/concave
polyhedral. The approximate points are used to generate basis functions using
the SVD of the Vandermonde matrix. The type of basis functions derived include
Lagrange basis, orthogonal and orthonormal hull basis and radial basis. It is
shown that the hull basis is the best choice to enforce minimum DOF while
maintaining a small Lebesgue constant when very high p-refinement is done. The
proposed hull basis is rigorously proven to achieve arbitrary order of accuracy
by satisfying Weierstrass approximation theorem in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The third
challenge is met using a standard Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Discontinuous
Least-Squares (DLS) spectral hull formulations. The accuracy and stability of
the formulation is demonstrated for the linearized acoustics and
two-dimensional compressible Euler equations on some benchmark problems

Specifically, for the case in which there are $M_f^{(k)}$ frequent $k$-itemsets

and is controlled by a gravitational constant $\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$, which
replaces Newton's $G$. With the new dynamics, the various detailed
manifestations of the anomalies in galaxies are predicted with no need for dark
matter. The cosmological anomalies could, but need not have to do with small
accelerations. For example, the need for dark matter in accounting for the
expansion history of the Universe is eliminated if the relevant gravitational
constant is $\approx 2\pi G$. Such a `renormalization' of $G$ could be a
dimensionless parameter of a MOND theory. The constant $a_0$ turns out to carry
cosmological connotations, in that $2\pi a_0\approx cH_0\approx
c^2(\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$, where $H_0$ is the present expansion rate of the
Universe, and $\Lambda$ the measured `cosmological constant'. There are MOND
theories in which this `coincidence' is natural. I draw on enlightening
historical and conceptual analogies from quantum theory to limelight aspects of
MOND. I also explain how MOND may have strong connections with effects of the
quantum vacuum on local dynamics.

solar telescope on 2014 July 18. High-resolution time-series of blue continuum
and G-band images acquired in the blue imaging channel (BIC) of the GREGOR
Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer (GFPI) were complemented by LOS magnetograms and
continuum images obtained with the HMI onboard the SDO. Horizontal proper
motions and horizontal plasma velocities were computed with local correlation
tracking (LCT) and the differential affine velocity estimator, respectively.
Morphological image processing was employed to measure the photometric/magnetic
area, magnetic flux, and the separation profile of the EFR during its
evolution. Results. The computed growth rates for photometric area, magnetic
area, and magnetic flux are about twice as high as the respective decay rates.
The space-time diagram using HMI magnetograms of five days traces a leaf-like
structure, which is determined by the initial separation of the two polarities,
a rapid expansion phase, a time when the spread stalls, and a period when the
region slowly shrinks again. The separation rate of 0.26 km\s is highest in the
initial stage, and it decreases when the separation comes to a halt. Horizontal
plasma velocities computed at four evolutionary stages indicate a changing
pattern of inflows. In LCT maps we find persistent flow patterns such as
outward motions in the outer part of the two major pores, a diverging feature
near the trailing pore marking the site of upwelling plasma and flux emergence,
and low velocities in the interior of pores. We detected many elongated rapidly
expanding granules between the two major polarities.

mediated interaction compared to the slow propagation case. We show that the
process is characterized by two time scales. At short storage times, we observe
a strong enhancement of the interaction due to the reduction of the Rydberg
polariton group velocity down to zero. For longer storage times, we observe a
further, weaker enhancement dominated by Rydberg induced dephasing of the
multiparticle components of the state. In this regime, we observe a non-linear
dependence of the Rydberg polariton coherence time with the input photon
number. Our results have direct consequences in Rydberg quantum optics and
enable the test of new theories of strongly interacting Rydberg systems.

allowing for the maintenance of biodiversity remain obscure. The competitive
exclusion principle and May's complexity-diversity puzzle both suggest that a
community can support only a small number of species, turning the spotlight at
the dynamics of local patches or islands, where stable and uninvadable (SU)
subsets of species play a crucial role. Here we map the community SUs question
to the geometric problem of finding maximal cliques of the corresponding graph.
We solve for the number of SUs as a function of the species richness in the
regional pool, $N$, showing that this growth is subexponential, contrary to
long-standing wisdom. We show that symmetric systems relax rapidly to an SU,
where the system stays until a regime shift takes place. In asymmetric systems
the relaxation time grows much faster with $N$, suggesting an excitable

MU-MIMO systems in which the base station (BS) endowed with $M$ antennas
communicates with $K$ single-antenna user equipments (UEs). Particularly, we
aim at reducing the complexity of the linear precoder and receiver that
maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio subject to a given
power constraint. To this end, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $M$
and $K$ grow large with a given ratio. Tools from random matrix theory (RMT)
are then used to compute, in closed form, accurate approximations for the
parameters of the optimal precoder and receiver, when imperfect channel state
information (modeled by the generic Gauss-Markov formulation form) is available
at the BS. The asymptotic analysis allows us to derive the asymptotically
optimal linear precoder and receiver that are characterized by a lower
complexity (due to the dependence on the large scale components of the channel)
and, possibly, by a better resilience to imperfect channel state information.
However, the implementation of both is still challenging as it requires fast
inversions of large matrices in every coherence period. To overcome this issue,
we apply the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE) technique to the precoding
and receiving vector of each UE and make use of RMT to determine the optimal
weighting coefficients on a per-UE basis that asymptotically solve the max-min
SINR problem. Numerical results are used to validate the asymptotic analysis in
the finite system regime and to show that the proposed TPE transceivers
efficiently mimic the optimal ones, while requiring much lower computational
complexity.

depends on the distance from satellite foot point and assumed production
altitude. As the absorption of the TGF photons increases significantly with
lower source altitude and larger distance between the source and the observing
satellite, these might be important factors. We have addressed the issue by
using the tropopause pressure distribution as an approximation of the TGF

spheric measurements to determine the distance. The study is made possible by
the increased number of Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)

TGF/lightning ratio for the tropics probably has an annual variability due to
an annual variability in the Dobson-Brewer circulation. The main result is an
indication that the altitude distribution and distance should be considered
when investigating the source fluence distribution of TGFs, as this leads to a

both genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors.
Evaluating the contribution of environment to gene expression regulation and
identifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental
factors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize
that by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes
that may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air
pollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived
from unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan,
Nigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us
to characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression
levels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show
much smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false
discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family
members in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a
random-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more
likely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in
couples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those
genes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the
relationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that
transcriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common

cells of skeletal muscles in order to provide a movement. The non-invasive
prosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an

the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to
decide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a
significant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and
performed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the
traditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An
actual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for
an amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms
that exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer
to prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our
case an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis,
could use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform
those movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational
investigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in
order to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control.
Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the
previous knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee.
Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects
already trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of
about an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learn
to use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploits
previous experience of amputees or intact.

estimate of the total $^{15}$N(n,$\gamma$)$^{16}$N cross section from Coulomb
dissociation of $^{16}$N requires a precise knowledge of the $\gamma$-ray

Shubhchintak, and Chatterjee predicts a strongly energy-dependent ground state
branching of the order of 0.05\% to 0.6\% at energies between 100 and 500 keV
which is almost 2 orders of magnitude below calculations in the direct capture
model. Additionally, this calculation of Neelam, Shubhchintak, and Chatterjee

  at 135.5 keV","5 pages, 3 figures; Phys. Rev. C, accepted for publication",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.93.065804",,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Because of its half-life of about 35 million years, 92Nb is
considered as a chronometer for nucleosynthesis events prior to the birth of
our sun. The abundance of 92Nb in the early solar system can be derived from
meteoritic data. It has to be compared to theoretical estimates for the
production of 92Nb to determine the time between the last nucleosynthesis event
before the formation of the early solar system.
  Purpose: The influence of a low-lying short-lived isomer on the
nucleosynthesis of 92Nb is analyzed. The thermal coupling between the ground
state and the isomer via so-called intermediate states affects the production
and survival of 92Nb.
  Method: The properties of the lowest intermediate state in 92Nb are known
from experiment. From the lifetime of the intermediate state and from its decay
branchings, the transition rate from the ground state to the isomer and the
effective half-life of 92Nb are calculated as a function of the temperature.
  Results: The coupling between the ground state and the isomer is strong. This
leads to thermalization of ground state and isomer in the nucleosynthesis of
92Nb in any explosive production scenario and almost 100% survival of 92Nb in
its ground state. However, the strong coupling leads to a temperature-dependent
effective half-life of 92Nb which makes the 92Nb survival very sensitive to
temperatures as low as about 8 keV, thus turning 92Nb at least partly into a
thermometer.
  Conclusions: The low-lying isomer in 92Nb does not affect the production of
92Nb in explosive scenarios. In retrospect this validates all previous studies
where the isomer was not taken into account. However, the dramatic reduction of
the effective half-life at temperatures below 10 keV may affect the survival of
92Nb after its synthesis in supernovae which are the most likely astrophysical
site for the nucleosynthesis of 92Nb.

of individual GaN/AlN Quantum Disks (QDisks) embedded into GaN nanowires (NW).
The structural and optical properties of the QDisks were probed by high spatial
resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) in a scanning transmission electron
microscope (STEM). By exciting the QDisks with a nanometric electron beam at
currents spanning over 3 orders of magnitude, strong non-linearities (energy
shifts) in the light emission are observed. In particular, we find that the
amount of energy shift depends on the emission rate and on the QDisk morphology
(size, position along the NW and shell thickness). For thick QDisks (>4nm), the
QDisk emission energy is observed to blue-shift with the increase of the
emission intensity. This is interpreted as a consequence of the increase of
carriers density excited by the incident electron beam inside the QDisks, which
screens the internal electric field and thus reduces the quantum confined Stark
effect (QCSE) present in these QDisks. For thinner QDisks (<3 nm), the
blue-shift is almost absent in agreement with the negligible QCSE at such
sizes. For QDisks of intermediate sizes there exists a current threshold above
which the energy shifts, marking the transition from unscreened to partially
screened QCSE. From the threshold value we estimate the lifetime in the
unscreened regime. These observations suggest that, counterintuitively,
electrons of high energy can behave ultimately as single electron-hole pair
generators. In addition, when we increase the current from 1 pA to 10 pA the
light emission efficiency drops by more than one order of magnitude. This
reduction of the emission efficiency is a manifestation of the efficiency droop
as observed in nitride-based 2D light emitting diodes, a phenomenon tentatively
attributed to the Auger effect.

machine learning to estimate the parameters in the generalised linear models.
In particular, IRLS for L1 minimisation under the linear model provides a
closed-form solution in each step, which is a simple multiplication between the
inverse of the weighted second moment matrix and the weighted first moment
vector. When dealing with privacy sensitive data, however, developing a privacy
preserving IRLS algorithm faces two challenges. First, due to the inversion of
the second moment matrix, the usual sensitivity analysis in differential
privacy incorporating a single datapoint perturbation gets complicated and
often requires unrealistic assumptions. Second, due to its iterative nature, a
significant cumulative privacy loss occurs. However, adding a high level of
noise to compensate for the privacy loss hinders from getting accurate
estimates. Here, we develop a practical algorithm that overcomes these
challenges and outputs privatised and accurate IRLS solutions. In our method,
we analyse the sensitivity of each moments separately and treat the matrix
inversion and multiplication as a post-processing step, which simplifies the
sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we apply the {\it{concentrated differential
privacy}} formalism, a more relaxed version of differential privacy, which
requires adding a significantly less amount of noise for the same level of
privacy guarantee, compared to the conventional and advanced compositions of
differentially private mechanisms.

higher radio frequencies up to 43 GHz has been confirmed. The non-detection at
100 GHz was not so strong constraint, and therefore the spectral behavior above
43 GHz remains unclear. The astrometric position of the high-frequency excess

low-frequency radio position to an accuracy of 0.1 arcsec, corresponding to ~80

place two-point spectral index limits of \alpha_{20cm}^{4cm} < 5.8 and
\alpha_{90cm}^{20cm} > -7.6, where fluence F \propto f^\alpha if we assume true
the burst rate reported by Champion et al. (2016) of R(F~0.6 Jy ms) = 7 x 10^3
sky^{-1} day^{-1} (for bursts of ~3 ms duration). This upper limit on \alpha
suggests that if FRBs are extragalactic but non-cosmological, that on average
they are not experiencing excessive free-free absorption due to a medium with
high optical depth (assuming temperature ~8,000 K), which excessively invert
their low-frequency spectrum. This in turn implies that the dispersion of FRBs
arises in either or both of the intergalactic medium or the host galaxy, rather
than from the source itself.

the ability that not only differentiates the three pulses on the whole but also
tells the details of each pulse.In the measurements, beam energy is converted
by a target to the Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) light, the information
carried by which provides a good approach to measure beam profile and
divergence simultaneously. Combining with this characteristic of OTR light, the
concept of dual-imaging method is adopted in the design of optical imaging
system. To avoid interference of the system optical parameters with one
another, the original system is separated into two parts by functions, one for
beam profile measurements and the other for divergence measurements.
Correspondingly a splitter is interposed immediately after the OTR target which
splits the light into two parts in perpendicular directions, one part forming a
beam spot, and the remaining becoming polarized through a polarizer and imaged
by an OTR lens and forming a beam divergence pattern. Again the use of
splitters helps the light beam enter different framing camera for different
use.With a time resolution of 2ns, the system can provide 8 frames of beam
details within any one of the three pulses,at the same time as acquiring the
quality of the three pulses on the whole.

are often studied by time-consuming computer codes. These codes are analyzed
with statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the
physical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality
constraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a
model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality
constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional
decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a
finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations
satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum
a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the
conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of
the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints
such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1.
Introduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be
expensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate
for conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design
points). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices
[23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty
quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties.
For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality
constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such
as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to
partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also
GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a
GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the
resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation
with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is
deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the
inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16],
[24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP
by using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that
case, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input
locations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty
quantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have
been based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input
locations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data,
a Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP
emulator by using the prior monotonicity
