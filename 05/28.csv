correlations between various combinations of HI, CIII, CIV, SiIII, SiIV, and
OVI. We find good agreement between many of the simulated and observed
correlations, including OVI(HI). However, the observed median optical depths
for the CIV(HI) and SiIV(HI) relations are higher than those measured from the
mock spectra. The discrepancy increases from up to $\approx0.1$ dex at
$\tau_{\rm HI}=1$ to $\approx1$ dex at $\tau_{\rm HI}=10^2$, where we are
likely probing dense regions at small galactocentric distances. As possible
solutions, we invoke (a) models of ionizing radiation softened above 4 Ryd to
account for delayed completion of HeII reionization; (b) simulations run at a
higher resolution; (c) the inclusion of additional line broadening due to
unresolved turbulence; and (d) increased elemental abundancess; however, none
of these factors can fully explain the observed differences. Enhanced
photoionization of HI by local sources, which was not modelled, could offer a
solution. However, the much better agreement with the observed OVI(HI)
relation, which we find probes a hot and likely collisionally-ionized gas
phase, indicates that the simulations are not in tension with the hot phase of
the IGM, and suggests that the simulated outflows may entrain insufficient cool

robustness metrics that can be calculated while disconnections appear. Our
research question is: if a smart adversary has a limited number of strikes to
attack the Internet, how much will the damage be after each one in terms of

catastrophes, but also to a backlog of environmental challenges. We model
long-term evolution to long series of small challenges, where fitter
populations reach higher population sizes. The population's long-term fitness
dynamic is well approximated by a simple stochastic Markov chain model.
Long-term persistence occurs when the rate of adaptation exceeds the rate of
environmental deterioration for some genotypes. Long-term persistence times are
consistent with typical fossil species persistence times of several million
years. Immediately preceding extinction, fitness declines rapidly, appearing as
though a catastrophe disrupted a stably established population, even though
gradual evolutionary processes are responsible. New populations go through an
establishment phase where, despite being demographically viable, their
extinction risk is elevated. Should the population survive long enough,
extinction risk later becomes constant over time.

and its role on the pairing mechanism attract increasing attention. To archive
deep understanding on these issues, we perform the
functional-renormalization-group (fRG) study for the two-orbital Hubbard model.
The vertex corrections for the electron-boson coupling ($U$-VC), which are
dropped in the Migdal-Eliashberg gap equation, are obtained by solving the RG
equation. We reveal that the dressed electron-boson coupling for the
charge-channel, $U_{eff}^c$, becomes much larger than the bare Coulomb
interaction, $U^0$, due to the $U$-VC in the presence of moderate spin
fluctuations. For this reason, the attractive pairing interaction due to the
charge or orbital fluctuations is enlarged by the factor $(U_{eff}^c/U^0)^2 >>
1$. In contrast, the spin fluctuation pairing interaction is suppressed by the
spin-channel $U$-VC, because of the relation $U_{eff}^s << U^0$. The present
study demonstrates that the orbital or charge fluctuation pairing mechanism can
be realized in various multiorbital systems thanks to the $U$-VC, such as in
Fe-based superconductors.

developed in several ways. Multipliers are expressions whose (summed) product
with a PDE (system) yields a local divergence identity which has the physical
meaning of a continuity equation involving a conserved density and a spatial
flux for solutions of the PDE (system). On spatial domains, the integral form
of a continuity equation yields a conserved integral. When a PDE (system) is
variational, multipliers correspond to symmetries of the variational principle,
and the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a conserved integral
is the same as the variational identity used in Noether's theorem for
connecting conserved integrals to invariance of a variational principle. From
this viewpoint, the multiplier method is shown to constitute a modern form of
Noether's theorem in which the variational principle is not used. When a PDE
(system) is non-variational, multipliers are shown to be an adjoint counterpart
to symmetries, and the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a
conserved integral is shown to be an adjoint generalization of the variational
identity underling Noether's theorem. Two main results are established for PDE
systems having a solved-form for leading derivatives, which encompasses all
typical PDEs of physical interest. First, all non-trivial conserved integrals
are shown to arise from non-trivial multipliers in a one-to-one manner, taking
into account certain equivalence freedoms. Second, a scaling formula based on
dimensional analysis is derived to obtain the conserved density and spatial
flux in any conserved integral, just using the corresponding multiplier and the
given PDE system. The derivations use a few basic tools from variational
calculus, for which a self-contained formulation is provided.

minimization problem which does not require constructing finite elements or
locally supported basis functions. Thus, it allows an easier implementation of
piecewise polynomial representations of various degrees and various smoothness
over an arbitrary triangulation. Moreover, the constrained minimization problem
is converted into an unconstrained minimization via a QR decomposition of the
smoothness constraints, which allows for the development of a fast and
efficient penalized least squares algorithm to fit the model. The estimators of
the parameters are proved to be asymptotically normal under some regularity
conditions. The estimator of the bivariate function is consistent, and its rate
of convergence is also established. The proposed method enables us to construct
confidence intervals and permits inference for the parameters. The performance
of the estimators is evaluated by two simulation examples and by a real data
analysis.

environments through its four active intramolecular vibrational modes (T1u)
near 18.9, 17.4, 8.5, and 7.0 microns. The strengths of the mid-infrared
emission bands have been used to infer astrophysical conditions in the
fullerene-rich regions. Widely varying values of the relative intrinsic
strengths (RIS) of these four bands are reported in laboratory and theoretical
papers, which impedes the derivation of the excitation mechanism of C60 in the
astrophysical sources. The spectroscopic analysis of the C60 samples produced
with our method delivers highly reproducible RIS values of 100, 25 +- 1, 26 +-
1, and 40 +- 4. A comparison of the inferred C60 emission band strengths with
the astrophysical data shows that the observed strengths cannot be explained in
terms of fluorescent or thermal emission alone. The large range in the observed
17.4/18.9 emission ratios indicates that either the emission bands contain
significant contributions from emitters other than C60, or that the population
distribution among the C60 vibrational modes is affected by physical processes
other than thermal or UV excitation, such as chemo-luminescence from nascent
C60 or possibly, Poincare fluorescence resulting from an inverse internal

alternative, we propose a shallow trap SCLC model with selfheating effect based
thermal runaway to explain the sharp current rise followed by a series

shallow trap SCLC ($\alpha \approx 2$), (iii) current shoot up ($\alpha \gg 2$)

thermal modeling are able to match the experimental IV characteristics in all
the regimes. Thus, a current conduction mechanism in PCMO-based RRAM supported

the continuum that is proved using vector calculus can be proven in an
analogous way for the discretized system. We require that the discretizations
be second order accurate and have a conserved quantity that approximates the
energy for the system and guarantees stability for a reasonable constraint on
the time step. We also require that the discretization is time explicit so as
to avoid the solution of large system of possibly nonlinear algebraic
equations. The well known Yee grid discretization of Maxwell's equations is the
same as our discretization and is an early example of using a staggered space
and time grid .
  To motivate our discussion we begin by studying the staggered time or
leapfrog discretization of the harmonic oscillator and use this to introduce
the modification of the energy that is conserved. Next we use systems of linear
equations to motivate the definition of the modified energy for more complex
systems of ordinary differential equations and then apply our ideas to the
scalar wave equation in one spatial dimension. We finish by discretizing the
three dimensional scalar wave and Maxwell's equations. Because the spatial
discretization is mimetic, we obtain that the divergence of the electric and

properties the proof of this trivial and is essentially the same as in the

the Tracy-Widom fluctuations of the second largest eigenvalue for $p\gg

cosmic strings. One of the strongest sources of gravitational waves is
discontinuities of cosmic strings, called kinks, which are generated at points
of intersection. Kinks on infinite strings are known to generate a
gravitational wave background over a wide range of frequencies. In this paper,
we calculate the spectrum of the gravitational wave background by numerically
solving the evolution equation for the distribution function of the kink
sharpness. We find that the number of kinks for small sharpness is larger than
the analytical estimate used in a previous work, which makes a difference in
the spectral shape. Our numerical approach also helps to avoid the use of
analytic approximations, and enables us to make a more precise prediction on
the spectral amplitude for future gravitational wave experiments.

$\lambda\sim20$. The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of

two integrated Compton-$y$ $Y_\textrm{500}$-$\lambda$ relations for the
DES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting for
the SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with $\lambda > 80$,
the two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements,
while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a
factor of $0.61 \pm 0.12$ compared to the prediction. For clusters at $20 <
\lambda < 80$, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of
$\sim$0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 and 10~$\sigma$ significance) compared to the

corrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependent
bias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of the

larger offsets in the SZE-optical centering or larger scatter in the

(AGN) feedback, and showing a strong preference for giant elliptical host
galaxies, radio AGN (L_1.4GHz > 10^24 W Hz^-1) are a key sub-class of the
overall AGN population. Here I review our current state of understanding of the
population of radio AGN at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 0.7),
concentrating on their AGN and host galaxy properties, and covering three
interlocking themes: the classification of radio AGN and its interpretation;
the triggering and fuelling of the jet and AGN activity; and the evolution of
the host galaxies. I show that much of the observed diversity in the AGN
properties of radio AGN can be explained in terms of a combination of
orientation/anisotropy, mass accretion rate, and variability effects. The
detailed morphologies of the host galaxies are consistent with the triggering
of strong-line radio galaxies (SLRG) in galaxy mergers. However, the star
formation properties and cool ISM contents suggest that the triggering mergers
are relatively minor in terms of their gas masses in most cases, and would not
lead to major growth of the supermassive black holes and stellar bulges;
therefore, apart from a minority (<20%) that show evidence for higher star
formation rates and more massive cool ISM reservoirs, the SLRG represent
late-time re-triggering of activity in mature giant elliptical galaxies. In
contrast, the host and environmental properties of weak-line radio galaxies
(WLRG) with Fanaroff-Riley class I (FRI) radio morphologies are consistent with
more gradual fuelling of the activity via gas accretion at low rates onto the
supermassive black holes.

an X-ray, proper motion and color-magnitude selected sample, we obtained
spectra for 361 stars, for which we report spectral classifications and Li and

recovered 51 previously published members. We have combined these with
previously known members to form a sample of 493 solar-mass (~0.7-1.3 Msun)
members of Sco-Cen. We investigated the star-formation history of this sample,
and re-assessed the ages of the massive main-sequence turn-off and the G-type
members in all three subgroups. We performed a census for circumstellar disks
in our sample using WISE infrared data and find a protoplanetary disk fraction
for K-type stars of 4.4$^{+1.6}_{-0.9}$% for Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower
Centaurus-Crux at ~16 Myr and 9.0$^{+4.0}_{-2.2}$% for Upper Scorpius at ~10
Myr. These data are consistent with a protoplanetary disk e-folding timescale
of ~4-5 Myr for ~1 Msun stars, twice that previously quoted (Mamajek 2009), but
consistent with the Bell et al. revised age scale of young clusters. Finally,
we construct an age map of Scorpius-Centaurus which clearly reveals
substructure consisting of concentrations of younger and older stars. We find
evidence for strong age gradients within all three subgroups. None of the
subgroups are consistent with being simple, coeval populations which formed in
single bursts, but likely represents a multitude of smaller star formation

communication that transform any two-party interactive protocol into a protocol
that is robust to noise.
  Recently, Haeupler (FOCS '14) showed that if an $\epsilon > 0$ fraction of
transmissions are corrupted, adversarially or randomly, then it is possible to
achieve a communication rate of $1 - \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$.
Furthermore, Haeupler conjectured that this rate is optimal for general input
protocols. This stands in contrast to the classical setting of one-way
communication in which error-correcting codes are known to achieve an optimal
communication rate of $1 - \Theta(H(\epsilon)) = 1 -
\widetilde{\Theta}(\epsilon)$.
  In this work, we show that the quadratically smaller rate loss of the one-way
setting can also be achieved in interactive coding schemes for a very natural
class of input protocols. We introduce the notion of average message length, or
the average number of bits a party sends before receiving a reply, as a natural
parameter for measuring the level of interactivity in a protocol. Moreover, we
show that any protocol with average message length $\ell =
\Omega(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ can be simulated by a protocol with optimal
communication rate $1 - \Theta(H(\epsilon))$ over an oblivious adversarial
channel with error fraction $\epsilon$. Furthermore, under the additional
assumption of access to public shared randomness, the optimal communication
rate is achieved ratelessly, i.e., the communication rate adapts automatically
to the actual error rate $\epsilon$ without having to specify it in advance.
  This shows that the capacity gap between one-way and interactive
communication can be bridged even for very small (constant in $\epsilon$)
average message lengths, which are likely to be found in many applications.

isotropically hardening elastic-viscoplastic solids so that both material
strain rate sensitivity and material inertia are accounted for. The focus is on
the effect of bar size on whether the notch triggers necking or necking
initiates away from the notch. The governing equations are presented in
non-dimensional form and two key non-dimensional groups that involve both
material and loading parameters are identified. For both non-dimensional
groups, with all parameters fixed except for bar size, it is found that for
sufficiently small bars, the notch triggers necking, whereas for sufficiently
large bars necking ultimately occurs away from the notch. With material
properties fixed, for one non-dimensional group the transition to necking away
from the notch corresponds to increasing imposed velocity whereas for the other
non- dimensional group this transition takes place for decreasing imposed
strain rate. Both these transitions correspond to increasing bar size. The
results indicate that this transition is governed by material inertia but the
bar size at which it occurs depends on the material properties, particularly
strain hardening and strain rate hardening.

thousands of times larger, comprises countless libraries, layers, and services,

paper briefly describes methods for efficient, detailed software monitoring, as
well as methods for learning detailed software statistics while providing
differential privacy for its users, and, finally, how machine learning methods
can help discover users' expectations for intended software behavior, and
thereby help set security policy. Those methods can be adopted in practice,

problem in genomics and biomedicine. While detection (testing) of eQTL
associations has been widely studied, less work has been devoted to the
estimation of eQTL effect size. To reduce false positives, detection methods
frequently rely on linear modeling of rank-based normalized or log-transformed
gene expression data. Unfortunately, these approaches do not correspond to the
simplest model of eQTL action, and thus yield estimates of eQTL association
that can be uninterpretable and inaccurate. In this paper we propose a new,
log-of-linear model for eQTL action, termed ACME, that captures allelic
contributions to cis-acting eQTLs in an additive fashion, yielding effect size
estimates that correspond to a biologically coherent model of cis-eQTLs. We
describe a non-linear least-squares algorithm to fit the model by maximum
likelihood, and obtain corresponding $p$-values. We perform careful
investigation of the model using a combination of simulated data and data from
the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our results reveal little
evidence for dominance effects, a parsimonious result that accords with a
simple biological model for allele-specific expression and supports use of the
ACME model. We show that Type-I error is well-controlled under our approach in
a realistic setting, so that rank-based normalizations are unnecessary.
Furthermore, we show that such normalizations can be detrimental to power and
estimation accuracy under the proposed model. We then provide summaries of ACME
effect sizes for whole-genome cis-eQTLs in the GTEx data.

star-forming region of Carina, the most distant, massive cluster in which disks
have been imaged. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array
(ALMA), disks are observed around two young stellar objects (YSOs) that are
embedded inside evaporating gaseous globules and exhibit jet activity. The
disks have an average size of 120 AU and total masses of 30 and 50 M_Jup. Given
the measured masses, the minimum timescale required for planet formation (~1-2
Myr) and the average age of the Carina population (~1-4 Myr), it is plausible
that young planets are present or their formation is currently ongoing in these
disks. The non-detection of millimeter emission above the 4sigma threshold (~7
M_Jup) in the core of the massive cluster Trumpler~14, an area containing
previously identified proplyd candidates, suggest evidence for rapid
photo-evaporative disk destruction in the cluster's harsh radiation field. This
would prevent the formation of giant gas planets in disks located in the cores
of Carina's dense sub-clusters, whereas the majority of YSO disks in the wider
Carina region remain unaffected by external photo-evaporation.

one of the key questions raised by the characterization of transiting
exoplanets over the last decade. There have been claims that many hot Jupiter's
exhibit vertical profiles with increasing temperature with decreasing pressure
in the infrared photosphere that leads to the reversal of molecular absorption
bands into emission features (an inversion). However, these claims have been
based on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identification of
emission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause
the thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have
not been identified despite extensive theoretical and observational effort.
Here we present high precision HST WFC3 observations of the dayside emission
spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD209458b; the first exoplanet suggested to have a
thermal inversion. Our observations resolve a water band in absorption at 6.2
sigma confidence. When combined with Spitzer photometry the data are indicative
of a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure over the range 1-0.001
bar at 7.7 sigma confidence. We test the robustness of our results by exploring
a variety of model assumptions including the temperature profile
parameterization, presence of a cloud, and choice of Spitzer data reduction. We
also introduce a new analysis method, ""chemical retrieval-on-retrieval"", to
determine the elemental abundances from the spectrally retrieved mixing ratios
with thermochemical self-consistency and find plausible abundances consistent
with solar metallicity (0.06 - 10 x solar) and carbon-to-oxygen ratios less
than unity. This work suggests that high-precision spectrophotometric results
are required to robustly infer thermal structures and compositions of
extra-solar planet atmospheres.

family of graphs, and then an exploration of set-theoretic geology.
  Firstly we shall construct a model in which
$2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}=2^{\aleph_{\omega_1+1}}=\aleph_{\omega_1+3}$ but there
is a jointly universal family of size $\aleph_{\omega_1+2}$ of graphs on
$\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$. We take a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ and will use
Radin forcing with interleaved collapses to change $\kappa$ into
$\aleph_{\omega_1}$. Prior to the Radin forcing we perform a preparatory
iteration to add functions from $\kappa^+$ into Radin names for what will
become members of the jointly universal family on $\kappa^+$. The same
technique can be used with any uncountable cardinal in place of $\omega_1$.
  Secondly we explore various topics in set-theoretic geology. We begin by
showing that a class Easton support iteration of $\mathrm{Add}(\kappa,1)$ at
$\kappa$ regular results in a universe that is its own generic mantle. We then
consider set forcings $\mathbb{P}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{S}$
with respective generics $G$, $H$, $I$ and $J$ such that $V[G][I]=V[H][J]$ and
show that $V[G]$ and $V[H]$ must have a shared ground via
$(|\mathbb{R}|+|\mathbb{S}|)^+$-cc forcing. This allows a similar analysis of
the related situation when $\mathbb{P}$ is replaced by a class iteration and
$V[H]$ by a generic ground of $V[G]$. We conclude with a simple
characterisation of the mantle of a class forcing extension, and an
investigation of the possibilities for a version of the intermediate model
theorem that applies to class forcing.

that for a range of wave numbers, resonant and near-resonant triads are

modes that would be inaccessible otherwise. The results are in good agreement
with approximations often done in theories of rotating turbulence, and with the
mechanism of parametric instability proposed to explain the development of
anisotropy in such flows. We also observe that, at least for the moderate

implementing the exact theoretical prescription in realistic situations---for

Our framework is very flexible in the sense that it naturally accommodates
different models for the data, instead of requiring a case-by-case treatment.

quantify and analyze the nonadiabatic transitions during the pulse by employing
adiabatic perturbation theory and exact numerical simulations. We find that,

amplitude, a destructive interference effect leads to a remarkably strong
suppression of transitions between the Floquet states. This effect provides the

longitudinal resistance vanishes whereas the Hall resistance remains at the
quantized value. The realization of the QAH effect may lead to the development

incompatibility between \texttt{ReLU} and element-wise addition and the deep
network initialization problem. The weighted residual network is able to learn
to combine residuals from different layers effectively and efficiently. The
proposed models enjoy a consistent improvement over accuracy and convergence
with increasing depths from 100+ layers to 1000+ layers. Besides, the weighted
residual networks have little more computation and GPU memory burden than the
original residual networks. The networks are optimized by projected stochastic

measurable functions in general, and to simple functions with finite values in
particular. It is shown that the information measure of a function is related
to the time complexity of search problems concerning the functions in question.
Formally, given a Turing reduction from a search problem f(x)=y to another
function g(x), the amount of information about f(x)=y provided by querying g(x)
is exactly equal to the average mutual information I(f;g). As a result, the
average number of queries is I(f=y)/I(f;g), where I(f) is amount of
self-information about the event {f=y}. In the idea case, if I(f=y)/I(f;g) is
polynomial in the size of input and the function g(x) can be computed in
polynomial time, then the problem f(x)=y also has polynomial-time algorithm. As
it turns out, our information-based complexity estimation is a natural setting
in which to study the power of randomized or probabilistic algorithms. Applying
to decision problems, our result provides a strong evidence that P=RP=BPP.
Using brute-force search as a benchmark for efficiency, our results also
support that P!=PP. Further, applying an argument similar to Carnot's work on
measuring the efficiency of an ideal heat engine in thermodynamics, it is shown
that I(f=y)/H(f) is a lower bound on query complexity of solving f(x)=y.
According to Markov's inequality, if I(f=y)/H(f) is exponential in the size of
input, then the probability of f(x)=y having polynomial-time algorithm is a
negative exponential in the size of input. This result enables us to reduce the
problem of proving FP!=FNP to the computation of the entropy of certain simple
functions, such as the subset sum function. As a result, P!=NP is provable,
answering a long-standing open problem.

regularization-based estimators that simultaneously accounts for (i) the
structure of the ambient function space, (ii) the regularity of the true
regression function, and (iii) the adaptability (or qualification) of the
regularization. A simple consequence of this upper bound is that the risk of
the regularization-based estimators matches the minimax rate in a variety of
settings. The general bound also illustrates how some regularization techniques
are more adaptable than others to favorable regularity properties that the true
regression function may possess. This, in particular, demonstrates a striking
difference between kernel ridge regression and kernel principal component
regression. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.

shown to be both theoretically challenging and practically important. In this
paper, we consider the problem of designing revenue optimal dynamic mechanism
for a setting where an auctioneer sells a set of items to a buyer in multiple
stages. At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can
only appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a
multi-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at
that stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.
  In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account
mechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any
stage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank
account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We
first establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this
setting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple
characterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually
rational bank account mechanisms. Based on these characterizations, we then
investigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank account
mechanisms. We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank account
mechanism that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result
is general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot
multi-dimensional mechanism design. Based on the previous mechanism, we further
show that there exists a deterministic bank account mechanism that achieves
constant-factor approximation as well. Finally, we consider the problem of
computing optimal mechanisms when the type space is discrete and provide an
FPTAS via linear and dynamic programming.

Cluster disc galaxies (at the same stellar mass) have redder (g-r) colour by
$\sim$0.2 mag than field galaxies. This reddening is slightly more pronounced

of vector mesons produced in nuclear media during high energy nucleus-nucleus
collisions can be explained as Fano-Feshbach resonances. It has been observed
that the mass distributions of lepton pairs created at meson decays decline
from the traditional Breit-Wigner shape with some excess in the low-mass wing
of the resonance. It is clear that the whole phenomenon is related to some
interaction with the nuclear medium. Moreover, it can be further detalized in
quantum mechanics as the interference of direct and continuum states in
Fano-Feshbach effect. To reveal the nature of the interaction it is proposed to
use a phenomenological model of the additional contribution due to Cherenkov
gluons. They can be created because of the excess of the refractivity index
over 1 just in the low-mass wing as required by the classical Cherenkov
treatment. In quantum mechanics, this requirement is related to the positive
real part of the interaction amplitude in this wing. The corresponding
parameters are found from the comparison with $\rho $-meson data and admit
reasonable explanation.

and a reconstruction scheme on the old cells (Lagrangian mesh). While the are
intensive discussion on reconstruction schemes, there are relative sparse

overlaps was believed complicated and often be avoided. This paper introduces
the mathematical formulation of such a problem and tools to solve the problem.
We propose methods to calculate the overlaps of two dismissable general
quadrilateral mesh of the same logically structure in a planar domain. The
quadrilateral polygon intersection problem is reduced to as a problem that how
an edge in a new mesh intersects with a local frame which consists at most 7
connected edges in the old mesh. As such, locality of the method is persevered.
The alternative direction technique is applied to reduce the dimension of the
searching space. It reduces more than 256 possible intersections between a new
cell with the old tessellation to 34 (17 when considering symmetry)
programmable intersections between an edge and an local frame whenever the
intersection between the old and new cell does not degenerate. At the same
time, we shall how the computational amount of the overlaps depends on the
underlying problem in terms of singular intersection points. A simple and
detailed classification on the type of overlaps is presented, according to
classification, degeneracy of an overlap can be easily identified.

networks like data centers or WANs. Recently, several studies proposed to apply
the SDN principles in the Internet's inter-domain routing as well. This could
offer new routing opportunities and improve the performance of BGP, which can
take minutes to converge to routing changes.
  Previous works have demonstrated that centralization can benefit the
functionality of BGP, and improve its slow convergence that causes severe
packet losses and performance degradation. However, due to (a) the fact that
previous works mainly focus on system design aspects, and (b) the lack of real
deployments, it is not clearly understood yet to what extent inter-domain SDN
can improve performance.
  To this end, in this work, we make the first effort towards analytically
studying the effects of routing centralization on the performance of
inter-domain routing, and, in particular, the convergence time of BGP.
Specifically, we propose a Markovian model for inter-domain networks, where a
subset of nodes (domains) coordinate to centralize their inter-domain routing.
We then derive analytic results that quantify the BGP convergence time under
various network settings (like, SDN penetration, topology, BGP configuration,
etc.). Our analysis and results facilitate the performance evaluation of
inter-domain SDN networks, which have been studied (till now) only through
simulations/emulations that are known to suffer from high time/resource
requirements and limited scalability.

  Decomposition for Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation",,,,"CSTR-2/2016","math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops an efficient implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter
based on a modified Cholesky decomposition for inverse covariance matrix
estimation. This implementation is named EnKF-MC. Background errors
corresponding to distant model components with respect to some radius of
influence are assumed to be conditionally independent. This allows to obtain
sparse estimators of the inverse background error covariance matrix. The
computational effort of the proposed method is discussed and different
formulations based on various matrix identities are provided. Furthermore, an
asymptotic proof of convergence with regard to the ensemble size is presented.
In order to assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed method,
experiments are performed making use of the Atmospheric General Circulation
Model SPEEDY. The results are compared against those obtained using the local
ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF). Tests are performed for dense
observations ($100\%$ and $50\%$ of the model components are observed) as well
as for sparse observations (only $12\%$, $6\%$, and $4\%$ of model components
are observed). The results reveal that the use of modified Cholesky for inverse
covariance matrix estimation can reduce the impact of spurious correlations
during the assimilation cycle, i.e., the results of the proposed method are of
better quality than those obtained via the LETKF in terms of root mean square
error.

  (1) According to the recommendations of International Astronomical Union, the
metric of the Solar system is expressed in terms of intrinsic mass-multipoles
and intrinsic spin-multipoles of the massive bodies, allowing for arbitrary
shape, inner structure and rotational motion of the massive bodies of the Solar
system.
  (2) The Solar system bodies move along arbitrary worldlines which can later
be specified by Solar system ephemeris.

requirement for extremely high-precision astrometry on sub-micro-arcsecond
level of accuracy and associated massive computations in astrometric data
reduction. An estimation of the numerical magnitude for time delay and light

information can have significant impact on the homogeneity of repartition of
bikes in docking stations, and, what is important for a future implementation
of the strategy, that an action on only 30% of regular users is enough to
obtain most of the possible amelioration.

non-interacting fermionic bilayer honeycomb lattices in the presence of
trigonal warping in the energy spectrum, on-site energy difference and uniform
magnetic field. Employing single particle correlation functions, we present an
explicit form for layer-layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is
entanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping,
at zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between
entanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of monolayer which means that the
entanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the
bilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect
correspondence, however, in $\Gamma$-K direction in hexagonal Brillouin zone,
their behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping
parameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of
entanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We
also study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the
entanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and
on-site energy difference. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum versus
magnetic flux has a self similar fractal structure, known Hofstadter butterfly.
Our results also show that the on-site energy difference causes a transition
from the Hofstadter butterfly to a tree-like picture.

irregularly spaced. To model such datasets, the widely used Gaussian process
models in spatial statis- tics face tremendous challenges due to the
prohibitive computational burden. Various ap- proximation methods have been
introduced to reduce the computational cost. However, most of them rely on
unrealistic assumptions for the underlying process and retaining statistical
efficiency remains an issue. We develop a new approximation scheme for maximum
likeli- hood estimation. We show how the composite likelihood method can be
adapted to provide different types of hierarchical low rank approximations that
are both computationally and statistically efficient. The improvement of the
proposed method is explored theoretically; the performance is investigated by
numerical and simulation studies; and the practicality is illustrated through
applying our methods to 2 million measurements of soil moisture in the area of

that agent-to-agent transactions are governed by the price in units of money

linear theory, that there is no regular inner horizon for these solutions.
Then, we address this question fully non-linearly, using as a tractable model
five dimensional, equal spinning, Myers-Perry hairy BHs. We find that, for
non-extremal solutions: $(1)$ the inside spacetime geometry in the vicinity of
the event horizon is smooth and the equations of motion can be integrated

  control of polariton absorption",,,"10.1038/nphys3106",,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to feed energy into a system, or - equivalently - to drive that
system with an external input is a fundamental aspect of light-matter
interaction. The key concept in many photonic applications is the ""critical
coupling"" condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an
input channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was
crucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in
the context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this
so-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are
in fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called
polaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the
critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we
term strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into
polaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or
mechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special
curve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more
general case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology
displayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally
understood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most
importantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based
intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. This result opens
new avenues in the exploration of polariton physics, making it possible to
control the pumping efficiency of a system almost independently of its Rabi
energy, i.e., of the energy exchange rate between the electromagnetic field and
the material transition.

nearly complete for Ks<16.8 at Aj<1.5 in IC 348 and for Ks<16.2 at Aj<3 in NGC
1333, which correspond to masses of <=0.01 Msun for ages of 3 Myr according to
theoretical evolutionary models. The faintest known members extend below these
completeness limits and appear to have masses of ~0.005 Msun. In
extinction-limited samples of cluster members, NGC 1333 exhibits a higher
abundance of objects at lower masses than IC 348. It would be surprising if the
initial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their
similar stellar densities and formation environments. Instead, it is possible
that average extinctions are lower for less massive members of star-forming
clusters, in which case extinction-limited samples could be biased in favor of
low-mass objects in the more heavily embedded clusters like NGC 1333. In the
H-R diagram, the median sequences of IC 348 and NGC 1333 coincide with each
other for the adopted distances of 300 and 235 pc, which would suggest that
they have similar ages. However, NGC 1333 is widely believed to be younger than
IC 348 based on its higher abundance of disks and protostars and its greater
obscuration. Errors in the adopted distances may be responsible for this
discrepancy.

before. However the issue of maintaining a vendor-supplied IS, in particular
standard packaged software, has been poorly represented within academic
literature. This paper presents a conceptual study that synthesises the current
state of research concerning the deferral or execution of vendor-supplied
maintenance by the purchasing organisation. Based on a systematic review
process that adopts the purchasers viewpoint, a series of fears and triggers
emerge and are captured from the literature. Fears are articulated as reasons
for the purchasing organisation deferring the installation of vendor-supplied
maintenance, whereas triggers are events that upset the equilibrium of the
purchasing organisations IS or software and require the installation of the
vendor-supplied maintenance to proceed. Although prevalent in literature, fears
and triggers have not previously been recognised as an area of focus for
academic research.

methods are used: machine and crowdsourced. The chosen translation written
language pair is from English to Simplified Chinese, as these are the official
languages of world's two largest economies (U.S.A and China respectively) that
also have large e-tailing markets. A model based on an integration of two
theories, DeLone & McLean's Information Systems Success Model, and Perceived
Risk Theory, has been developed for testing the impact of translated
information quality. The moderating effect of translation method and
e-retailer's brand influencing customers' tolerance of imperfect translation is
also considered.

challenges in service failure prevention. This work-in-progress paper reports
on the first phase of an action-design research project to develop a service
failure prevention methodology. In this paper we review the literature on
online services, failure prevention and failure recovery and develop a
theoretical framework for online service failure prevention. This provides the
theoretical grounding for the artefact (the methodology) to be developed. We
use this framework to develop an initial draft of our methodology. We then
outline the remaining phases of the research, and offer some initial
conclusions gained from the project to date.

  Resource Based View Perspective","ISBN# 978-0-646-95337-3 Presented at the Australasian Conference on
  Information Systems 2015 (arXiv:1605.01032)",,,"ACIS/2015/41","cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Today, cancer is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world.
This threatening disease has huge negative impacts, not only on quality of
life, but also on the healthcare industry, whose resources are already scarce.
Thus, finding new approaches for cancer care has been a central point of
interest during the last few decades. One of these approaches is the use of
computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems. This systems have the
potential to provide more effective and efficient patient-centric cancer care.
This paper serves to examine the business value of an American CPOE in an
Australian context. This is achieved by using our specifically designed tool to
evaluate the business value of IT in the healthcare, in combination with a
resource based view perspective. Our results show that the system has a number
of enabling resources to generate business value subject to having other
resources.

settings has changed the way employees behave. ICTs such as smartphones, email
and social media makes employees more connected than has ever been possible.
The degree of ICT connectivity can create a positive as well as a negative
impact on employees' productivity. In this context, the notion of ICT
self-discipline - an individual's ability to control their behaviours towards
ICTs - becomes pivotal in the process of managing ICT connectivity. This
follow-on study reports the results of an online survey of 443 to New Zealand
professionals regarding the influence of ICT self-discipline on the
relationship between ICT connectivity and employee productivity. Findings
indicated that the impact of ICT self-discipline varies depending on the
organisation and industry an employee works in. Insights and recommendations
for future research are shared in this paper. Findings from this study
contribute to IS research and practice.

KLJN system. Here we note that GAA's paper contains several invalid statements
regarding security measures and the continuity of functions in classical
physics. These deficiencies are clarified in our present paper, wherein we also
emphasize that a new version of the KLJN system is immune against all existing
attacks, including the one by GAA.

studied by means of a combined use of the Adomian Decomposition Method and the
Laplace Transform (LADM). The results that we have obtained, a series of powers
of functions, have never been reported and show a very good match when compared
with other approximate solutions, obtained by different methods. The method
here proposed works with high degree of accuracy and because it requires less
computational effort, it is very convenient to solve this kind of nonlinear
differential equations.
