The role of Ti ions in the magnetism of MnTiO3 was unclear so here this issue
has been tried to address in this manuscript. The magnetic susceptibility data
shows that the 3-dimensional magnetic character has been improved in the doped
MnTiO3. The x=0 compound goes paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase at a
temperature 64K followed by a broad peak at a temperature 100K . But in x=0.2
compound the antiferromagnetic transition temperature has been shifted towards
the lower temperature to 47.5K with a broad peak at temperature 79K. On the
doping of Ru at Ti site a sharp anomaly is observed 47.5K in the case of x=0.2
compound. This sharp anomaly attributes to the improved 3D character of
magnetism in this compound which is weak in x=0 compound.

AGN in isolated galaxy pairs, we compare with a sample of isolated galaxies
homogeneously selected under the same isolation criterion. We examine the
effect of the large-scale environment by comparing with control samples of
single galaxies and galaxy pairs. In general we found no difference in the
prevalence of optical AGN for the considered samples. For massive galaxies, the
fraction of optical AGN in isolated galaxies is slightly higher than that in
control samples. Also the fraction of passives in high mass isolated galaxies
is smaller than in any other sample. Generally, there is no dependence on
optical nuclear activity with local environment. On the other hand, we found
evidence that radio AGN are strongly affected by the local environment. Optical
AGN phenomenon is related to cold gas accretion, while radio AGN is related to
hot gas accretion. In this context, there is more cold gas, fueling the central
optical AGN, in isolated systems. Our results are in agreement with a scenario
where cold gas accretion by secular evolution is the main driver of optical

Furthermore, many of the available panel data sets are unbalanced in nature,
because of attrition or accretion, and micro-econometric models applied to
panel data are frequently multi-equation models. This paper considers the
general least squares estimation of the heteroscedastic stratified two-way
error component (EC) models of both single equations and seemingly unrelated
regressions (SUR) systems (with cross-equations restrictions) on unbalanced
panel data. The derived heteroscedastic estimators of both single equations and
SUR systems improve the estimation efficiency.

the convergence power spectrum and introducing field rotation. We show
numerically that the lensing convergence power spectrum is affected at the
$\lesssim 0.2\%$ level on accessible scales, and that this correction and the
field rotation are negligible for observations with arcminute beam and noise
levels $\gtrsim 1 \mu {\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}} $. The field rotation
generates $\sim 2.5\%$ of the total lensing B-mode polarization amplitude

making it highly subdominant to the convergence B modes on scales where they
are a source of confusion for the signal from primordial gravitational waves.
Since the post-Born signal is non-linear, it also generates a bispectrum with
the convergence. We show that the post-Born contributions to the bispectrum
substantially change the shape predicted from large-scale structure
non-linearities alone, and hence must be included to estimate the expected
total signal and impact of bispectrum biases on CMB lensing reconstruction
quadratic estimators and other observables. The field-rotation power spectrum
only becomes potentially detectable for noise levels $\ll 1 \mu
{\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}}$, but its bispectrum with the convergence may be
observable at $\sim 3\sigma$ with Stage IV observations. Rotation-induced and
convergence-induced B modes are slightly correlated by the bispectrum, and the
bispectrum also produces additional contributions to the lensed BB power

natural process, we could grow and separate Tooeleite-like templates from

insoluble nano-acidic-surfaces (called as INAS in the manuscript) as nucleation
centres for Tooeleite growth while keeping the overall pH of the aqueous media
neutral. Therefore, we propose a novel method of artificial mineralization of

proposed depth of the HLS ($m < 26.75$), BlueTides predicts $10^6$ galaxies at
$z=8$ with a few up to $z\sim 15$ due to the enhanced bright end of the galaxy
luminosity function. At $z=8$, galaxies in the mock HLS have specific star
formation rates of $\sim 10 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ and ages of $\sim 80 {\rm Myr}$
(both evolving linearly with redshift) and a non-evolving mass-metallicity
relation. BlueTides also predicts $\sim 10^4$ AGN in WFIRST HLS from $z=8$ out
to $z\sim 14$. These AGN host black holes of $M\sim 10^6-10^8 M_\odot$
accreting close to their Eddington luminosity. Galaxies and AGN have host halo
masses of $M_{halo}\sim 10^{11-12} M_\odot$ and a linear bias $b\approx 13-20$.

is overall rather consistent with the available experimental data. However,
there is a tendency towards a too strong centrality dependence. This can be
traced back to the rather small transverse area occupied by small-$x$ gluons in
the nucleon that is seen in the HERA data, compared to the total inelastic
nucleon-nucleon cross section.

largest polyelectrolyte chains have larger excluded volume than the shorter
ones. In regard to the adsorption dependence on the polyelectrolyte
polymerization degree we find that the excluded volume drives the adsorption
throughout the intrachain electrostatic repulsion, because the SiO2 surface is
strongly negative. These results are expected to be useful for several

that these approaches meet the capacity under some constraints on the rate of

the Gaussian case shows that the GPC lead to the capacity of the Gaussian SD-WC

Hence, we achieve the capacity of the Gaussian SD-WC using the dirty paper

  Regression Models",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model from
a set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. The
response is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of
unknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are
assumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the
parameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many
applications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with
additive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications,
particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system
state it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an
approximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the
parameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This
algorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We
specialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to
obtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the
common regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential
and multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family
distribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean
and variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the
context of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these
algorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model
parameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or
Bernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms
described here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting
performance on a simulation.

transparency regime and aimed at a beryllium converter to generate neutrons at
the TRIDENT laser facility. These prompt neutrons have been used for active
interrogation to detect nuclear materials, the first such demonstration of a
laser-driven neutron source. During the experiments, delayed neutrons from
$^9$Li decay was observed. It was identified by its characteristic half-life of
178.3 ms. Production is attributed to the nuclear reactions $^9$Be(d,2p)$^9$Li
and $^9$Be(n,p)$^9$Li inside the beryllium converter itself. These reactions
have energy thresholds of 18.42 and 14.26 MeV respectively, and we estimate the
(d,2p) reaction to be the dominant source of $^9$Li production. Therefore, only
the higher-energy portion of the deuteron spectrum contributes to the
production of the delayed neutrons. It was observed that the delayed-neutron
yield decreases with increasing distance between the converter and the deuteron
source. This behavior is consistent with deuteron production with energy
greater than $\sim$20 MeV within a cone with a half-angle greater than
40$^{\circ}$. Prompt-neutron time-of-flight measurements at varying separation
between the converter and the laser target indicate that the fast deuteron
population above threshold is severely depleted on axis out to
$\sim$20$^{\circ}$. These measurements are consistent with emission of the fast
deuterons (i.e., above 10 MeV/nucleon) in a ring-like fashion around the
central axis. Such an inferred ring-like structure is qualitatively consistent
with a documented signature of the breakout afterburner (BOA) laser-plasma ion
acceleration mechanism. The measurement of $\beta$-delayed neutrons from $^9$Li
decay could provide an important new diagnostic tool for the study of the

extrapolations of the coronal field, and have been inferred to be important for
a broad range of energetic events. These null points and their associated
separatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line
mapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line
mapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and
spine field lines, that can be analysed using the `squashing factor', $Q$. In
this paper we make a detailed analysis of the distribution of $Q$ in the
presence of magnetic nulls. While $Q$ is formally infinite on both the spine
and fan of the null, the decay of $Q$ away from these structures is shown in
general to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of
a non-radially-symmetric null, $Q$ decays most slowly away from the spine/fan
in the direction in which $|{\bf B}|$ increases most slowly. In particular,
this demonstrates that the extended, elliptical high-$Q$ halo around the spine
footpoints observed by Masson et al. (Astrophys. J., 700, 559, 2009) is a
generic feature. This extension of the $Q$ halos around the spine/fan
footpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are
magnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of
this, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of
observed flare ribbons in `circular ribbon flares', in which typically a
coronal null is implicated. We conclude that both the physics in the vicinity
of the null and how this is related to the extension of $Q$ away from the

reconnection at coronal null points.

contradiction, we present a complete theoretical study of the dynamics of
acetylene dication produced by Auger decay after X-ray photoionization of the
carbon atom K shell. We find that isomerization does not occur on the sub-100
fs timescale and is not required to explain the time-resolved Coulomb imaging
experiment. This study resolves the seeming contradiction between experiment
and theory concerning the isomerization time scale in acetylene dication. This
work calls for careful interpretation of structural information from the widely
applied Coulomb momentum imaging method but also points out its strengths in
mapping out momentum dispersion dynamics even when structural variation is
minor.

reconstruct a binary signal defined on the nodes of a weighted graph, by
sampling it on a small subset of the nodes. A new sampling algorithm is
proposed, which sequentially selects the graph nodes to be sampled, based on an
aggressive search for the boundary of the signal over the graph. The algorithm
generalizes a recent method for sampling nodes in unweighted graphs. The
generalization improves the sampling performance using the information gained
from the available graph weights. An analysis of the number of samples required
by the proposed algorithm is provided, and the gain over the unweighted method
is further demonstrated in simulations. Additionally, the proposed method is
compared with an alternative state of-the-art method, which is based on the
graph's spectral properties. It is shown that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the spectral sampling method, if the signal needs to be predicted
with high accuracy. On the other hand, if a higher level of inaccuracy is
tolerable, then the spectral method outperforms the proposed aggressive search
method. Consequently, we propose a hybrid method, which is shown to combine the
advantages of both approaches.

ice damage, but most power grids are not equipped with sensors to pinpoint the
precise location of the faults causing the outage. Instead, utilities have to
depend primarily on phone calls (trouble calls) from customers who have lost
power to guide the dispatching of utility trucks. In this paper, we develop a
policy that routes a utility truck to restore outages in the power grid as
quickly as possible, using phone calls to create beliefs about outages, but
also using utility trucks as a mechanism for collecting additional information.
This means that routing decisions change not only the physical state of the
truck (as it moves from one location to another) and the grid (as the truck
performs repairs), but also our belief about the network, creating the first
stochastic vehicle routing problem that explicitly models information
collection and belief modeling. We address the problem of managing a single
utility truck, which we start by formulating as a sequential stochastic
optimization model which captures our belief about the state of the grid. We
propose a stochastic lookahead policy, and use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
to produce a practical policy that is asymptotically optimal. Simulation
results show that the developed policy restores the power grid much faster

operation of a node in the crashed state is triggered externally, and is
carried out by the concerned node via message exchanges with other active nodes
in the system. Upon completion of repair, the node re-enters active state, and
resumes participation in ongoing and future read, write, and repair operations.
To guarantee liveness and atomicity simultaneously, existing works assume
either the presence of nodes with stable storage, or presence of nodes that
never crash during the execution. We demand neither of these; instead we
consider a natural, yet practical network stability condition $N1$ that only
restricts the number of nodes in the crashed/repair state during broadcast of
any message.
  We present an erasure-code based algorithm $RADON_C$ that is always live, and
guarantees atomicity as long as condition $N1$ holds. In situations when the
number of concurrent writes is limited, $RADON_C$ has significantly improved
storage and communication cost over a replication-based algorithm $RADON_R$,

additional phase during the read and write operations.

representations of a connected acyclic quiver $Q_{\mathcal{R}}$ of tame type,
having a unique isotropic Schur root, say $\delta_{\mathcal{R}}$. The
understanding of the simple objects in $\mathcal{A}(\delta)$ allows us to get a
finite set of generators for the ring of semi-invariants SI$(Q,\delta)$ of $Q$

the representation theory of the category $\mathcal{R}(Q,\delta)$ and from a
beautiful description of the cone of dimension vectors of

best-tuned RBF kernel.
  We conduct extensive experiments for comparing the linearized RBF kernel
using NRFF with the linearized GMM kernel using GCWS. We observe that, to reach
a comparable classification accuracy, GCWS typically requires substantially
fewer samples than NRFF, even on datasets where the original RBF kernel
outperforms the original GMM kernel. The empirical success of GCWS (compared to
NRFF) can also be explained from a theoretical perspective. Firstly, the
relative variance (normalized by the squared expectation) of GCWS is
substantially smaller than that of NRFF, except for the very high similarity
region (where the variances of both methods are close to zero). Secondly, if we
make a model assumption on the data, we can show analytically that GCWS

deformations of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs that are dual to generic AdS$_5$ flux
backgrounds in type IIB or eleven-dimensional supergravity. In the gauge
theory, marginal deformations are parametrised by the space of chiral primary
operators of conformal dimension three, while exactly marginal deformations
correspond to quotienting this space by the complexified global symmetry group.
We show how the supergravity analysis gives a geometric interpretation of the
gauge theory results. The marginal deformations arise from deformations of
generalised structures that solve moment maps for the generalised
diffeomorphism group and have the correct charge under the generalised Reeb
vector, generating the R-symmetry. If this is the only symmetry of the
background, all marginal deformations are exactly marginal. If the background
possesses extra isometries, there are obstructions that come from fixed points
of the moment maps. The exactly marginal deformations are then given by a
further quotient by these extra isometries.
  Our analysis holds for any $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_5$ flux background. Focussing
on the particular case of type IIB Sasaki-Einstein backgrounds we recover the
result that marginal deformations correspond to perturbing the solution by
three-form flux at first order. In various explicit examples, we show that our
expression for the three-form flux matches those in the literature and the
obstruction conditions match the one-loop beta functions of the dual SCFT.

emission-line ratios dominated by star formation. Based on follow-up spectra
taken with the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), the Dual Imaging
Spectrograph, and the Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, we find that the
broad H$\alpha$ emission has faded or was ambiguous for all of the star-forming
objects (14/16) over baselines ranging from 5 to 14 years. For the two objects
in our follow-up sample with narrow-line AGN signatures (RGG 9 and RGG 119), we
find persistent broad H$\alpha$ emission consistent with an AGN origin.
Additionally, we use our MagE observations to measure stellar velocity
dispersions for 15 objects in the Reines et al. (2013) sample, all with
narrow-line ratios indicating the presence of an AGN. Stellar masses range from
$\sim5\times10^{8}$ to $3\times10^{9}$~\msun, and we measure $\sigma_{\ast}$
ranging from $28-71~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$. These $\sigma_{\ast}$ correspond to some
of the lowest-mass galaxies with optical signatures of AGN activity. We show
that RGG 119, the one object which has both a measured $\sigma_{\ast}$ and
persistent broad H$\alpha$ emission, falls near the extrapolation of the $\rm
M_{BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relation to the low-mass end.

of regular metal-poor halo stars. Neutron-capture element abundances Sr and Ba
are systematically lower than the main halo trend, and also show a significant
abundance spread. Overall, this is similar to what has been found for other
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. We apply corrections to the carbon abundances

21% of stars to be carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, compared to 13%

Applying a set of abundance criteria to test to what extent Bootes I could be a

resulted in the two stellar populations observable today.

meaningful information one has to solve the confusion problems caused by
interloping lines from foreground galaxies. We discuss here the challenges for
a Ly-alpha IM experiment targeting z > 4 sources. We find that the Ly-alpha

that the interloping lines (e.g. H-alpha, [O II], [O III] lines) can be
efficiently removed. We show that interlopers can be removed by using an
ancillary photometric galaxy survey with limiting AB mag 26 in the NIR bands
(Y, J, H, or K). This would enable detection of the Ly-alpha signal from 5 < z
< 9 faint sources. However, if a [C II] IM experiment is feasible, by
cross-correlating the Ly-alpha with the [C II] signal the required depth of the
galaxy survey can be decreased to AB mag 24. This would bring the detection at
reach of future facilities working in close synergy.

For realistic values of $\alpha$, the uniaxial anisotropy is of a similar order
of magnitude as the bulk magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Evaluating the uniaxial
anisotropy for a simplified model in 1-d shows that for small band filling, the
in-plane easy axis anisotropy scales as $\alpha^4$ and results from a twisted
exchange interaction between the spins in the 3-d Rashba material and the
ferromagnet. For a ferroelectric 3-d Rashba material, $\hat n$ can be
controlled with an electric field, and we propose that the interfacial magnetic

Using this methodology we investigate the evolution of galaxies at a variety of
number densities from $z=0-3$. We find that samples chosen at number densities
ranging from $3\times10^{-4}$ to 10$^{-5}$ galaxies Mpc$^{-3}$ (corresponding
to $z\sim0.5$ stellar masses of M$_{*}= 10^{10.95-11.6}$ M$_{0}$) have a star
forming blue fraction of $\sim50$\% at $z\sim2.5$, which evolves to a nearly
$100$\% quenched red and dead population by $z\sim 1$. We also see evidence for
number density downsizing, such that the galaxies selected at the lowest
densities (highest masses) become a homogeneous red population before those at
higher number densities. Examining the evolution of the colours for these
systems furthermore shows that the formation redshift of galaxies selected at
these number densities is $z_{\rm form}>3$. The structural evolution through
size and Sersic index fits reveal that while there remains evolution in terms
of galaxies becoming larger and more concentrated in stellar mass at lower
redshifts, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than for a mass
selected sample. We also find that changes in size and structure continues at

electromagnetic wavelength, the heating regime varies and can lead to a total
evaporation of the companion. In particular, we find that inductive heating is
mostly inefficient for small pulsar companions, although it is generally

induction heating for $10^4\,$years at distances as small as $1\,R_\odot$ from
the neutron star. For degenerate companions, induction heating cannot lead to
evaporation and another source of heating (likely by kinetic energy of the

explained in terms of an extraterrestrial flux due to two different components:
a contribution coming from know astrophysical sources for energies up to few
hundreds TeV and a top-down contribution originated by the decay of heavy dark
matter particles with a mass of few PeV. Contrary to previous approaches, we
consider a leptophilic three-body decay that dominates at PeV energies due to
the absence of quarks in the final state. We find that the theoretical
predictions of such a scenario are in a slightly better agreement with the
IceCube data if the astrophysical component has a cut-off at about 100 TeV.
This interpretation of IceCube data can be easily tested in the near future
since the decaying dark matter scenario predicts a sharp cut-off at PeV energy
scale and the observation of an anisotropy towards Galactic Center of our
Galaxy in contrast with the isotropic astrophysical flux.

stars or barium stars with P_b~several yr - feature high eccentricities (up to
0.4) despite the expectation of their efficient tidal circularization during
the AGB phase. It was suggested that the eccentricities of these binaries can
be naturally excited by their tidal coupling to the circumbinary disk, formed
by the material ejected from the binary. Here we critically reassess this idea
using simple arguments rooted in the global angular momentum conservation of
the disk+binary system. Compared to previous studies we (1) fully account for
the viscous spreading of the circumbinary disk, (2) consider the possibility of
reaccretion from the disk onto the binary (in agreement with simulations and
empirical evidence), and (3) allow for the reduced viscosity after the disk
expands, cools, and forms dust. These ingredients conspire to significantly
lower the efficiency of eccentricity excitation by the disk tides. We find that
explaining eccentricities of the post-AGB binaries is difficult and requires
massive ($> 10^{-2}M_\odot$), long-lived ($> 10^5$ yr) circumbinary disks, that
do not reaccrete. Reaccretion is detrimental for the eccentricity growth also
in the MSP+WD systems. Reduced efficiency of the disk-driven excitation
motivates study of alternative mechanisms for producing the peculiar
eccentricities of the post-MS binaries.

promising in the multitude of applications including lasing, light emission and
photovoltaics. In many of these applications it is imperative to understand the
physics of interaction of electrons in a SN with external electromagnetic
fields on the quantitative level. In particular, the strength of
electron-photon coupling determines such important SN parameters as the
radiative lifetime and absorption cross section. This strength is often assumed
to be fully encoded by the so called Kane momentum matrix element. This
parameter, however, pertains to a bulk semiconductor material and, as such, is
not sensitive to the quantum confinement effects in SNs. In this work we
demonstrate that the quantum confinement, via the so called band mixing, can
result in a significant suppression of the strength of electron interaction
with electromagnetic field. Within the envelope function formalism we show how
this suppression can be described by introducing an effective energy-dependent
Kane momentum. Then, the effect of band mixing on the efficiencies of various
photoinduced processes can be fully captured by the conventional formulae
(e.g., spontaneous emission rate), once the conventional Kane momentum is
substituted with the renormalized energy-dependent Kane momentum introduced in
here. As an example, we evaluate the energy-dependent Kane momentum for
spherical $\rm{PbSe}$ and $\rm{PbS}$ SNs (i.e., quantum dots) and show that
neglecting band mixing in these systems can result in the overestimation of
absorption cross sections and emission rates by a factor of $\sim$2.

of the highest production cross sections in SUSY and give rise to final states

mass outflow rates of galaxies. Past estimates have been plagued by uncertain
assumptions about the outflow geometry, metallicity, and ionization fraction.
Here we use Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of
the nearby starburst NGC 6090 to demonstrate that many of these quantities can
be constrained by the data. We use the Si~{\sc IV} absorption lines to
calculate the scaling of velocity (v), covering fraction (C$_f$), and density
with distance from the starburst (r), assuming the Sobolev optical depth and a
velocity law of the form: v$~\propto(1 -\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{i}/\mathrm{r}
)^\beta$ (where R$_\mathrm{i}$ is the inner outflow radius). We find that the
velocity ($\beta$=0.43) is consistent with an outflow driven by an r$^{-2}$
force with the outflow radially accelerated, while the scaling of the covering
fraction ($C_f \propto \mathrm{r}^{-0.82}$) suggests that cool clouds in the
outflow are in pressure equilibrium with an adiabatically expanding medium. We
use the column densities of four weak metal lines and CLOUDY photoionization
models to determine the outflow metallicity, the ionization correction, and the
initial density of the outflow. Combining these values with the profile
fitting, we find R$_\mathrm{i}$ = 63 pc, with most of the mass within 300~pc of
the starburst. Finally, we find that the maximum mass outflow rate is
2.3~M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and the mass loading factor (outflow divided by the

mode overlapping coefficient on the strength of the intermode interaction can
be taken into account through dependence of the coupling coefficient on the

exactly solvable and, in the semiclassical approximation where the microwave

passes the results on to a master node which combines all the slaves' data, and

problem for a graphical model. We discuss this by formulating the problem as a
detection problem. Model selection problems usually minimize a distance between
the original distribution and the model distribution. For the special case of
Gaussian distributions, the model selection problem simplifies to the
covariance selection problem which is widely discussed in literature by
Dempster [2] where the likelihood criterion is maximized or equivalently the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is minimized to compute the model covariance
matrix. While this solution is optimal for Gaussian distributions in the sense
of the KL divergence, it is not optimal when compared with other information
divergences and criteria such as Area Under the Curve (AUC).
  In this paper, we analytically compute upper and lower bounds for the AUC and
discuss the quality of model selection problem using the AUC and its bounds as
an accuracy measure in detection problem. We define the correlation
approximation matrix (CAM) and show that analytical computation of the KL
divergence, the AUC and its bounds only depend on the eigenvalues of CAM. We
also show the relationship between the AUC, the KL divergence and the ROC curve
by optimizing with respect to the ROC curve. In the examples provided, we pick
tree structures as the simplest graphical models. We perform simulations on
fully-connected graphs and compute the tree structured models by applying the
widely used Chow-Liu algorithm [3]. Examples show that the quality of tree
approximation models are not good in general based on information divergences,
the AUC and its bounds when the number of nodes in the graphical model is
large. We show both analytically and by simulations that the 1-AUC for the tree
approximation model decays exponentially as the dimension of graphical model
increases.

lunar swirls (high albedo regions coincident with the regions of surface
magnetization). Different processes have been proposed for their origin. In
this work we test the idea that the lunar swirls have a higher albedo relative
to surrounding regions because they deflect incoming solar wind particles that
would otherwise darken the surface. 3D particle tracking is used to estimate
the influence of five lunar magnetic anomalies on incoming solar wind. The
regions investigated include Mare Ingenii, Gerasimovich, Renier Gamma,
Northwest of Apollo and Marginis. Both protons and electrons are tracked as
they interact with the anomalous magnetic field and impact maps are calculated.
The impact maps are then compared to optical observations and comparisons are
made between the maxima and minima in surface fluxes and the albedo and optical
maturity of the regions. Results show deflection of slow to typical solar wind
particles on a larger scale than the fine scale optical, swirl, features. It is
found that efficiency of a particular anomaly for deflection of incoming
particles does not only scale directly with surface magnetic field strength,
but also is a function of the coherence of the magnetic field. All anomalous
regions can also produce moderate deflection of fast solar wind particles. The
anomalies' influence on ~ 1 GeV SEP particles is only apparent as a slight
modification of the incident velocities.

in computer vision during the last decade, a large number of detectors have
been proposed. The interest in feature-based applications continues to grow and
has thus rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various feature
detection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the good
practices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on the
repeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of the
upper and lower bounds of detector performance and finds statistically
significant performance differences between detectors as a function of image
transformation amount by introducing a new variant of McNemars test in an
effort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. The proposed
framework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions for
several state-of-the-art detectors and to identify their statistical
performance differences for three specific image transformations: JPEG
compression, uniform light changes and blurring. The results are obtained using
a newly acquired, large image database (20482) images with 539 different
scenes. These results provide new insights into the behaviour of detectors and
are also useful from the vision systems design perspective.

surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding
of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In
this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality
metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four
widely-used network clustering algorithms -- Louvain, Infomap, label
propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality
metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the
information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual
information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous
work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes
varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.
  We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster
quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4
out of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find
conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best
indicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the
variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be
assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.
  Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but
discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it
absolutely superior. Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the
tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap
was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs
poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and
accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.

time trying different types of MCMC approaches. This article was motivated by
an application to quantitative advertising in which we encountered extremely
poor computational performance for common data augmentation MCMC algorithms but
obtained excellent performance for adaptive Metropolis. To obtain a deeper
understanding of this behavior, we give strong theory results on computational
complexity in an infinitely imbalanced asymptotic regime. Our results show
computational complexity of Metropolis is logarithmic in sample size, while
data augmentation is polynomial in sample size. The root cause of poor
performance of data augmentation is a discrepancy between the rates at which
the target density and MCMC step sizes concentrate. In general, MCMC algorithms
that have a similar discrepancy will fail in large samples - a result with
substantial practical impact.

machines (RBMs) from Bernoulli random variables to other exponential families
(Welling et al., 2005), are generative models that can be trained with
unsupervised-learning techniques, like contrastive divergence (Hinton et al.
2006; Hinton, 2002), as density estimators for static data. Methods for
extending RBMs--and likewise EFHs--to data with temporal dependencies have been
proposed previously (Sutskever and Hinton, 2007; Sutskever et al., 2009), the
learning procedure being validated by qualitative assessment of the generative
model. Here we propose and justify, from a very different perspective, an
alternative training procedure, proving sufficient conditions for optimal
inference under that procedure. The resulting algorithm can be learned with
only forward passes through the data--backprop-through-time is not required, as
in previous approaches. The proof exploits a recent result about information
retention in density estimators (Makin and Sabes, 2015), and applies it to a
""recurrent EFH"" (rEFH) by induction. Finally, we demonstrate optimality by
simulation, testing the rEFH: (1) as a filter on training data generated with a
linear dynamical system, the position of which is noisily reported by a
population of ""neurons"" with Poisson-distributed spike counts; and (2) with the
qualitative experiments proposed by Sutskever et al. (2009).

of an exact condition by the non-equilibrium exchange-correlation kernel of
TDDFT. Here we give details on the derivation and discuss reformulations of the
exact condition that apply in special cases. In its most general form, the
condition states that when a system is left in an arbitrary state, in the
absence of time-dependent external fields nor ionic motion, the TDDFT resonance
position for a given transition is independent of the state. Special cases
include the invariance of TDDFT resonances computed with respect to any
reference interacting stationary state of a fixed potential, and with respect
to any choice of appropriate stationary Kohn-Sham reference state. We then
present several case studies, including one that utilizes the
adiabatically-exact approximation, that illustrate the conditions and the
impact of their violation on the accuracy of the ensuing dynamics. In
particular, charge-transfer across a long-range molecule is hampered, and we
show how adjusting the frequency of a driving field to match the time-dependent
shift in the charge-transfer resonance frequency, results in a larger charge
transfer over time.

cause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can
limit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO

the model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS

Model in the dimensional regularization is usually regarded to be an
exceptional property of a specific regularization. To understand what is going
on in the dimensional regularization, we illustrate how to reproduce the
results of the dimensional regularization for the $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory in
the more conventional regularization such as the higher derivative
regularization; the basic postulate involved is that the quadratically
divergent induced mass, which is independent of the scale change of the
physical mass, is kinematical and unphysical. This is consistent with the
derivation of the Callan-Symanzik equation, which is a comparison of two
theories with slightly different masses, for the $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory
without encountering the quadratic divergence. We thus suggest that the
dimensional regularization is generic in a bottom-up approach starting with a
successful low-energy theory. We also define a modified version of the mass
independent renormalization for a scalar field which leads to the homogeneous
renormalization group equation. Implications of the present analysis on the
Standard Model at high energies and the presence or absence of SUSY at LHC

concern about secure and reliable power system operation. Due to the
intermittent nature of wind, the base-load units need to cycle significantly
more than they were designed for, resulting in reduced life cycle and increased
costs. Therefore, it is becoming necessary for wind turbines to take part in
frequency control, and reduce the need for additional ancillary services
provided by conventional generators. In this paper, we propose an optimised
operation strategy for the wind farms. In this strategy, we maximise the
kinetic energy of wind turbines by an optimal combination of the rotor speed
and the pitch angle. We exploit the wake interaction in a wind farm, and
de-load some of the up-wind turbines. We show that the kinetic energy
accumulated in the rotating masses of the WTs can be increased compared to the
base case without compromising efficiency of the wind farm. In a specific
system, we show that by implementing this strategy, and injecting the stored
kinetic energy of the WTs' rotors into the system during a frequency dip, we
can delay the system frequency nadir up to 30 s.

and few-femtosecond temporal resolutions. While laser induced electron
diffraction can meet these requirements, it was recently concluded that
molecules with particular orbital symmetries (such as {\pi}g) cannot be imaged
using purely backscattering electron wave packets without molecular alignment.
Here, we demonstrate, in direct contradiction to these findings, that the
orientation and shape of molecular orbitals presents no impediment for
retrieving molecular structure with adequate sampling of the momentum transfer
space. We overcome previous issues by showcasing retrieval of the structure of
randomly oriented O2 and C2H2 molecules, with {\pi}g and {\pi}u symmetries,
respectively, and where their ionisation probabilities do not maximise along
their molecular axes. While this removes a serious bottleneck for laser induced

hyperspectral image classification. While extensive studies have focused on
developing methods to improve the classification accuracy, experimental setting
and design for method evaluation have drawn little attention. In the scope of
supervised classification, we find that traditional experimental designs for
spectral processing are often improperly used in the spectral-spatial
processing context, leading to unfair or biased performance evaluation. This is
especially the case when training and testing samples are randomly drawn from
the same image - a practice that has been commonly adopted in the experiments.
Under such setting, the dependence caused by overlap between the training and
testing samples may be artificially enhanced by some spatial information
processing methods such as spatial filtering and morphological operation. Such
interaction between training and testing sets has violated data independence
assumption that is abided by supervised learning theory and performance
evaluation mechanism. Therefore, the widely adopted pixel-based random sampling
strategy is not always suitable to evaluate spectral-spatial classification
algorithms because it is difficult to determine whether the improvement of
classification accuracy is caused by incorporating spatial information into
classifier or by increasing the overlap between training and testing samples.
To partially solve this problem, we propose a novel controlled random sampling
strategy for spectral-spatial methods. It can greatly reduce the overlap
between training and testing samples and provides more objective and accurate
evaluation.

within the family of aligned solutions and of the Griffiths metrics within the
family of the non-aligned solutions. As a corollary also the double alignment
of the Debever-McLenaghan 'class D' metrics with non-vanishing cosmological
constant is shown to be equivalent with the shear-free and geodesic behaviour
of their Debever-Penrose vectors.

significantly change demand patterns of future power systems and, consequently,
their dynamic performance. In this paper, we propose a generic demand model
that captures the aggregated effect of a large population of price-responsive
users equipped with small-scale PV-battery systems, called prosumers, for
market simulation in future grid scenario analysis. The model is formulated as
a bi-level program in which the upper-level unit commitment problem minimizes
the total generation cost, and the lower-level problem maximizes prosumers'
aggregate self-consumption. Unlike in the existing bi-level optimization
frameworks that focus on the interaction between the wholesale market and an
aggregator, the coupling is through the prosumers' demand, not through the
electricity price. That renders the proposed model market structure agnostic,
making it suitable for future grid studies where the market structure is
potentially unknown. As a case study, we perform steady-state voltage stability
analysis of a simplified model of the Australian National Electricity Market
with significant penetration of renewable generation. The simulation results
show that a high prosumer penetration changes the demand profile in ways that
significantly improve the system loadability, which confirms the suitability of
the proposed model for future grid studies.

consists of a feedback and a feedforward loop, provides fast responses, and is
stable.

studied in this paper. The incidence of debris discs per spectral type is
analysed and put into context together with other parameters of the sample,
like metallicity, rotation and activity, and age.
  The subsample of 105 stars with d<15 pc containing 23 F, 33 G and 49 K stars,
is complete for F stars, almost complete for G stars and contains a substantial
number of K stars to draw solid conclusions on objects of this spectral type.
The incidence rates of debris discs per spectral type 0.26 (6 objects with
excesses out of 23 F stars), 0.21 (7 out of 33 G stars) and 0.20 (10 out of 49

L_dust/L_* for each spectral type are 7.8E-7 (F), 1.4E-6 (G) and 2.2E-6 (K);
the lowest values being around 4.0E-7. The incidence of debris discs is similar
for active (young) and inactive (old) stars. The fractional luminosity tends to

random numbers is to consider a potential behaviour of a Turing machine and its
probability with respect to a measure (or semi-measure) on the input space of
binary codes. For example, Chaitin's Omega is a well known Martin-Loef random
number that is obtained by considering the halting probability of a universal
prefix-free machine. In the last decade, similar examples have been obtained
for higher forms of randomness, i.e. randomness relative to strong oracles. In
this work we obtain characterizations of the algorithmically random reals in
higher randomness classes, as probabilities of certain events that can happen
when an oracle universal machine runs probabilistically on a random oracle.
Moreover we apply our analysis to different machine models, including oracle
Turing machines, prefix-free machines, and models for infinite online
computation. We find that in many cases the arithmetical complexity of a
property is directly reflected in the strength of the algorithmic randomness of
the probability with which it occurs, on any given universal machine. On the
other hand, we point to many examples where this does not happen and the
probability is a number whose algorithmic randomness is not the maximum
possible (with respect to its arithmetical complexity). Finally we find that,
unlike the halting probability of a universal machine, the probabilities of
more complex properties like totality, cofinality, computability or
completeness do not necessarily have the same Turing degree when they are
defined with respect to different universal machines.

especially those who primarily rely on ad- vertising to support their services.
To address this threat, publishers have started retaliating by employing
ad-block detectors, which scout for ad-blocker users and react to them by
restricting their content access and pushing them to whitelist the website or
disabling ad-blockers altogether. The clash between ad-blockers and ad-block
detectors has resulted in a new arms race on the web. In this paper, we present
the first systematic measurement and analysis of ad-block detection on the web.
We have designed and implemented a machine learning based tech- nique to
automatically detect ad-block detection, and use it to study the deployment of
ad-block detectors on Alexa top- 100K websites. The approach is promising with
precision of 94.8% and recall of 93.1%. We characterize the spectrum of
different strategies used by websites for ad-block detection. We find that most
of publishers use fairly simple passive ap- proaches for ad-block detection.
However, we also note that a few websites use third-party services, e.g.
PageFair, for ad-block detection and response. The third-party services use
active deception and other sophisticated tactics to de- tect ad-blockers. We
also find that the third-party services can successfully circumvent ad-blockers

virtualization have been introduced to tackle these problems. They replace the
hardware-based network service components and network control mechanisms with
software components running on general-purpose hardware, aiming at decreasing
costs and complexity of implementing new services, maintaining the implemented
services, and managing available resources in service provisioning platforms
and underlying infrastructures. To experience the full potential of these
approaches, innovative development support tools and service provisioning
environments are needed. To answer these needs, we introduce the SONATA
architecture, a service programming, orchestration, and management framework.
We present a development toolchain for virtualized network services, fully
integrated with a service platform and orchestration system. We motivate the
modular and flexible architecture of our system and discuss its main components
and features, such as function- and service-specific managers that allow fine-

potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we

the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries
among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the
discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development
relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms

suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported
by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed

linear time-varying (LTV) channels to give a proper characterization of the
mobile-to-mobile underwater channel. We find different connections between the
linear time-invariant (LTI) CIR of the static channel and two definitions of
LTV CIRs of the dynamic mobile-to-mobile channel. These connections are useful
to design a dynamic channel simulator from the static channel models available
in the literature. Such feature is particularly interesting for overspread
channels, which are hard to characterize by a measuring campaign. Specifically,
the shallow water acoustic (SWA) channel is potentially overspread due the
signal low velocity of propagation which prompt long delay spread responses and
great Doppler effect. Furthermore, from these connections between the LTI
static CIRs and the LTV dynamic CIRS, we find that the SWA mobile-to-mobile CIR
does not only depend on the relative velocity between transceivers, but also on
the absolute velocity of each of them referred to the velocity of propagation.
Nevertheless, publications about this topic do not consider it and formulate
their equations in terms of the relative velocity between transceivers. We
illustrate our find using two couples of examples where, even though the
relative velocity between the mobiles is the same, their CIRs are not.

scheduling is infeasible. In such scenarios, random access is a natural choice.
The proposed access protocol relies on two essential properties of a massive

asymptotic invariance of channel powers. Signal processing techniques that take
advantage of these properties allow us to view a set of contaminated pilot
signals as a graph code on which iterative belief propagation can be performed.
This makes it possible to decontaminate pilot signals and increase the
throughput of the system. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed access

tracker simply matches the initial patch of the target in the first frame with
candidates in a new frame and returns the most similar patch by a learned
matching function. The strength of the matching function comes from being
extensively trained generically, i.e., without any data of the target, using a
Siamese deep neural network, which we design for tracking. Once learned, the
matching function is used as is, without any adapting, to track previously
unseen targets. It turns out that the learned matching function is so powerful
that a simple tracker built upon it, coined Siamese INstance search Tracker,
SINT, which only uses the original observation of the target from the first

proposed tracker even allows for target re-identification after the target was

heterogeneities of sample deuteration at different length scales. The
progressive exchange between the protons (H) of the proteins and the deuteriums

T_c\approx 74 K leaves a clear fingerprint on the temperature dependence of the

conventional, driven by the thermal expansion and anharmonicity. The Raman
modes are rather broad due to the electron-phonon coupling increased by the
disorder and spin fluctuation effects. In the FM phase the phonon frequency of
both modes increases, while an opposite trend is seen in their linewidth: the
A_{1g} mode narrows in the FM phase, whereas the B_{1g} mode broadens. We argue
that the large asymmetry and anomalous frequency shift of the B_{1g} mode is
due to the coupling of spin fluctuations and vibration. Our density functional

devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key
challenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors
and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between
passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter
communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication
(WP-BackCom) network. In the network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are
deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals
to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits
data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a
carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude
less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of
low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In
this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process
in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad-hoc
pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form
random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from
and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the
transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB.
Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission
capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters,
including backscatter duty cycle and reflection coefficient, as well as the PB
density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are
characterized.

order in QCD. In order to naturally avoid the presence of flavour changing
neutral currents at the tree level, we impose two softly-broken discrete $Z_2$
symmetries. This gives rise to five independent types of 3HDMs that differ in
their Yukawa couplings. We show that in all these 3HDMs (including the case of
type-II-like Yukawa interactions) both masses of the two charged Higgs bosons
$m_{H_1^\pm}$ and $m_{H_2^\pm}$ can be smaller than the top mass $m_t$ while
complying with the constraints from $B\to X_s\gamma$. As an interesting
phenomenological consequence, the branching ratios of the charged Higgs bosons
decay into the $cb$ final states can be as large as $80\%$ when their masses
are taken to be below $m_t$ in two of the five 3HDMs (named as Type-Y and
Type-Z). This light charged Higgs boson scenario provides a hallmark 3HDM
signature that cannot be realised in $Z_2$ symmetric 2-Higgs doublet models. We
find that in the Type-Y and Type-Z 3HDMs the scenario with $90\,{\rm GeV}<

direct searches at LEP2, Tevatron and LHC due to the reduced sensitivity of
these searches to the degenerate case $m_{H_1^\pm}\approx m_{W^\pm}$. The cases
where only one or both charged Higgs bosons are above the top quark mass are
also naturally allowed in the both Type-Y and Type-Z 3HDMs.

and magnetic diffusion. Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of
stratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating
spherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to
2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high
thermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the
bottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.
For sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at
mid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased. This coincides with a
change in the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to
equatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the cyclic solutions disappear at
the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. The total magnetic energy increases with
the magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here ($5-151$), but the
energies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds
numbers. The differential rotation is strongly affected by the magnetic fields
and almost vanishes at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. In some of our
most turbulent cases we find that two regimes are possible where either
differential rotation is strong and mean magnetic fields relatively weak or
vice versa. Conclusions: Our simulations indicate a strong non-linear feedback
of magnetic fields on differential rotation, leading to qualitative changes in
the behaviors of large-scale dynamos at high magnetic Reynolds numbers.
Furthermore, we do not find indications of the simulations approaching an
asymptotic regime where the results would be independent of diffusion
coefficients.

focus in this work on subsets of quadratic monomials M such that generic
systems with support M do not admit any solution at all. For these systems,
Hilbert's Nullstellensatz ensures the existence of algebraic certificates of
inconsistency. However, up to our knowledge all known bounds on the sizes of

precisely, we show that if M is picked uniformly at random among the subsets of
n + k + 1 quadratic monomials containing at least $\Omega$(n 1/2+$\epsilon$)
squares, then the probability that the inequality holds tends to 1 as n grows.
Interestingly, this phenomenon is related with the matching number of random
graphs in the Erd{\""o}s-Renyi model. Finally, we provide experimental results
showing that certificates in inconsistency can be computed for systems with
more than 10000 variables and equations.

identify the dominant locations of free electrons along their lines of sight
and thus constrain the distances of the burst sources themselves. We establish
the average $\tau$-DM relation for Galactic pulsars and use it as a benchmark
for discussing FRB scattering. Though scattering times $\tau$ for FRBs are
large in the majority of the 17 events we analyze, they are systematically
smaller than those of Galactic pulsars that have similar dispersion measures
(DMs). The lack of any correlation between $\tau$ and DM for FRBs suggests that
the intergalactic medium (IGM) cannot account for both $\tau$ and DM. We
therefore consider mixed models involving the IGM and host galaxies. If the IGM
contributes significantly to DM while host galaxies dominate $\tau$, the
scattering deficit with respect to the mean Galactic trend can be explained
with a $\tau$-DM relation in the host that matches that for the Milky Way.
However, it is possible that hosts dominate both $\tau$ and DM, in which case
the observed scattering deficits require free electrons in the host to be less
turbulent than in the Galaxy, such as if they are in hot rather than warm
ionized regions. Our results imply that distances or redshifts of FRB sources
can be significantly overestimated if they are based on the assumption that the
extragalactic portion of DM is dominated by the IGM.

  variability analysis",,,,,"q-bio.QM nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  $\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time
series suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats
etc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.
10 $\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce
the influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.
This can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended
data less appropriate. $\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect
(linear \& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability
of long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15
congestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).
$\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods
: multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \&
Sample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending
affects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal
analysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the
SDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The
cross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR
data or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs
distribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this
processing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus
rhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different
complexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar ,
in terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD
showed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the
exponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these
complexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\bullet$
Conclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data,
which has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending
could be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.
Exceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to
avoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\bullet$

can be protected from decoherence through dynamical decoupling. Then we develop
dynamical decoupling for continuous variable systems which are described by
quadratic Hamiltonians. We identify a condition and a set of operations that
allow us to map a set of interacting harmonic oscillators onto a set of
non-interacting oscillators rotating with an averaged frequency, a procedure we
call homogenization. Furthermore we show that every quadratic
system-environment interaction can be suppressed with two simple operations
acting only on the system. Using a random dynamical decoupling or
homogenization scheme, we develop bounds that characterize how fast we have to
work in order to achieve the desired uncoupled dynamics. This allows us to
identify how well homogenization can be achieved and decoherence can be
suppressed in continuous variable systems.

neutrino the laboratory based on SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia) was
created to search for oscillations of reactor antineutrino. The prototype of a
multi-section neutrino detector with liquid scintillator volume of 350 l was
installed in the middle of 2015. It is a moveable inside the passive shielding
detector, which can be set at distance range from 6 to 11 meters from the
reactor core. Measurements of antineutrino flux at such small distances from
the reactor core carried out with movable detector for the first time. The
measurements carried out with detector prototype demonstrated a possibility of
measuring a reactor antineutrino flux in difficult conditions of cosmic
background at Earth surface.

complex-valued vector time series is proper, i.e., for testing whether the
vector time series is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate. If the
hypothesis is rejected, frequency bands causing the rejection will be
identified and might usefully be related to known properties of the physical
processes. The test needs the associated spectral matrix which can be estimated
by multitaper methods using, say, $K$ tapers. Standard asymptotic distributions
for the test statistic are of no use since they would require $K \rightarrow
\infty,$ but, as $K$ increases so does resolution bandwidth which causes
spectral blurring. In many analyses $K$ is necessarily kept small, and hence
our efforts are directed at practical and accurate methodology for hypothesis
testing for small $K.$ Our generalized likelihood ratio statistic combined with
exact cumulant matching gives very accurate rejection percentages and
outperforms other methods. We also prove that the statistic on which the test
is based is comprised of canonical coherencies arising from our complex-valued
vector time series.Our methodology is demonstrated on ocean current data
collected at different depths in the Labrador Sea. Overall this work extends
results on propriety testing for complex-valued vectors to the complex-valued
vector time series setting.

distinguishing property: its linear size increases with the energy. The horizon
dynamics is equivalently described in terms of a particle moving in
gravitational potential derived from the horizon equation itself in a
self-consistent manner. The particle turning-points match the radius of the
inner and outer horizons of a charged black hole. This classical model pave the
way towards the wave equation for a truly quantum black hole. We compute the

describe the classical limit in which the quantum picture correctly approaches

report the detection of a signal at $\sim$8 $\sigma$ statistical significance

flux: the source is observed at high energies only during the hard X-ray
spectral state, when the source is known to display persistent, relativistic
radio emitting jets. The energy spectrum, extending up to $\sim$20 GeV without
any sign of spectral break, is well fitted by a power-law function with a

high-energy emission mostly coming around the superior conjunction.
Conclusions: We detected GeV emission from Cygnus X-1 and probed that the
emission is most likely associated with the relativistic jets. The evidence of
flux orbital variability points to the anisotropic inverse Compton on stellar

obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows
the practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to

presented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational

maximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic

more relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms.

absorber layers in thin-film photovoltaic cells. When growing films of these
compounds, however, they are often found to contain CuAu- like domains, a
metastable phase of chalcopyrite. It has been reported that for CuInS2, the
presence of the CuAu-like phase improves the short circuit current of the
chalcopyrite-based photovoltaic cell. We investigate the thermodynamic
stability of both phases for a selected list of I-III-VI2 materials using a
first-principles density functional theory approach. For the CuIn-VI2
compounds, the difference in formation energy between the chalcopyrite and
CuAu-like phase is found to be close to 2 meV/atom, indicating a high
likelihood of the presence of CuAu-like domains. Next, we calculate the
Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) of the CuAu- like phase and
compare the results with those of the corresponding chalcopyrite phase. We
identify several candidates with a high efficiency, such as CuAu-like CuInS2,
for which we obtain an SLME of 29% at a thickness of 500 nm. We observe that
the SLME can have values above the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit, and show that
this can occur because the SQ limit assumes the absorptivity to be a step
function, thus overestimating the radiative recombination in the detailed
balance approach. This means that it is possible to find higher theoretical
efficiencies within this framework simply by calculating the J-V characteristic
with an absorption spectrum. Finally, we expand our SLME analysis to indirect
band gap absorbers by studying silicon, and find that the SLME quickly
overestimates the reverse saturation current of indirect band gap materials,
drastically lowering their calculated efficiency.

information they distribute among storage nodes.
  In this work we present a unified framework for verifying confidentiality of
dispersal algorithms against probabilistic models of intruders. Two models of
intruders are given, corresponding to different types of attackers: one aiming
at intercepting as many slices of information as possible, and the other aiming
at attacking the storage providers in the network. Both try to recover the
original information, given the intercepted slices. By using probabilistic
model checking, we can measure the degree of confidentiality of the system
exploring exhaustively all possible behaviors. Our experiments suggest that
dispersal algorithms ensure a high degree of confidentiality against the slice
intruder, no matter the number of storage providers in the system. On the
contrary, they show a low level of confidentiality against the provider
intruder in networks with few storage providers (e.g. interconnected cloud
storage solutions).

Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) alloy is a good passenger since it allows to

The choice of the main structure of the InGaN solar cell is however crucial.
Obtaining a high efficiency requires to improve the light absorption and the
photogenerated carriers collection that depend on the layers parameters,
including the Indium composition, p-and n-doping, device geometry.. .
Unfortunately, one of the main drawbacks of InGaN is linked to its p-type
doping, which is very difficult to realize since it involves complex
technological processes that are difficult to master and that highly impact the
layer quality. In this paper, the InGaN p-n junction (PN) and p-in junction
(PIN) based solar cells are numerically studied using the most realistic
models, and optimized through mathematically rigorous multivariate optimization
approaches. This analysis evidences optimal efficiencies of 17.8% and 19.0% for
the PN and PIN structures. It also leads to propose, analyze and optimize
player free InGaN Schottky-Based Solar Cells (SBSC): the Schottky structure and
a new MIN structure for which the optimal efficiencies are shown to be a little
higher than for the conventional structures: respectively 18.2% and 19.8%. The
tolerance that is allowed on each parameter for each of the proposed cells has
been studied. The new MIN structure is shown to exhibit the widest tolerances
on the layers thicknesses and dopings. In addition to its being player free,
this is another advantage of the MIN structure since it implies its better
reliability. Therefore, these new InGaN SBSC are shown to be alternatives to
the conventional structures that allow removing the p-type doping of InGaN
while giving photovoltaic (PV) performances at least comparable to the standard
multilayers PN or PIN structures.

we present a new superpixel algorithm called Hierarchical Piecewise-Constant
Super-regions (HPCS), which not only obtains superpixels comparable to the

n-th order super-regions. In essence, a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based
anisotropic denoising formulation over the quantized feature space is adopted
to form piecewise-constant image regions, which are then combined with a
graph-based split & merge post-processing step to form superpixels. The graph

it hierarchically to preserve boundary adherence with fewer superpixels.
Experimental results show that, despite the simplicity of our framework, it is
able to provide high quality superpixels, and to hierarchically apply them to
form layers of over-segmentation, each with a decreasing number of superpixels,
while maintaining the same desired properties (such as adherence to strong
image edges). The algorithm is also memory efficient and has a low

requirements (unsoundness) or suffer from poor scalability due to the inherent
complexity of the KB debugging problem. Even if a system is complete and sound
and considers only minimal solutions, there are generally exponentially many
solution candidates to select one from. However, any two repaired KBs obtained
from these candidates differ in their semantics in terms of entailments and
non-entailments. Selection of just any of these repaired KBs might result in
unexpected entailments, the loss of desired entailments or unwanted changes to
the KB.
  This work proposes complete, sound and optimal methods for the interactive
debugging of KBs that suggest the one (minimally invasive) error correction of
the faulty KB that yields a repaired KB with exactly the intended semantics.
Users, e.g. domain experts, are involved in the debugging process by answering
automatically generated queries about the intended domain.

  Junction Flow","30 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wing-body junction flows occur when a boundary layer encounters an airfoil
mounted on the surface. The corner flow near the trailing edge is challenging
for the linear eddy viscosity Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models,
due to the interaction of two perpendicular boundary layers which leads to
highly anisotropic Reynolds stress at the near wall region. Recently, Xiao et
al. proposed a physics-informed Bayesian framework to quantify and reduce the
model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing sparse observation
data. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate the use of wall
function in RANS simulations, and apply the extended framework to the RANS
simulation of wing-body junction flow. Standard RANS simulations are performed
on a 3:2 elliptic nose and NACA0020 tail cylinder joined at their maximum
thickness location. Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity
and the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental
data at the corner region near the trailing edge. On the other hand, the prior
velocity profiles at the leading edge indicate the restriction of uncertainty
space and the performance of the framework at this region is less effective. By
perturbing the orientation of Reynolds stress, the uncertainty range of prior
velocity profiles at the leading edge covers the experimental data. It
indicates that the uncertainty of RANS predicted velocity field is more related
to the uncertainty in the orientation of Reynolds stress at the region with
rapid change of mean strain rate. The present work not only demonstrates the
capability of Bayesian framework in improving the RANS simulation of wing-body
junction flow, but also reveals the major source of model-form uncertainty for
this flow, which can be useful in assisting RANS modeling.

understand the conditions of the cool plasma and magnetism in `atypical'
prominences, namely when the measured inclination of the magnetic field
departs, to some extent, from the predominantly horizontal field found in
`typical' prominences. What is the role of the magnetic field in these
prominence types? Are plasma dynamics more important in these cases than the
magnetic support? We focus our study on three types of `atypical' prominences
(tornadoes, bubbles and jet-like prominence eruptions) that have all been
observed by THEMIS in the He I D_3 line, from which the Stokes parameters can
be derived. The magnetic field strength, inclination and azimuth in each pixel
are obtained by using the Principal Component Analysis inversion method on a
model of single scattering in the presence of the Hanle effect. The magnetic
field in tornadoes is found to be more or less horizontal, whereas for the
eruptive prominence it is mostly vertical. We estimate a tendency towards
higher values of magnetic field strength inside the bubbles than outside in the
surrounding prominence. In all of the models in our database, only one magnetic
field orientation is considered for each pixel. While sufficient for most of
the main prominence body, this assumption appears to be oversimplified in
atypical prominence structures. We should consider these observations as the
result of superposition of multiple magnetic fields, possibly even with a
turbulent field component.

feasibility measure. The framework includes several existing algorithms as
special cases such as a primal-dual method for bilinear saddle-point problems
(PD-S), the proximal Jacobian ADMM (Prox-JADMM) and a randomized variant of the
ADMM method for multi-block convex optimization. Our analysis recovers and/or
strengthens the convergence properties of several existing algorithms. For
example, for PD-S our result leads to the same order of convergence rate
without the previously assumed boundedness condition on the constraint sets,
and for Prox-JADMM the new result provides convergence rate in terms of the
objective value and the feasibility violation. It is well known that the
original ADMM may fail to converge when the number of blocks exceeds two. Our
result shows that if an appropriate randomization procedure is invoked to
select the updating blocks, then a sublinear rate of convergence in expectation
can be guaranteed for multi-block ADMM, without assuming any strong convexity.
The new approach is also extended to solve problems where only a stochastic
approximation of the (sub-)gradient of the objective is available, and we
establish an $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ convergence rate of the extended approach for
solving stochastic programming.

  Analysing the compatibility of this filtration with the

two critical points to be connected by a flow line. As an application, we can
use this to construct Hecke modifications of Higgs bundles via the
Yang-Mills-Higgs flow. When the Higgs field is zero (corresponding to the
Yang-Mills flow), this criterion has a geometric interpretation in terms of
secant varieties of the projectivisation of the underlying bundle inside the
unstable manifold of a critical point, which gives a precise description of
broken and unbroken flow lines connecting two critical points. For non-zero
Higgs field, at generic critical points the analogous interpretation involves
the secant varieties of the spectral curve of the Higgs bundle.

central cusps (e.g. NFW, Navarro et al. 1996). This contradicts observations of
gas kinematics in low-mass galaxies that imply the existence of shallow DM
cores. Baryonic processes such as adiabatic contraction and gas outflows can,
in principle, alter the initial DM density profile, yet their relative
contributions to the halo transformation remain uncertain. Recent high
resolution, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Di Cintio et al. 2014, DC14)
predict that inner density profiles depend systematically on the ratio of
stellar to DM mass (M$_*$/M$_{\text{halo}}$). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
approach, we test the NFW and the M$_*$/M$_{\text{halo}}$-dependent DC14 halo
models against a sample of 147 galaxy rotation curves from the new {\it
Spitzer} Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data set. These
galaxies all have extended H{\small I} rotation curves from radio
interferometry as well as accurate stellar mass density profiles from
near-infrared photometry. The DC14 halo profile provides markedly better fits
to the data compared to the NFW profile. Unlike NFW, the DC14 halo parameters
found in our rotation curve fits naturally fall within two standard deviations
of the mass-concentration relation predicted by $\Lambda$CDM and the stellar
mass-halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching with few outliers.
Halo profiles modified by baryonic processes are therefore more consistent with
expectations from $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology and
provide better fits to galaxy rotation curves across a wide range of galaxy
properties than do halo models that neglect baryonic physics. Our results offer
a solution to the decade long cusp-core discrepancy.

cosmological structure formation, and works extraordinarily well on large,
linear, scales. Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able
to understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and
its alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying
code, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark
matter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear
matter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed
before. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields
with $m_a\approx 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM
with mass $m_X\approx 1\text{ keV}$. The halo model shows that differences
between WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and
fully non-linear regimes. The code uses analytic transfer functions for the
linear power spectrum, modified collapse barriers in the halo mass function,
and a modified concentration-mass relationship for the halo density profiles.
Modified halo density profiles (for example, cores) are not included, but are
under development. Cores are expected to have very minor effects on the power
spectrum on observable scales. Applications of this code to the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest flux power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background lensing power
spectrum will be discussed in companion papers. \textsc{WarmAndFuzzy} is

\textit{spectral} dimension, others refer to the \textit{Hausdorff} dimension
and, very recently, it has been introduced also the \textit{thermal} dimension.
We here show that all these distinct definitions of dimension give the same
outcome in the case of the effective regime of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). This
is achieved by deriving a modified dispersion relation from the
hypersurface-deformation algebra with quantum corrections. Moreover we also
observe that the number of UV dimensions can be used to constrain the
ambiguities in the choice of these LQG-based modifications of the Dirac
spacetime algebra. In this regard, introducing the \textit{polymerization} of

the leading quantum correction gives $d_{UV} = 2.5$. This result may indicate
that the running to the expected value of two dimensions is ongoing, but it has

show here that such heavy tails are due to a universal mechanism related to the
fluctuations of the total force field. Owing to the divergence in 1/r^2 of the
binary interaction force, these fluctuations can be very large and their
probability density exhibits a similar long tail. They induce large velocity
fluctuations leading to the 1/v^(5/2) tail. We extract the mechanism causing
these properties from the BBGKY hierarchy representation of Statistical
Mechanics. This leads to a modification of the Vlasov equation by an additional
term. The novel term involves a fractional power 3/4 of the Laplacian in
velocity space and a fractional iterated time integral. Solving the new kinetic

additional information on the sub-ensemble of tracers that on average disperse
most efficiently in the form of extreme value statistics and flow anisotropy

Applying extreme value theory, we show that the maximal square extensions of
convex hull vertices are well described by a classic extreme value

intermittent convective plumes grow and accelerate the dispersion of Lagrangian

exponential independence number $\alpha_e(G)$ of $G$ as the maximum order of an
exponential independent set of $G$.
  Similarly as for exponential domination, the non-local nature of exponential
independence leads to many interesting effects and challenges. Our results
comprise exact values for special graphs as well as tight bounds and the
corresponding extremal graphs. Furthermore, we characterize all graphs $G$ for
which $\alpha_e(H)$ equals the independence number $\alpha(H)$ for every
induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, and we give an explicit characterization of all
trees $T$ with $\alpha_e(T)=\alpha(T)$.

whether there exist solutions of these types which are free of gradient and

its variants in which the scale factor tends to a constant as $t\to -\infty$.
The result remains valid in theories with additional matter that obeys the Null

and especially supercooled water is that of two-structure thermodynamics, in
which water is viewed as a non-ideal mixture of two interconvertible local
structures. The non-ideality of this mixture may give rise, at very low
temperatures, to a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a liquid-liquid
critical point (LLCP), at which thermodynamic response functions diverge.
Various versions of the ""two-structure equation of state"" (TSEOS) based on this
concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data in real
water and simulation results. However, recent experiments probing supercooled
water at negative pressures reveal the inadequacy of extrapolations of
equations of state developed for positive pressures, and have begun to shed
additional light on the source of the anomalies of supercooled water. We have
analyzed simulation results for the TIP4P/2005 model over a broad range of
positive and negative pressures from ambient temperature to deep supercooling.
We find that by explicitly incorporating a liquid-vapor spinodal into a
two-structure equation of state, we are able to match the simulation data in
TIP4P/2005 with striking accuracy. In particular, our equation of state
reproduces the observed lines of minima and maxima in the density, isothermal
compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. Contrary to scenarios in which a
retracing spinodal accounts for the thermodynamic anomalies of water, we find
that the liquid-vapor spinodal in this model continues monotonically to lower
pressures as temperature is decreased, influencing but not giving rise to the
locus of density maxima and other thermodynamic anomalies. We explain the
behavior of TIP4P/2005 in terms of two phenomena: the competition between two
local structures and a monotonic liquid-vapor spinodal.

of phase change memory property and origins of giant responses of piezoelectric
materials (PbTiO3, BiFeO3). This has important consequences for dynamical
behavior in particular leading to a simultaneous hardening of acoustic modes
and softening of high frequency optic modes in crystalline phase relative to

a direct explanation for different physical properties and understanding of the
combination of long time stability and rapid switching and may be useful in
finding new phase change compositions with superior properties.

lattices, here we show scalable nanostructured semiconductor thin films on
large area nanoimprinted substrates up to 4cm^2 with advanced functional
features of aperiodic composite nanophotonic lattices having tailorable

nanostructured materials with well-defined lattice point morphologies are
designed functionally akin to two-dimensional incommensurate intergrowth
aperiodic lattices-comprising periodic photonic crystals and in-plane
quasicrystals as subgroups. The composite photonic lattice-structured
crystalline silicon thin films with tapered nanoholes or nanocone-nanoholes are
presented showing up to +30 % achievable short circuit current density in
comparison to a periodic counterpart where as it is up to +190 % in comparison
to a reference unstructured silicon thin film of 300 nanometers of thickness.
In view of scalable bottom-up integrated device fabrication processes, the
structural analysis is further extended to liquid phase crystallized
double-side-textured deterministic aperiodic lattice-structured 10 micrometers

processes, such as tissue growth, wound healing and immune response. Even if a
comprehensive understanding of this motility mode remains elusive, progress has
been achieved in its modeling using a whole cell physical model. The model
takes into account the main mechanisms of cell motility - actin polymerization,
substrate mediated adhesion and actin-myosin dynamics and combines it with
steric cell-cell and hydrodynamic interactions. The model predicts the onset of
collective cell migration, which emerges spontaneously as a result of inelastic
collisions of neighboring cells. Each cell here modeled as an active polar gel,
is accomplished with two vortices if it moves. Open collision of two cells the
two vortices which come close to each other annihilate. This leads to a
rotation of the cells and together with the deformation and the reorientation
of the actin filaments in each cell induces alignment of these cells and leads
to persistent translational collective migration. The effect for low Reynolds
numbers is as strong as in the non-hydrodynamic model, but it decreases with
increasing Reynolds number.

the total adoption curve in a predictable way, with peak times which can be,

profilometry and proposes one shot profilometry using iterative two-step
temporal phase-unwrapping by combining the composite fringe projection and the
iterative two-step temporal phase unwrapping algorithm. In temporal phase
unwrapping, many images with different frequency fringe pattern are needed to
project which would take much time. In order to solve this problem, Ochoa
proposed a phase unwrapping algorithm based on phase partitions using a
composite fringe, which only needs projecting one composite fringe pattern with
four kinds of frequency information to complete the process of 3D profilometry.
However, we found that the fringe order determined through the construction of
phase partitions tended to be imprecise. Recently, we proposed an iterative
two-step temporal phase unwrapping algorithm, which can achieve high
sensitivity and high precision shape measurement. But it needs multiple frames
of fringe images which would take much time. In order to take into account both
the speed and accuracy of 3D shape measurement, we get a new, and more accurate
unwrapping method based on composite fringe pattern by combining these two
techniques. This method not only retains the speed advantage of Ochoa's
algorithm, but also greatly improves its measurement accuracy. Finally, the
experimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity of the proposed
method, and the experimental results show that this method is feasible.

for cometary activity focusing on localised emission sources, such as cliffs or
terraced regions. Here we suggest, by correlating high-resolution simulations
of the dust environment around 67P with observations, that the anisotropy and
the background dust density of 67P originate from dust released across the
entire sunlit surface of the nucleus rather than from few isolated sources. We
trace back trajectories from coma regions with high local dust density in space
to the non-spherical nucleus and identify two mechanisms of jet formation:
areas with local concavity in either two dimensions or only one. Pits and
craters are examples of the first case, the neck region of the bilobed nucleus
of 67P for the latter one. The conjunction of multiple sources in addition to
dust released from all other sunlit areas results in a high correlation
coefficient (~0.8) of the predictions with observations during a complete
