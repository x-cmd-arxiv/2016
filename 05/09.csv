fusion and vector boson fusion processes with the Higgs boson decaying into a
W+W- pair and the W bosons decaying leptonically. The data observed in this
analysis are used to constrain the Higgs boson total decay width. The analysis
is based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding
to integrated luminosities of 4.9 inverse femtobarns at a centre-of-mass energy
of 7 TeV and 19.4 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV, respectively. An observed
(expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs boson event yield normalised to
the standard model prediction of 2.4 (6.2) is obtained at the 95% CL for the
gluon fusion process and of 19.3 (34.4) for the vector boson fusion process.
Observed and expected limits on the total width of 26 and 66 MeV are found,
respectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL). These limits are combined with
the previous result in the ZZ channel leading to observed and expected 95% CL
upper limits on the width of 13 and 26 MeV, respectively.

measuring the dependence of random variables with heavy tails. However, the

$\rho$ are studied through two approaches: one from influence function and the
other from U-statistics and the delta method. We compare asymptotic
efficiencies of linear correlation estimators based on the symmetric Gini,
regular Gini, Pearson and Kendall's $\tau$ under various distributions. In
addition to reasonably balancing between robustness and efficiency, the
proposed measure $\rho_g$ demonstrates superior finite sample performance,

space-time complexity or yield unsatisfactory compression rates, leading to
rapid exhaustion of memory, computation, storage and energy resources. Their
ability is commonly limited when operating in a resource-constrained
environment especially when the data volume (even when compressed) far exceeds
the storage limit. Hence we propose a novel online framework for error-bounded
trajectory compression and ageing called the Amnesic Bounded Quadrant System
(ABQS), whose core is the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS) algorithm family that
includes a normal version (BQS), Fast version (FBQS), and a Progressive version
(PBQS). ABQS intelligently manages a given storage and compresses the
trajectories with different error tolerances subject to their ages. In the
experiments, we conduct comprehensive evaluations for the BQS algorithm family
and the ABQS framework. Using empirical GPS traces from flying foxes and cars,
and synthetic data from simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
standalone BQS algorithms in significantly reducing the time and space
complexity of trajectory compression, while greatly improving the compression
rates of the state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 45%). We also show that the
operational time of the target resource-constrained hardware platform can be
prolonged by up to 41%. We then verify that with ABQS, given data volumes that
are far greater than storage space, ABQS is able to achieve 15 to 400 times
smaller errors than the baselines. We also show that the algorithm is robust to
extreme trajectory shapes.

distribution. We discuss the origins and evolution of radial metallicity
gradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical chemical evolution
model. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are
determined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming
ISM, radial changes in the star-formation history (in particular inside-out
formation), and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,
inside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but
contributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the
metallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative
d[Fe/H]/dR in some high redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in
local observations.
  We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive
d[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal
velocity and the metallicity (positive dV_{\phi}/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the
Milky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high central gas-loss
rates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion of enriched material in
conjunction with inside-out formation, and near-disc galactic fountaining. For
the Milky Way thick disc, we show that the positive dV_{\phi}/d[Fe/H]
correlation points to comparable timescales for inside-out formation, initial
metal enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM
metallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the
high-metallicity tail of the alpha enhanced population. Including inside-out
formation in our models changes the local vertical metallicity gradient by
about -0.2dex/kpc, in line with local measurements.

topologically) provided that $(M,g)$ is strongly causal and $\rho$ does not
have what we call weakly ancestral pairs, a notion which admits a natural
interpretation in terms of ""cosmic censorship"". Accordingly, such condition
holds automatically if $(M,g)$ is globally hyperbolic. We also prove that $M$
splits topologically if $(M,g)$ is strongly causal and $\rho$ is the flow of a
complete conformal Killing causal vector field. In the second part, we
investigate the class of Brinkmann spacetimes, which can be regarded as null
analogues of stationary spacetimes in which $\rho$ is the flow of a complete
parallel null vector field. Inspired by the geometric characterization of
stationary spacetimes in terms of standard stationary ones [24], we obtain an
analogous geometric characterization of when a Brinkmann spacetime is isometric

conjectural null analogue for Ricci-flat $4$-dimensional Brinkmann spacetimes

These data pose unique challenges in a variety of operational problems posed as
stochastic optimization problems, including pricing and inventory management,
where one must evaluate the effect of a decision, such as price or order
quantity, on an uncertain cost/reward variable, such as demand, based on
historical data where decision and outcome may be confounded. Often, the data
lacks the features necessary to enable sound assessment of causal effects
and/or the strong assumptions necessary may be dubious. Nonetheless, common
practice is to assign a decision an objective value equal to the best
prediction of cost/reward given the observation of the decision in the data.
While in general settings this identification is spurious, for optimization
purposes it is only the objective value of the final decision that matters,
rather than the validity of any model used to arrive at it. In this paper, we
formalize this statement in the case of observational-data-driven optimization
and study both the power and limits of predictive approaches to
observational-data-driven optimization with a particular focus on pricing. We
provide rigorous bounds on optimality gaps of such approaches even when optimal
decisions cannot be identified from data. To study potential limits of
predictive approaches in real datasets, we develop a new hypothesis test for
causal-effect objective optimality. Applying it to interest-rate-setting data,
we empirically demonstrate that predictive approaches can be powerful in
practice but with some critical limitations.

tackle the count nature of these data by modeling log-count reads per million

inherent heteroscedasticity. Adopting such a framework, we propose tcgsaseq, a
principled, model-free and efficient top-down method for detecting longitudinal

identifies those whose expression vary over time, based on an original variance
component score test accounting for both covariates and heteroscedasticity
without assuming any specific parametric distribution for the transformed

our test statistic has a simple form and limiting distribution, and both may be
computed quickly. A permutation version of the test is additionally proposed
for very small sample sizes. Applied to both simulated data and two real
datasets, the proposed method is shown to exhibit very good statistical
properties, with an increase in stability and power when compared to state of
the art methods ROAST, edgeR and DESeq2, which can fail to control the type I
error under certain realistic settings. We have made the method available for
the community in the R package tcgsaseq.

ordered set is Radix Selection. This algorithm requires the data to be given as
strings of symbols over an ordered alphabet, e.g., binary expansions of real
numbers. Its complexity is measured by the number of symbols that have to be
read. In this paper the model of independent data identically generated from a
Markov chain is considered. The complexity is studied as a stochastic process
indexed by the set of infinite strings over the given alphabet. The orders of
mean and variance of the complexity and, after normalization, a limit theorem
with a centered Gaussian process as limit are derived. This implies an analysis
for two standard models for the ranks: uniformly chosen ranks, also called
grand averages, and the worst case rank complexities which are of interest in
computer science. For uniform data and the asymmetric Bernoulli model (i.e.
memoryless sources), we also find weak convergence for the normalized process
of complexities when indexed by the ranks while for more general Markov sources
these processes are not tight under the standard normalizations.

radiative feedback and powerful outflows. In particular, black hole transients
show outflows whose properties are strongly coupled to those of the accretion
flow. This includes X-ray winds of ionized material, expelled from the
accretion disc encircling the black hole, and collimated radio jets. Very
recently, a distinct optical variability pattern has been reported in the
transient black hole transient V404 Cyg, and interpreted as disrupted mass flow
into the inner regions of its large accretion disc. Here, we report on the
discovery of a sustained outer accretion disc wind in V404 Cyg, which is unlike
any seen previously. We find that the outflowing wind is neutral, has a large
covering factor, expands at 1% of the speed of light and triggers a nebular
phase once accretion sharply drops and the ejecta become optically thin. The
large expelled mass (> 10^-8 Msun) indicates that the outburst was prematurely
ended when a sizeable fraction of the outer disc was depleted by the wind,
detaching the inner regions from the rest of the disc. The luminous, but brief,
accretion phases shown by transients with large accretion discs imply that this
outflow is most likely a new fundamental ingredient regulating mass accretion
onto black holes.

detailed models that account for a complex microphysics including that of
opacities, equation of state and nuclear reactions. The present stellar models
are essentially one-dimensional, namely spherically symmetric. However, the
interpretation of recent data like the surface abundances of elements or the
distribution of internal rotation have reached the limits of validity of
one-dimensional models because of their very simplified representation of
large-scale fluid flows. In this article, we describe the ESTER code, which is
the first code able to compute in a consistent way a two-dimensional model of a
fast rotating star including its large-scale flows. Compared to classical 1D
stellar evolution codes, many numerical innovations have been introduced to
deal with this complex problem. First, the spectral discretization based on
spherical harmonics and Chebyshev polynomials is used to represent the 2D
axisymmetric fields. A nonlinear mapping maps the spheroidal star and allows a
smooth spectral representation of the fields. The properties of Picard and
Newton iterations for solving the nonlinear partial differential equations of
the problem are discussed. It turns out that the Picard scheme is efficient on
the computation of the simple polytropic stars, but Newton algorithm is
unsurpassed when stellar models include complex microphysics. Finally, we
discuss the numerical efficiency of our solver of Newton iterations. This
linear solver combines the iterative Conjugate Gradient Squared algorithm
together with an LU-factorization serving as a preconditionner of the Jacobian

that are comparable or stronger than the $m=2$ mode which is the strongest

might be obtained for the $m=1$ mode and discuss the prospects for observing
this signal with available Earth-based detectors. Because the $m=1$ occurs at
roughly half the frequency of the more powerful $m=2$ signal and because it can
potentially be long-lived, targeted searches could be devised to observe it. We
estimate that with constant amplitude direct detection of the mode could occur
up to a distance of roughly $14\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ whereas a search triggered by
the inspiral signal could extend this distance to roughly $100\,\mathrm{Mpc}$.

which the effective parton propagators have a complex selfenergy that depends
on the temperature $T$ of the medium as well as on the chemical potential
$\mu_q$ and the parton three-momentum ${\boldsymbol p}$ with respect to the

description of QCD thermodynamics with respect to the entropy density, pressure
etc. above the critical temperature $T_c \approx$ 158 MeV. Furthermore, the
quark susceptibility $\chi_q$ and the quark number density $n_q$ are found to
be reproduced simultaneously at zero and finite quark chemical potential. The
shear and bulk viscosities $\eta, \zeta$, and the electric conductivity
$\sigma_e$ from the DQPM$^*$ also turn out in close agreement with lattice
results for $\mu_q$ =0. The DQPM$^*$, furthermore, allows to evaluate the
momentum $p$, $T$ and $\mu_q$ dependencies of the partonic degrees of freedom
also for larger $\mu_q$ which are mandatory for transport studies of heavy-ion
collisions in the regime 5 GeV $< \sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 10 GeV. We finally calculate
the charm quark diffusion coefficient $D_s$ -- evaluated from the differential
cross sections of partons in the medium for light and heavy quarks by employing
the propagators and couplings from the DQPM -- and compare to the available

connect with probability $p$ within a community and $q$ across different

recovers the community memberships of all nodes w.h.p. as long as the number of

not possible if the number of observed labels is less than $n^{1-D(a,b)}$. The

decomposition errors of the particle system for this class of algorithms in the
short and in the long time regime, no study yet explores and quantifies the
loss of time-reversibility in Parallel KMC. Inspired by concepts from
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we propose the entropy production per
unit time, or entropy production rate, given in terms of an observable and a
corresponding estimator, as a metric that quantifies the loss of reversibility.
Typically, this is a quantity that cannot be computed explicitly for Parallel
KMC, which is why we develop a posteriori estimators that have good scaling
properties with respect to the size of the system. Through these estimators, we
can connect the different parameters of the scheme, such as the communication
time step of the parallelization, the choice of the domain decomposition, and
the computational schedule, with its performance in controlling the loss of
reversibility. From this point of view, the entropy production rate can be seen
both as an information criterion to compare the reversibility of different
parallel schemes and as a tool to diagnose reversibility issues with a
particular scheme. As a demonstration, we use Sandia Lab's SPPARKS software to
compare different parallelization schemes and different domain (lattice)
decompositions.

depends on the curvature $\kappa$ of the underlying space as a
deformation/contraction parameter, and the Liouville integrability of
${H}_\kappa$ relies on its separability in terms of geodesic parallel
coordinates, which generalize the Cartesian coordinates of the plane. Moreover,
the system is shown to be superintegrable for commensurate frequencies
$\omega_x: \omega_y$, thus mimicking the behaviour of the flat Euclidean case,
which is always recovered in the $\kappa\to 0$ limit. The additional constant
of motion in the commensurate case is, as expected, of higher-order in the
momenta and can be explicitly deduced by performing the classical factorization
of the Hamiltonian. The known $1:1$ and $2:1$ anisotropic curved oscillators
are recovered as particular cases of ${H}_\kappa$, meanwhile all the remaining
$\omega_x: \omega_y$ curved oscillators define new superintegrable systems.
Furthermore, the quantum Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ is fully constructed and
studied by following a quantum factorization approach. In the case of
commensurate frequencies, the Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ turns out to be
quantum superintegrable and leads to a new exactly solvable quantum model. Its
corresponding spectrum, that exhibits a maximal degeneracy, is explicitly given
as an analytical deformation of the Euclidean eigenvalues in terms of both the

obtained as a composition of two one-dimensional (either trigonometric or

  for wave propagation problems in locally periodic media","29 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns the analysis of a multiscale method for wave propagation
problems in microscopically nonhomogeneous media. A direct numerical
approximation of such problems is prohibitively expensive as it requires
resolving the microscopic variations over a much larger physical domain of
interest. The heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) is an efficient framework
to approximate the solutions of multiscale problems. In HMM, one assumes an
incomplete macroscopic model which is coupled to a known but expensive
microscopic model. The micromodel is solved only locally to upscale the
parameter values which are missing in the macromodel. The resulting macroscopic
model can then be solved at a cost independent of the small scales in the
problem.
  In general, the accuracy of the HMM is related to how good the upscaling step
approximates the right macroscopic quantities. The analysis of the method, that
we consider here, was previously addressed only in purely periodic media
although the method itself is numerically shown to be applicable to more
general settings. In the present study, we consider a more realistic setting by
assuming a locally-periodic medium where slow and fast variations are allowed
at the same time. We then prove that HMM captures the right macroscopic
effects. The generality of the tools and ideas in the analysis allows us to
establish convergence rates in a multi-dimensional setting. The theoretical
findings here imply an improved convergence rate in one-dimension, which also

apparent magnetic moment fragmentation, within the framework of a quantum model
of nearest-neighbor exchange, appropriate to Nd2Zr2O7. This model is able to
capture both the ground-state order and the pinch points observed at finite

we present an Energy Driven Architecture (EDA) as a new architecture for
minimising the total energy consumption of WSNs. EDA as a constituent-based
architecture is used to deploy WSNs according to energy dissipation through
their constituents. This view of overall energy consumption in WSNs can be
applied to optimising and balancing energy consumption and increasing the
network lifetime. Refer back to the architecture, we introduce a single overall
model and propose a feasible formulation to express the overall energy
consumption of a generic wireless sensor network application in terms of its
energy constituents. The formulation offers a concrete expression for
evaluating the performance of WSN application, optimising its constituents
operations, and designing more energy-efficient applications. The ultimate aim
is to produce an energy map architecture of a generic WSN application that
comprises essential and definable energy constituents and the relationships
between these constituents to explore strategies for minimising the overall
energy consumption of the application. Later, parameters affecting energy in
WSNs are extracted. The dependency between these parameters and the average
energy consumption of an application is then investigated. A few statistical
tools are applied for parameter reduction followed by random forest regression
to model energy consumption per delivered packet with and without parameter
reduction to determine the reduction in accuracy due to reduction. Finally, an
energy-efficient dynamic topology management algorithm is proposed based on the

extended GN system is then explored in detail. In particular, we use its
characteristics to discuss the well-posedness of the linearized problem. As
illustrative examples of approximate model equations, we derive a higher-order
model that is accurate to the fourth power of the dispersion parameter in the
case of a flat bottom topography, and address the related issues such as the
linear dispersion relation, conservation laws and the pressure distribution at
the fluid bottom on the basis of this model. The original GN model is then
briefly described in the case of an uneven bottom topography. Subsequently, the

also to determine its mass hierarchy, since the massive neutrino contributes to
the total matter density in the Universe at the background and perturbation
levels, once it becomes non-relativistic. After the non-relativistic transition
the fluctuations are smashed out at the scales $k\gg k_{fs}$. Therefore, the
missing fluctuation in the total matter is imprinted on the large scale
structure, say the suppression of the matter power spectrum $\Delta P/P\approx
-8f_{\nu}$ at the scales $k\gg k_{fs}$. In this paper, instead of considering
the linear perturbation theory, which is well understood in the presence of
neutrino, we propose to use the cross correlation between the Rees-Sciama
effect and weak lensing to probe the neutrino mass. At the small scales, the
density contrast grows faster than the background scale factor $\delta\sim a$,
that makes a sign flipping on $\Phi' \propto \mathcal{H}\delta d\ln
(\delta/a)/d\ln a$, which happens only in the non-linear regime. We show that
the flipping scale in the cross power spectrum between the Rees-Sciama effect
and weak lensing depends on the neutrino mass by assuming the shallow and deep
weak lensing surveys. Our analysis shows that the Deep survey has larger
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N\sim 160$. Finally, we use the Fisher information

\Gamma-point in Brillouin zone, so that there are no ""nesting"" properties of
different Fermi surface pockets. LDA+DMFT calculations show that correlation
effects on Fe-3d states in the single FeSe layer are not that strong as in most
of FeAs systems. As a result, at present there is no theoretical understanding
of the formation of rather ""shallow"" electronic bands at M points. LDA
calculations show that the main difference in electronic structure of FeSe
monolayer on SrTiO_3 substrate from isolated FeSe layer is the presence of the
band of O-2p surface states of TiO_2 layer on the Fermi level together with
Fe-3d states, which may be important for understanding the enhanced T_c values
in this system. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for
microscopic models of superconductivity.

environment of the Galactic Center (GC) a few million years ago, have been
excellent targets for studying the effects of a star-forming environment on the
initial mass function (IMF). In order to estimate the shape of the low-end IMF
of the Arches cluster, Shin & Kim devised a novel photometric method that
utilizes pixel intensity histograms (PIHs) of the observed images. Here, we
apply the PIH method to the Quintuplet cluster and estimate the shape of its
low-end IMF below the magnitude of completeness limit as set by conventional
photometry. We found that the low-end IMF of the Quintuplet is consistent with
that found for the Arches cluster--Kroupa MF, with a significant number of
low-mass stars below 1 $M_{\odot}$. We conclude that the most likely IMFs of
the Quintuplet and the Arches clusters are not too different from the IMFs
found in the Galactic disc. We also find that the observed PIHs and stellar
number density profiles of both clusters are best reproduced when the clusters
are assumed to be at three-dimensional distances of approximately 100 pc from
the GC.

  Real-Time Application",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grid mapping is a well established approach for environment perception in
robotic and automotive applications. Early work suggests estimating the
occupancy state of each grid cell in a robot's environment using a Bayesian
filter to recursively combine new measurements with the current posterior state
estimate of each grid cell. This filter is often referred to as binary Bayes
filter (BBF). A basic assumption of classical occupancy grid maps is a
stationary environment. Recent publications describe bottom-up approaches using
particles to represent the dynamic state of a grid cell and outline
prediction-update recursions in a heuristic manner. This paper defines the
state of multiple grid cells as a random finite set, which allows to model the
environment as a stochastic, dynamic system with multiple obstacles, observed
by a stochastic measurement system. It motivates an original filter called the
probability hypothesis density / multi-instance Bernoulli (PHD/MIB) filter in a
top-down manner. The paper presents a real-time application serving as a fusion
layer for laser and radar sensor data and describes in detail a highly
efficient parallel particle filter implementation. A quantitative evaluation
shows that parameters of the stochastic process model affect the filter results
as theoretically expected and that appropriate process and observation models
provide consistent state estimation results.

show that the compositeness relation can still provide a reasonable constraint
on the wavefunction renormalization parameter due to the dominance of the
molecular component. Such a mechanism can be regarded as a natural consequence
of the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) breaking. This study elaborates the
molecular picture for the $Y(4260)$ in the $e^+e^-$ annihilations and affirms
that the cross section lineshape of $e^+e^-\to \bar{D}D^*\pi+c.c.$ in the

we predict that the upper limit of the $Y(4260)$ leptonic decay width is about

much of statistics, business, science and engineering, but they are not yet
widely recognized as a technology in the sense of scalability. A reason for
this relatively low degree of popularity is the lack of a well developed system
of theory and algorithms to support the applications, as is the case for its
convex counterpart. This paper aims to take one step in the direction of
disciplined nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. In particular, we consider in
this paper some constrained nonconvex optimization models in block decision
variables, with or without coupled affine constraints. In the case of without
coupled constraints, we show a sublinear rate of convergence to an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution in the form of variational inequality for a
generalized conditional gradient method, where the convergence rate is shown to
be dependent on the H\""olderian continuity of the gradient of the smooth part
of the objective. For the model with coupled affine constraints, we introduce
corresponding $\epsilon$-stationarity conditions, and apply two proximal-type
variants of the ADMM to solve such a model, assuming the proximal ADMM updates
can be implemented for all the block variables except for the last block, for
which either a gradient step or a majorization-minimization step is
implemented. We show an iteration complexity bound of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
reach an $\epsilon$-stationary solution for both algorithms. Moreover, we show
that the same iteration complexity of a proximal BCD method follows
immediately. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the
proposed algorithms for tensor robust PCA.

is included in the SVM (e.g., Shephard (2005)), then the expected log-return at
time t conditional on the past returns is non-zero, which is not a desirable

harmful traps, we show that the electronic activities of defects in 2D

orientation, one can change the synthesis conditions to convert a line defect
(edge or grain boundary) from electron acceptor to inactive site without deep
gap states. We show that this difference originates from the enhanced ionic
bonding in these perovskites compared with MX2. The donors tend to have high

halide chemical potential. Thus we unveil unique properties of defects in 2D
perovskites and suggest practical routes to improve them.

program designed to search for transiting exoplanets orbiting relatively bright
stars. To achieve this, the KELT Science Team operates two planets facilities -
KELT-North, at Winer Observatory, Arizona, and KELT-South, at the South African
Astronomical Observatory. The telescopes used at these observatories have
particularly wide fields of view, allowing KELT to study a large number of
potential exoplanet host stars. One of the major advantages of targeting bright
stars is that the exoplanet candidates detected can be easily followed up by
small, ground-based observatories distributed around the world. This paper will
provide a brief overview of the KELT-North and the KELT-South surveys, the
follow-up observations preformed by the KELT Follow-up Collaboration, and
exoplanet discoveries confirmed thus far, before concluding with a brief
discussion of the future for the KELT program.

to radio frequencies. Hence, combs allow to measure optical frequencies with
respect to a radio frequency where the accuracy is limited only by the
reference signal. In order to provide a stable link between the radio and
optical frequencies, the two parameters of the frequency comb must be fixed:
the carrier envelope offset frequency $f_{\rm ceo}$ and the pulse
repetition-rate $f_{\rm rep}$. We have developed the first optical frequency
comb based on difference frequency generation (DFG) that eliminates $f_{\rm
ceo}$ by design - specifically tailored for applications in cold atom physics.
An $f_{\rm ceo}$-free spectrum at 1550 nm is generated from a super continuum
spanning more than an optical octave. Established amplification and frequency
conversion techniques based on reliable telecom fiber technology allow
generation of multiple wavelength outputs. In this paper we discuss the
frequency comb design, characterization, and optical frequency measurement of
Sr Rydberg states. The DFG technique allows for a compact and robust, passively
$f_{\rm ceo}$ stable frequency comb significantly improving reliability in
practical applications.

Service Level Agreements (SLA), and SLA-compliance monitoring have typically
been used in separate and disparate ways, which affect the quality of the

broker-based framework to deal with these concerns in an integrated manner for
Software as a Service (SaaS) provisioning. The SaaS Broker selects a suitable
SaaS provider on behalf of the service consumer by using a utility-driven
selection algorithm that ranks the QoS offerings of potential SaaS providers.
Then, it negotiates the SLA terms with that provider based on the quality
requirements of the service consumer. The monitoring infrastructure observes
SLA-compliance during service delivery by using measurements obtained from
third-party monitoring services. We also define a utility-based bargaining
decision model that allows the service consumer to express her sensitivity for
each of the negotiated quality attributes and to evaluate the SaaS provider
offer in each round of negotiation. A use-case with few quality attributes and
their respective utility functions illustrates the approach.

to horizontal ($x$-$y$) averaging, we demonstrate the presence of large scale
fields when either horizontal or vertical ($y$-$z$) averaging is employed. By
computing planar averaged fields and power spectra, we find large scale dynamo
action in the early MRI growth phase---a previously unidentified feature. Fast
growing horizontal low modes and fiducial vertical modes over a narrow range of
wave numbers amplify these planar averaged fields in the MRI growth phase,
before turbulence sets in. The large scale field growth requires linear
fluctuations but not nonlinear turbulence (as defined by mode-mode coupling)
and grows as a direct global mode of the MRI. Only by vertical averaging, can
it be shown that the growth of horizontal low wavenumber MRI modes directly
feed-back to the initial vertical field providing a clue as to why the large
scale vertical field sustains against turbulent diffusion in the saturation
regime. We compute the terms in the planar averaged mean field equations to
identify the individual contributions to large scale field growth for both
vertical and horizontal averaging. The large scale fields obtained from such
vertical averaging are found to compare well with global cylindrical
simulations and quasilinear analytical analysis from a previous study by
Ebrahimi \& Blackman. We discuss the potential implications of these new
results for understanding large scale MRI dynamo saturation and turbulence.

have been recently discussed in the context of 'single-photon superradiance',
or cooperative scattering in the linear-optics regime, can also be explained by
'standard optics', i.e., using macroscopic quantities such as the
susceptibility or the diffusion coefficient. We explain why some collective
effects depend on the atomic density, and others on the optical depth. In
particular, we show that, for a large and dilute atomic sample driven by a
far-detuned laser, the decay of the fluorescence, which exhibits superradiant
and subradiant dynamics, depends only on the on-resonance optical depth. We
also discuss the link between concepts that are independently studied in the
quantum-optics community and in the mesoscopic-physics community. We show that
the coupled-dipole model predicts a departure from Ohm's law for the diffuse
light, that incoherent multiple scattering can induce a saturation of
fluorescence and we also show the similarity between the weak-localization
correction to the diffusion coefficient and the inaccuracy of Lorentz local
field correction to the susceptibility.

outcomes, that is the consistency index is computed for each decision maker,

  of unevenly distributed data",,,"10.1007/s11222-016-9666-x",,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) combine a B-spline basis with a
discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank
spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very
popular as reduced rank smoothers: i) the basis and the penalty are sparse,
enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation;
ii) it is possible to flexibly `mix-and-match' the order of B-spline basis and
penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as
in spline smoothing; iii) it is very easy to set up the B-spline basis
functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable
in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline
penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline
penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of
P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis
functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving
derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may
not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the
three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease
of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based
penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather
than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off
disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based
penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity

super-Eddington luminosities prior to their final explosions. This behavior is
common among Type IIn SNe, but the driving mechanisms of these precursors are
not yet well understood. SNHunt 275 was announced as a possible new SN during
May 2015. Here we report on pre-explosion observations of the location of this

precursor about 500 days prior to the 2015 May activity (PTF 13efv). The
observed velocities in the 2015 transient and its 2013 precursor absorption
spectra are low (1000-2000 km/s), so it is not clear yet if the recent activity
indeed marks the final disruption of the progenitor. Regardless of the nature
of this event, we use the PTF photometric and spectral observations, as well as
Swift-UVOT observations, to constrain the efficiency of the radiated energy
relative to the total kinetic energy of the precursor. We find that, using an

fractional distillation of hydrocarbons based on molecular weight, a technique
of fractional segregation, depending on the channel wettability of polymeric

is suggested. Depending on the properties of the polymeric chains and the
surface chemistry, the segregation of the polymer at a particular level in the

standard operating range, corresponding to half of an interference fringe. We
report atom-based acceleration measurements along both the horizontal and
vertical axes of the aircraft with one-shot sensitivities of $2.3 \times
10^{-4}\,g$ over a range of $\sim 0.1\,g$. The same technology can be used to
develop cold-atom gyroscopes, which could surpass the best optical gyroscopes
in terms of long-term sensitivity. Our apparatus was also designed to study
multi-axis atom interferometry with the goal of realizing a full inertial
measurement unit comprised of the three axes of acceleration and rotation.

essential part of any cold-atom-based sensor. The architecture of the laser is

stochastic passive advection-diffusion of a scalar with external forcing. The
model for the phase coupling dynamics follows the well known Kuramoto model
paradigm of limit-cycle oscillators. The natural frequencies in the Kuramoto
model are assumed to obey a given scale dependence through a dispersion
relation of the drift-wave form $-\beta\frac{k}{1+k^2}$, where $\beta$ is a
constant representing the typical strength of the gradient. The present aim is
to study the importance of collective phase dynamics on the characteristic time
evolution of the fluctuation energy and the formation of coherent structures.
Our results show that the assumption of a fully stochastic phase state of
turbulence is more relevant for high values of $\beta$, where we find that the
energy spectrum follows a $k^{-7/2}$ scaling. Whereas for lower $\beta$ there
is a significant difference between a-synchronised and synchronised phase
states, and one could expect the formation of coherent modulations in the
latter case.

using the Eulerian partial differential equation (PDE) approach. We
investigated the effect of the inhomogeneity of magnetic field strength and
statistical noise on the accuracy of our automatic volumetry and the PDE
approach using the simulated MR images generated from BrainWeb. Our automatic
volumetry and PDE approach were robust against inhomogeneous magnetic field
strength. Although the accuracy of our automatic volumetry decreased with
increasing statistical noise, it was maintained when the statistical noise was
less than 7-8%. The cortical thickness obtained by the PDE method tended to
decrease with increasing statistical noise. When we applied our method to
clinical data, the cortical thinning due to brain atrophy was clearly
demonstrated in patients with brain atrophy. These results suggest that our
system appears to be useful for the diagnosis of AD, because it allows us to
automatically evaluate the extent of brain atrophy and cortical thinning in a

  X-ray study","Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 17 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1033",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we report the results of an X-ray monitoring campaign on the
heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy Markarian 3 carried out between the fall of
2014 and the spring of 2015 with NuSTAR, Suzaku and XMM-Newton. The hard X-ray
spectrum of Markarian 3 is variable on all the time scales probed by our
campaign, down to a few days. The observed continuum variability is due to an
intrinsically variable primary continuum seen in transmission through a large,
but still Compton-thin column density (N_H~0.8-1.1$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$).
If arranged in a spherical-toroidal geometry, the Compton scattering matter has
an opening angle ~66 degrees and is seen at a grazing angle through its upper
rim (inclination angle ~70 degrees). We report a possible occultation event
during the 2014 campaign. If the torus is constituted by a system of clouds
sharing the same column density, this event allows us to constrain their number
(17$\pm$5) and individual column density, [~(4.9$\pm$1.5)$\times$10$^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$]. The comparison of IR and X-ray spectroscopic results with
state-of-the art ""torus"" models suggests that at least two thirds of the X-ray
obscuring gas volume might be located within the dust sublimation radius. We
report also the discovery of an ionized absorber, characterised by variable
resonant absorption lines due to He- and H-like iron. This discovery lends
support to the idea that moderate column density absorbers could be due to
clouds evaporated at the outer surface of the torus, possibly accelerated by
the radiation pressure due to the central AGN emission leaking through the
patchy absorber.

led to suggest that an additional planet should reside in the Solar System.
According to recent models, the secular action of this body should cause
orbital alignment of the KBOs. It was recently claimed that the KBOs concerned
by this dynamics are presumably trapped in mean motion resonances with the
suspected planet. I reinvestigate here the secular model underlying this idea.
The original analysis was done expanding and truncating the secular
Hamiltonian. I show that this is inappropriate here, as the series expansion is
not convergent. I present a study based on numerical computation of the
Hamiltonian with no expansion. I show in phase-space diagrams the existence of
apsidally anti-aligned, high eccentricity libration islands that were not
present in the original modelling, but that match numerical simulations. These
island were claimed to correspond to bodies trapped in mean-motion resonances
with the hypothetical planet, and match the characteristics of the distant KBOs
observed. My main result is that regular secular dynamics can account for the
anti-aligned particles itself as well as mean-motion resonances. I also perform
a semi-analytical study of resonant motion and show that some resonance are
actually capable of producing the same libration islands. I discuss then the
relative importance of both mechanisms.

plagues numerical studies of strongly interacting electron systems. Only
recently, it has been suggested that fermion signs are fundamental for the
universal behavior of critical metallic systems and crucially enhance their
degree of quantum entanglement. In this work we explore potential connections
between emergent scale invariance of fermion sign structures and scaling
properties of bipartite entanglement entropies. Our analysis is based on a
wavefunction ansatz that incorporates collective, long-range backflow
correlations into fermionic Slater determinants. Such wavefunctions mimic the
collapse of a Fermi liquid at a quantum critical point. Their nodal surfaces --
a representation of the fermion sign structure in many-particle configurations
space -- show fractal behavior up to a length scale $\xi$ that diverges at a
critical backflow strength. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal
nodal surface depends on $\xi$, the number of fermions and the exponent of the
backflow. For the same wavefunctions we numerically calculate the second
R\'enyi entanglement entropy $S_2$. Our results show a cross-over from volume
scaling, $S_2\sim \ell^\theta$ ($\theta=2$ in $d=2$ dimensions), to the
characteristic Fermi-liquid behavior $S_2\sim \ell\ln \ell$ on scales larger
than $\xi$. We find that volume scaling of the entanglement entropy is a robust
feature of critical backflow fermions, independent of the backflow exponent and
hence the fractal dimension of the scale invariant sign structure.

by changing the wettability of the surface (characterized by the static contact

the presence of surface roughness always reduces the slip length and it is
proposed that the slip length varies with non-dimensionalized average surface
roughness as $(1+\alpha^*)^{-2}$ . Thus a relation between the chemical
wettability and the physical roughness is established and their coupled

experimental investigation. Here we combine angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and theoretical calculations based on a realistic multi-orbital
model to unveil the microscopic mechanism responsible for the evolution of the
electronic structure of FeSe across the nematic transition. We show that the
self-energy corrections due to the exchange of spin fluctuations between hole

Fermi Surface that affects mainly the $xz/yz$ parts of the Fermi surface. This
result is consistent with our experimental observation of the Fermi Surface in
the high-temperature tetragonal phase, that includes the $xy$ electron sheet
that was not clearly resolved before. In the low-temperature nematic phase, we
experimentally confirm the appearance of a large ($\sim$ 50meV) $xz/yz$

stars, which could be either single WR stars or lower-mass stars stripped of
their envelope by a companion. Their light curves are radioactively powered and
usually show a fast rise to peak ($\sim$10-15 d), without any early (first few
days) emission bumps (with the exception of broad-lined SNe Ic) as sometimes
seen for other types of stripped-envelope SNe (e.g., Type IIb SN 1993J and Type
Ib SN 2008D). We have studied iPTF15dtg, a spectroscopically normal SN Ic with
an early excess in the optical light curves followed by a long ($\sim$30 d)
rise to the main peak. It is the first spectroscopically-normal double-peaked
SN Ic observed. We aim to determine the properties of this explosion and of its
progenitor star. Optical photometry and spectroscopy of iPTF15dtg was obtained
with multiple telescopes. The resulting light curves and spectral sequence are
analyzed and modelled with hydrodynamical and analytical models, with
particular focus on the early emission. Results. iPTF15dtg is a slow rising SN
Ic, similar to SN 2011bm. Hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric properties
reveals a large ejecta mass ($\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$) and strong $^{56}$Ni mixing.
The luminous early emission can be reproduced if we account for the presence of
an extended ($\sim$500 R$_{\odot}$), low-mass ($\sim$0.045 M$_{\odot}$)
envelope around the progenitor star. Alternative scenarios for the early peak,
such as the interaction with a companion, a shock-breakout (SBO) cooling tail
from the progenitor surface, or a magnetar-driven SBO are not favored. The
large ejecta mass and the presence of H and He free extended material around
the star suggest that the progenitor of iPTF15dtg was a massive ($\gtrsim$ 35
M$_{\odot}$) WR star suffering strong mass loss.

find suitable discrete encoding spaces for both cases, and prove that they are

different from the standard Wilson-type U(1) gauge-Higgs model because it has
plaquette and Higgs interactions with asymmetric couplings in the space-time
directions. Nevertheless, the corresponding quantum simulation is still
important as it provides us with a platform to study unexplored time-dependent

determine the phase diagram of the gauge-Higgs model at zero temperature, we
perform Monte-Carlo simulations of the corresponding 3+1-dimensional U(1)

the dynamical properties of the gauge-Higgs model, we apply the

time-evolution of an electric flux that initially is put on a straight line

phenomena observed for the transiting hot Jupiters WASP-12b and HD 189733b in
their ultraviolet (UV) light curves. In the proposed scenario, material
outgasses from the molten surface of Trojan satellites on tadpole orbits near
the Lagrange points L$_4$ and L$_5$. We show that the temperature at the
orbital location of WASP-12b is high enough to melt the surface of rocky bodies
and to form shallow lava oceans on them. In case of WASP-12b, this leads to the
release of elements such as Mg and Ca, which are expected to surround the
system. The predicted Mg and Ca outgassing rates from two Io-sized WASP-12b
Trojans are $\approx 2.2 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\approx 2.2 \times
10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. Trojan outgassing can lead to the apparent
lack of emission in Mg{\sc ii}\,h\&k and Ca{\sc ii}\,H\&K line cores of
WASP-12. For HD 189733b, the mechanism is only marginally possible due to the
lower temperature. This may be one of the reasons that couldn't explain the
early ingress of HD 189733b observed in the far-UV (FUV) C{\sc ii} doublet due
to absence of carbon within elements outgassed by molten lava. We investigate
the long-term stability region of WASP-12b and HD 189733b in case of planar and
inclined motion of these satellites and show that unlike the classical exomoons
orbiting the planet, Io-sized Trojans can be stable for the whole systems life
time.

parameters $P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\,bn+\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ for $a,b >-1$ and
$\lambda\in(0,\,1)$. This is a well-studied topic in the literature but some of
the published results appear to be discordant. To address this issue we provide
an in-depth investigation of the case $b = 0$, which is most relevant for our
applications. Our approach is based on a new and surprisingly simple
representation of $P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2}),\:a>-1$ in terms
of two integrals. The integrals' asymptotic behavior is studied using standard
tools of asymptotic analysis: one is a Laplace integral and the other is
treated via the method of stationary phase. As a consequence we prove that if
$a\in(\frac{2\lambda}{1-\lambda},\infty)$ then
$\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ shows exponential decay
and we derive simple exponential upper bounds in this region. If
$a\in(\frac{-2\lambda}{1+\lambda},\,\frac{2\lambda}{1-\lambda})$ then the decay
of $\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ is
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and if
$a\in\{\frac{-2\lambda}{1+\lambda},\,\frac{2\lambda}{1-\lambda}\}$ then
$\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ decays as
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/3})$. A new phenomenon occurs in the parameter range
$a\in(-1,\frac{-2\lambda}{1+\lambda})$, where we find that the behavior depends
on whether or not $an+\alpha$ is an integer: If
$a\in(-1,\frac{-2\lambda}{1+\lambda})$ and $an+\alpha$ is an integer then
$\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ decays exponentially.
If $a\in(-1,\frac{-2\lambda}{1+\lambda})$ and $an+\alpha$ is not an integer
then $\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\alpha,\beta)}(1-2\lambda^{2})$ may increase
exponentially depending on the proximity of the sequence $(an + \alpha)_n$ to
integers.

provide sharp upper bounds on the degree of the critical locus which depend

Hence, in some special cases where the degrees of the generic polar varieties

amount and profile of hydrogen in thin layers of material. Usually, this tool
requires the use of a standard of well-known composition. The present work, by
contrast, deals with standard-less hydrogen depth profiling. This approach
requires precise nuclear data, e.g. on the widely used
$^{1}$H($^{15}$N,$\alpha\gamma$)$^{12}$C reaction, resonant at 6.4\,MeV
$^{15}$N beam energy. Here, the strongly anisotropic angular distribution of
the emitted $\gamma$-rays from this resonance has been re-measured, resolving a
previous discrepancy. Coefficients of (0.38$\pm$0.04) and (0.80$\pm$0.04) have
been deduced for the second and fourth order Legendre polynomials,
respectively. In addition, the resonance strength has been re-evaluated to
(25.0$\pm$1.5)\,eV, 10\% higher than previously reported. A simple working
formula for the hydrogen concentration is given for cases with known
$\gamma$-ray detection efficiency. Finally, the absolute approach is
illustrated using two examples.

there is no restriction on the size of the linear coupling between two

were able to do so by augmenting standard search methods with a path-tracing

time-optimal control problems, as well as confirming the highly challenging

traffic inside a station by controlling its active elements such as the signals
or points. Modern interlockings are configured using particular data, called
application data, reflecting the track layout and defining the actions that the
interlocking can take. The safety of the train traffic relies thereby on
application data correctness, errors inside them can cause safety issues such
as derailments or collisions. Given the high level of safety required by such a
system, its verification is a critical concern. In addition to the safety, an
interlocking must also ensure that availability properties, stating that no
train would be stopped forever in a station, are satisfied. Most of the
research dealing with this verification relies on model checking. However, due
to the state space explosion problem, this approach does not scale for large
stations. More recently, a discrete event simulation approach limiting the
verification to a set of likely scenarios, was proposed. The simulation enables
the verification of larger stations, but with no proof that all the interesting
scenarios are covered by the simulation. In this paper, we apply an
intermediate statistical model checking approach, offering both the advantages
of model checking and simulation. Even if exhaustiveness is not obtained,
statistical model checking evaluates with a parametrizable confidence the
reliability and the availability of the entire system.

  Dimension Graphs","A preliminary version appeared at the 42nd International Colloquium
  on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2015)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the $k$-Center problem and some generalizations. For $k$-Center a
set of $k$ center vertices needs to be found in a graph $G$ with edge lengths,
such that the distance from any vertex of $G$ to its nearest center is
minimized. This problem naturally occurs in transportation networks, and
therefore we model the inputs as graphs with bounded highway dimension, as
proposed by Abraham et al. [SODA 2010].
  We show both approximation and fixed-parameter hardness results, and how to
overcome them using fixed-parameter approximations, where the two paradigms are
combined. In particular, we prove that for any $\varepsilon>0$ computing a
$(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation is W[2]-hard for parameter $k$ and NP-hard for
graphs with highway dimension $O(\log^2 n)$. The latter does not rule out
fixed-parameter $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximations for the highway dimension
parameter $h$, but implies that such an algorithm must have at least doubly
exponential running time in $h$ if it exists, unless the ETH fails. On the
positive side, we show how to get below the approximation factor of $2$ by
combining the parameters $k$ and $h$: we develop a fixed-parameter
$3/2$-approximation with running time $2^{O(kh\log h)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$.
Additionally we prove that, unless P=NP, our techniques cannot be used to
compute fixed-parameter $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximations for only the parameter
$h$.
  We also provide similar fixed-parameter approximations for the weighted
$k$-Center and $(k,\mathcal{F})$-Partition problems, which generalize
$k$-Center.

estimate the distributions of the sources. A standard approach to this problem
is to model the data as a hidden Markov model (HMM). However, since the data
often lacks the Markov or the stationarity properties of an HMM, one can ask
whether this approach is still suitable or perhaps another approach is
required. In this paper we show that a maximum likelihood HMM estimator can be
used to approximate the source distributions in a much larger class of models
than HMMs. Specifically, we propose a natural and fairly general non-stationary
model of the data, where the only restriction is that the sources do not change
too often. Our main result shows that for this model, a maximum-likelihood HMM
estimator produces the correct second moment of the data, and the results can
be extended to higher moments.

external numbers gave rise to the so-called solids, which are extensions of

  Backhaul-Limited Dense Wireless Networks?","14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",,"10.1109/TNET.2016.2569420",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dense wireless networks are a promising solution to meet the huge capacity
demand in 5G wireless systems. However, there are two implementation issues,
namely the interference and backhaul issues. To resolve these issues, we
propose a novel network architecture called the backhaul-limited cached dense
wireless network (C-DWN), where a physical layer (PHY) caching scheme is
employed at the base stations (BSs) but only a fraction of the BSs have wired
payload backhauls. The PHY caching can replace the role of wired backhauls to
achieve both the cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain and cache-assisted
Multihopping gain. Two fundamental questions are addressed. Can we exploit the
PHY caching to achieve linear capacity scaling with limited payload backhauls?
If so, how much cache is needed? We show that the capacity of the
backhaul-limited C-DWN indeed scales linearly with the number of BSs if the BS
cache size is larger than a threshold that depends on the content popularity.
We also quantify the throughput gain due to cache-induced MIMO cooperation over
conventional caching schemes (which exploit purely the cached-assisted
multihopping). Interestingly, the minimum BS cache size needed to achieve a
significant cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain is the same as that needed to
achieve the linear capacity scaling.

the 5d Chern-Simons term, which introduces a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly to the
dual CFT. The theory trivially satisfies an entanglement first law. However, to
quadratic order in perturbations of the stress tensor $T$ and current density
$J$, there is a mixed contribution to the relative entropy bi-linear in $T$ and
$J$, signalling a potential violation of the positivity of the relative
entropy. Miraculously, the term vanishes up to linear order in a derivative
expansion. This prompted a closer inspection on a different consistency check,
that involves time-delay of a graviton propagating in a charged background,
scattered via a coupling supplied by the Chern-Simons term. The analysis
suggests that the time-delay can take either sign, potentially violating
causality for any finite value of the CS coupling.

vivo at 7T.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Motion is a crucial issue for ultra-high
resolution imaging, such as can be achieved with 7T MRI. An acquisition
protocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7T. It relies
on a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion.
In order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full slab
covering the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition
time. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired
slabs within a final 3D-consistent high-resolution slab covering the whole
hippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three
groups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on
three issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion
artifacts and registration procedure performance.RESULTS:Overall, T2-weighted
acquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration
yielded high quality datasets in 96 % of the subjects, thus compatible with
further analyses of hippocampal inner structure.CONCLUSION:Multi-slab
acquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time
and consequently motion artifacts for ultra-high resolution imaging of the
inner structure of the hippocampus.

  Neuroimaging (PRNI)",,,,"stat.AP cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Men and women differ in specific cognitive abilities and in the expression of
several neuropsychiatric conditions. Such findings could be attributed to sex
hormones, brain differences, as well as a number of environmental variables.
Existing research on identifying sex-related differences in brain structure
have predominantly used cross-sectional studies to investigate, for instance,
differences in average gray matter volumes (GMVs). In this article we explore
the potential of a recently proposed multi-view matrix factorisation (MVMF)
methodology to study structural brain changes in men and women that occur from
adolescence to adulthood. MVMF is a multivariate variance decomposition
technique that extends principal component analysis to ""multi-view"" datasets,
i.e. where multiple and related groups of observations are available. In this
application, each view represents a different age group. MVMF identifies latent
factors explaining shared and age-specific contributions to the observed
overall variability in GMVs over time. These latent factors can be used to
produce low-dimensional visualisations of the data that emphasise age-specific
effects once the shared effects have been accounted for. The analysis of two
datasets consisting of individuals born prematurely as well as healthy controls
provides evidence to suggest that the separation between males and females
becomes increasingly larger as the brain transitions from adolescence to
adulthood. We report on specific brain regions associated to these variance
effects.

regions and is thought to be a precursor for different prebiotic molecules. Its
formation mechanism is still debated, however. Observations of formamide,
related species and their isopotologues may provide useful clues to the
chemical pathways leading to their formation. The Protostellar Interferometric
Line Survey (PILS) represents an unbiased high angular resolution and
sensitivity spectral survey of the low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422

first time the three singly deuterated forms of NH$_2$CHO (NH$_2$CDO, cis- and
trans-NHDCHO) as well as DNCO towards the component B of this binary source.
The images reveal that the different isotopologues are all present in the same
region. Based on observations of the $^{13}$C isotopologues of formamide and a
standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio, the deuterium fractionation is found to be
similar for the three different forms with a value of about 2%. The DNCO/HNCO
ratio is also comparable to the D/H ratio of formamide ($\sim$1%). These
results are in agreement with the hypothesis that NH$_2$CHO and HNCO are
chemically related through grain surface formation.

Essentially, we consider two different cases where the tail behavior either
stems from the i.i.d. innovations of the process or from its volatility
sequence. In both cases, we make use of a large deviations technique for
regularly varying time series to derive multivariate $\alpha$-stable limit
distributions of the sample covariance matrix. While we show that in the case
of heavy-tailed innovations the limiting behavior resembles that of completely

volatility sequence the possible limiting behavior is more diverse, i.e.
allowing for dependencies in the limiting distributions which are determined by
the structure of the underlying volatility sequence.

underlying graph's structure (e.g., as encoded in the Laplacian matrix) to
process signals on the graph. Therefore, in the case when no graph is
available, graph signal processing tools cannot be used anymore. Researchers
have proposed approaches to infer a graph topology from observations of signals
on its nodes. Since the problem is ill-posed, these approaches make
assumptions, such as smoothness of the signals on the graph, or sparsity
priors. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the space of valid
graphs, in the sense that they can explain stationary signals. To simplify the
exposition in this paper, we focus here on the case where signals were i.i.d.
at some point back in time and were observed after diffusion on a graph. We
show that the set of graphs verifying this assumption has a strong connection
with the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and forms a convex set. Along
with a theoretical study in which these eigenvectors are assumed to be known,
we consider the practical case when the observations are noisy, and
experimentally observe how fast the set of valid graphs converges to the set
obtained when the exact eigenvectors are known, as the number of observations

we present two methods for selecting a particular point in this set under

introduce a measure to evaluate how much a graph is adapted to signals under a

Large Hadronic Collider (LHC) by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality
(PMC), a procedure which resums the pQCD series using the renormalization group
(RG), thereby eliminating the dependence of the predictions on the choice of
the renormalization scheme while minimizing sensitivity to the initial choice
of the renormalization scale. In previous pQCD predictions for Higgs boson
hadroproduction, it has been conventional to assume that the renormalization
scale $\mu_r$ of the QCD coupling $\alpha_s(\mu_r)$ is the Higgs mass, and then
to vary this choice over the range $1/2 m_H < \mu_r < 2 m_H $ in order to
estimate the theory uncertainty. However, this error estimate is only sensitive
to the non-conformal $\beta$ terms in the pQCD series, and thus it fails to
correctly estimate the theory uncertainty in cases where pQCD series has large
higher order contributions, as is the case for Higgs boson hadroproduction.
Furthermore, this \mbox{\it ad hoc} choice of scale and range gives pQCD
predictions which depend on the renormalization scheme being used, in
contradiction to basic RG principles. In contrast, after applying the PMC, we
obtain next-to-next-to-leading order RG resummed pQCD predictions for Higgs
boson hadroproduction which are renormalization-scheme independent and have
minimal sensitivity to the choice of the initial renormalization scale. Taking
$m_H=125$ GeV, the PMC predictions for the $p p \to H X$ Higgs inclusive
hadroproduction cross-sections for various LHC center-of-mass energies and the
fiducial cross section $\sigma_{\rm fid}(pp\to H\to\gamma\gamma)$ are
presented...... The PMC predictions show better agreement with the ATLAS
measurements than the LHC-XS predictions which are based on conventional
renormalization scale-setting.

opposite jet-inflated bubbles can form a pair of bipolar rings around giant

shell, two opposite jets, and a spherical fast wind. We use the FLASH
hydrodynamical code in three-dimensions to simulate the flow, and obtain the
structure of the nebula. We assume that the jets are launched from an accretion
disk around a stellar companion to the giant star. The accretion disk is
assumed to be formed when the primary giant star and the secondary star suffer
a strong interaction accompanied by a rapid mass transfer process from the
primary to the secondary star, mainly a main sequence star. Later in the
evolution the primary star is assumed to shrink and blow a fast tenuous wind
that interacts with the dense gas on the surface of the bipolar structure. We
assume that the dense mass loss episode before the jets are launched is
spherically symmetric. Our results might be applicable to some planetary
nebulae, and further emphasize the large variety of morphological features that
can be formed by jets. But we could not reproduce some of the properties of the
outer rings of SN1987A. It seems that some objects, like SN1987A, require a

chains tends to alternate between neighbouring chains but this alternation is
frustrated and is not itself ordered. In neutron scattering measurements this
partial order gives rise to Bragg-like peaks, which cannot be interpreted using
conventional magnetic crystallography without resort to unphysical spin models.
The existence of low-dimensional magnetic order in Tb(HCOO)$_3$ is stabilised
by the contrasting strength of inter- and intra-chain magnetic coupling, itself
a consequence of the underlying MOF architecture. Our results demonstrate how
MOFs may provide an attractive if as yet under-explored platform for the

glues to one of them. Our universe is located on the D3 brane which wraps the
D4 brane from one end and sticks to one of the anti-D8 branes from another one.
In this system, there are three types of fields, corresponding to compacted D4
branes, intersecting branes and D3-branes. These fields interact with each
other and make the angle between branes oscillate. By decreasing this angle and
approaching the intersecting anti-D8 branes towards each other, the D4 brane
rolls, the D3 brane wraps around the D4 brane, and t he universe contracts. By
separating the intersecting branes and increasing the angle, the D4 brane rolls
in the opposite direction, the D3 brane separates from it and the expansion
branch begins. Also, the interaction between branes in this system gives us the
exact form of the relevant Lagrangian for teleparallel LQC.

orbifolds of M-brane configurations. These are realised in two different ways
that are dual to each other: either as $M$ parallel M5-branes probing a
transverse $A_{N-1}$ singularity or $N$ M5-branes probing an $A_{M-1}$
singularity. These backgrounds can further be dualised into toric, non-compact
Calabi-Yau threefolds $X_{N,M}$ which have double elliptic fibrations and thus
give a natural geometric description of T-duality of the little string
theories. The little string partition functions are captured by the topological
string partition function of $X_{N,M}$. We analyse in detail the free energies
$\Sigma_{N,M}$ associated with the latter in a special region in the K\""ahler
moduli space of $X_{N,M}$ and discover a remarkable property: in the
Nekrasov-Shatashvili-limit, $\Sigma_{N,M}$ is identical to $NM$ times
$\Sigma_{1,1}$. This entails that the BPS degeneracies for any $(N,M)$ can
uniquely be reconstructed from the $(N,M)=(1,1)$ configuration, a property we
refer to as self-similarity. Moreover, as $\Sigma_{1,1}$ is known to display a
number of recursive structures, BPS degeneracies of little string
configurations for arbitrary $(N,M)$ as well acquire additional symmetries.
These symmetries suggest that in this special region the two little string
theories described above are self-dual under T-duality.

paradigm to a multicarrier CR network, where the PU employs an orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme. To improve its
achievable data rate, besides transmitting over the subcarriers unused by the
PU, the SU is also allowed to transmit multiple block-precoded symbols in
parallel over the OFDM subcarriers used by the primary system. Specifically,
the SU convolves its block-precoded symbols with the received PU data in the
time-domain, which gives rise to the term convolutive superposition. An
information-theoretic analysis of the proposed scheme is developed, which
considers different amounts of network state information at the secondary

address blind calibration as a non-convex problem for linear random sensing

sub-Gaussian random vectors, each of which is subject to an unknown
multiplicative factor (gain). To solve this optimisation problem we resort to
projected gradient descent starting from a suitable initialisation. An analysis
of this algorithm allows us to show that it converges to the global optimum

present some numerical experiments in which our algorithm allows for a simple

red giant branch (RGB) phase of evolution. The physics of their strong stellar
winds is still poorly understood. In the standard model, stellar pulsations
extend the atmosphere, allowing a wind to be driven through radiation pressure
on condensing dust particles. Here we investigate the onset of the wind, using
nearby RGB stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalogue. We find a sharp onset of
dust production when the star first reaches a pulsation period of 60 days. This
approximately co-incides with the point where the star transitions to the first
overtone pulsation mode. Models of the spectral energy distributions show
stellar mass-loss rate suddenly increases at this point, by a factor of ~10
over the existing (chromospherically driven) wind. The dust emission is
strongly correlated with both pulsation period and amplitude, indicating
stellar pulsation is the main trigger for the strong mass loss, and determines
the mass-loss rate. Dust emission does not strongly correlate with stellar
luminosity, indicating radiation pressure on dust has little effect on the
mass-loss rate. RGB stars do not normally appear to produce dust, whereas dust
production by asymptotic giant branch stars appears commonplace, and is
probably ubiquitous above the RGB-tip luminosity. We conclude that the strong
wind begins with a step change in mass-loss rate, and is triggered by stellar
pulsations. A second rapid mass-loss-rate enhancement is suggested when the
star transitions to the fundamental pulsation mode, at a period of ~300 days.

finite element method on hybrid non-conforming hexahedral-tetrahedral meshes.
By non-conforming, we mean that a quadrangular face of a hexahedron can be
connected to two triangular faces of tetrahedra. We introduce a set of
low-order continuous (C0) finite element spaces defined on these meshes. They
are built from standard tri-linear and quadratic Lagrange finite elements with
an extra set of constraints at non-conforming hexahedra-tetrahedra junctions to
recover continuity. We consider both the continuity of the geometry and the
continuity of the function basis as follows: the continuity of the geometry is
achieved by using quadratic mappings for tetrahedra connected to tri-affine
hexahedra and the continuity of interpolating functions is enforced in a
similar manner by using quadratic Lagrange basis on tetrahedra with constraints
at non-conforming junctions to match tri-linear hexahedra. The so-defined
function spaces are validated numerically on simple Poisson and linear
elasticity problems for which an analytical solution is known. We observe that
using a hybrid mesh with the proposed function spaces results in an accuracy
significantly better than when using linear tetrahedra and slightly worse than
when solely using tri-linear hexahedra. As a consequence, the proposed function
spaces may be a promising alternative for complex geometries that are out of
reach of existing full hexahedral meshing methods.

There, we showed that these models agree with the most recent cosmological
data. In this work, we used updated cosmological data sets to derive new
constraints on Galileon models, including the case of a constant conformal
Galileon coupling to matter. We also explored the tracker solution of the
uncoupled Galileon model. After updating our data sets, especially with the
latest \textit{Planck} data and BAO measurements, we fitted the cosmological
parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM and Galileon models. The same analysis framework
as in our previous papers was used to derive cosmological constraints, using
precise measurements of cosmological distances and of the cosmic structure
growth rate. We showed that all tested Galileon models are as compatible with
cosmological data as the $\Lambda$CDM model. This means that present
cosmological data are not accurate enough to distinguish clearly between both
theories. Among the different Galileon models, we found that a conformal
coupling is not favoured, contrary to the disformal coupling which is preferred
at the $2.3\sigma$ level over the uncoupled case. The tracker solution of the
uncoupled Galileon model is also highly disfavoured due to large tensions with
supernovae and \textit{Planck}+BAO data. However, outside of the tracker
solution, the general uncoupled Galileon model, as well as the general
disformally coupled Galileon model, remain the most promising Galileon
scenarios to confront with future cosmological data. Finally, we also discuss
constraints coming from Lunar Laser Ranging experiment and gravitational wave
speed of propagation.

geometry around the inner accretion flow in supermassive black holes, has been
discovered in several of the brightest, most variable and well-known Seyfert
galaxies. In this work, we expand the study of X-ray reverberation to all
Seyfert galaxies in the XMM-Newton archive above a nominal rms variability and
exposure level (a total of 43 sources). 50 per cent of source exhibit iron K
reverberation, in that the broad iron K emission line responds to rapid
variability in the continuum. We also find that on long timescales, the hard
band emission lags behind the soft band emission in 85 per cent of sources.
This `low-frequency hard lag' is likely associated with the coronal emission,
and so this result suggests that most sources with X-ray variability show
intrinsic variability from the nuclear region. We update the known iron K lag
amplitude vs. black hole mass relation, and find evidence that the height or
extent of the coronal source (as inferred by the reverberation time delay)
increases with mass accretion rate.

regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e.,
there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad
theoretical conditions, but the clusters may not be connected. $\ell_2$ and
nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity, but give a

$\ell_2$ and nuclear norm regularizations offer a balance between the
subspace-preserving and connectedness properties, but this comes at the cost of
increased computational complexity. This paper studies the geometry of the
elastic net regularizer (a mixture of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms) and uses
it to derive a provably correct and scalable active set method for finding the

enriches the choices of coding operations at intermediate nodes, and there is a

two moment bulk cloud microphysics model for collision and coalescence in warm
rain based on the kinetic coalescence equation (KCE) and used stochastic
approximations to close the higher order moment terms, and do so independently
of the collision kernel. Conservation of mass and consistency of droplet number
concentration of the evolving cloud properties were combined with numerical
simulations to reduce the parametrization problem to three key parameters.
  Here, we constrain these three parameters based on the physics of collision

theoretically validate the new bulk model by deriving a subset of the ""region

  Furthermore, sensitivity tests indicate that the stochastically derived model
can be used with a time step as large as 30 seconds without significantly
compromising accuracy, which makes it very attractive to use in medium to long

select parameters in the ""region of validity"" that are conditional on

structural stability of equilibriums, arising from real dynamical systems. We
show that dynamical stability, quantified via systems local response to
external perturbations, coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able
to destabilize the equilibrium. First, by reformulating a result of control
theory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral
sensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant
changes of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary
changes of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with
dynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this
issue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical
and structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and
internal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a system's local
response to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of
internal white noise that it can accommodate before asymptotic mean-square
stability of the equilibrium is lost.

However, the neutral object radiates high energy or short wavelength radiation
without any suppression. In that case, radiation from each particle can be
treated independently, and it is called the decoherent radiation. We compare a
hydrogen atom's decoherent Larmor radiation with its gravitational radiation
while the atom is in a circular orbit around a star. Gravitational radiation is
stronger than the electromagnetic radiation if the orbital radius is larger

systems, taking photogravitational effects of both the stars. The aim of this
study is to investigate the motion of the infinitesimal mass in the vicinity of
the Lagrangian points. We have computed semi-analytical expressions for the
locations of the collinear points with the help of the perturbation technique.
The stability of the triangular points is studied in stellar binary systems
Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-413 and Kepler-16. To investigate the stability of
the triangular points, we have obtained the expressions for critical mass which
depends on the radiation of both primaries. Fourier-series method is applied to
obtain periodic orbits of the infinitesimal mass around triangular points in
binary stellar systems. We have obtained Fourier expansions of the periodic
orbits around triangular points upto third order terms. A comparison is made
between periodic orbits obtained by Fourier-series method and with Runge-Kutta
integration of fourth order.

  Analysis Under Discrete Fuzzy Sets","10 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, 22 references","International Journal of Fuzzy Logic Systems 6 (2016) 53-62",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fuzzy logic is an alternate approach for quantifying uncertainty relating to
activity duration. The fuzzy version of the backward recursion has been shown
to produce results that incorrectly amplify the level of uncertainty. However,
the fuzzy version of the forward recursion has been widely proposed as an
approach for determining the fuzzy set of critical path lengths. In this paper,
the direct application of the extension principle leads to a proposition that
must be satisfied in fuzzy critical path analysis. Using a counterexample it is
demonstrated that the fuzzy forward recursion when discrete fuzzy sets are used
to represent activity durations produces results that are not consistent with
the theory presented. The problem is shown to be the application of the fuzzy
maximum. Several methods presented in the literature are described and shown to
provide results that are consistent with the extension principle.
