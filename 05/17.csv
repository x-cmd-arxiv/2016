can provide a better total precision than estimating them individually. We show
this for a multimode interferometer with a phase in each mode, using Gaussian
inputs and passive elements, by calculating the covariance matrix. The quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound provides a lower bound to the covariance matrix via the
quantum Fisher information matrix, whose elements we derive to be the
covariances of the photon numbers across the modes. We prove that this bound
can be saturated. In spite of the Gaussian nature of the problem, the
calculation of non-Gaussian integrals is required, which we accomplish
analytically. We find our simultaneous strategy to yield no more than a
factor-of-2 improvement in total precision, possibly because of a fundamental
performance limitation of Gaussian states. Our work shows that no modal

Newtonian interpretations, a significant amount of dark matter is required to
explain observed kinematics. In fact, they are in this sense the most heavily
dark matter dominated objects known. That, plus the increasingly small sizes of
the newly discovered ultra faint dwarfs, puts these systems in the regime where
dynamical friction on individual stars starts to become relevant. We calculate
the dynamical friction timescales for pressure supported isotropic spherical
dark matter dominated stellar systems, yielding $\tau_{DF} =0.93 (r_{h}/10
pc)^{2} (\sigma/ kms^{-1}) Gyr$, { where $r_{h}$ is the half-light radius}. For
a stellar velocity dispersion value of $3 km/s$, as typical for the smallest of
the recently detected ultra faint dwarf spheroidals, dynamical friction
timescales becomes smaller than the $10 Gyr$ typical of the stellar ages for
these systems, for $r_{h}<19 pc$. Thus, this becomes a theoretical lower limit
below which dark matter dominated stellar systems become unstable to dynamical
friction. We present a comparison with structural parameters of the smallest
ultra faint dwarf spheroidals known, showing that these are already close to
the stability limit derived, any future detection of yet smaller such systems
would be inconsistent with a particle dark matter hypothesis.

Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations by a particular class of monotone
approximation schemes known as semi-Lagrangian schemes. These schemes make use
of a wide stencil to achieve convergence and result in discretization matrices
that are less sparse and less local than those coming from standard finite
difference schemes. This leads to computational difficulties not encountered
there. In particular, we consider the overstepping of the domain boundary and
analyse the accuracy and stability of stencil truncation. This truncation
imposes a stricter CFL condition for explicit schemes in the vicinity of
boundaries than in the interior, such that implicit schemes become attractive.
We then study the use of geometric, algebraic and aggregation-based multigrid
preconditioners to solve the resulting discretised systems from implicit time
stepping schemes efficiently. Finally, we illustrate the performance of these
techniques numerically for benchmark test cases from the literature.

horizontal branch or the asymptotic giant branch star of the cluster, but it is
statistically possible that this is a chance superposition. This interpretation
is supported by optical spectroscopt obtained with HST/STIS: the spectrum
contains none of the strong emission lines that would be expected if the object
was a symbiotic star (i.e. a compact accretor fed by a giant donor). We
therefore consider two other possibilities for the nature of FUV variable: (i)
an intermediate polar (i.e. a compact binary containing an accreting magnetic
white dwarf), or (ii) an AM CVn star (i.e. an interacting double-degenerate
system). In the intermediate polar scenario, the object is expected to be an
X-ray source. However, no X-rays are detected at its location in $\simeq
65$~ksec of {\em Chandra} imaging, which limits the X-ray luminosity to $L_X
\leqslant 10^{32}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. We therefore favour the AM CVn interpretation,
but a FUV spectrum is needed to distinguish conclusively between the two
possibilities. If the object is an AM CVn binary, it would be the first such
system known in any globular cluster.

described by a near edge absorption feature at 1849$\pm$0.002 eV and a far edge
absorption feature at 1865$\pm$0.002 eV. Both of these absorption features
appear variable with equivalent widths up to several m\AA. We can describe the
edge structure with several components: multiple edge functions, near edge
absorption excesses from silicates in dust form, signatures from X-ray
scattering optical depths, and a variable warm absorber from ionized atomic
silicon. The measured optical depths of the edges indicate much higher values
than expected from atomic silicon cross sections and ISM abundances, and appear
consistent with predictions from silicate X-ray absorption and scattering. A
comparison with models also indicates a preference for larger dust grain sizes.

radiative heating by constructing temperature maps from the ratio of SCUBA-2
fluxes using a fixed dust opacity spectral index, {\beta} = 1.8, and a beam
convolution kernel to achieve a common 14.8"" resolution. We identify 82 clumps
ranging between 10 and 36K with a mean temperature of 20{\pm}3K. Clump
temperature is strongly correlated with proximity to the external OB
association and there is no evidence that the embedded protostars significantly
heat the dust. We identify 31 clumps that have cores with densities greater
than 105cm{^{-3}}. Thirteen of these cores contain embedded Class 0/I
protostars. Many cores are associated with bright-rimmed clouds seen in
Herschel 70 {\mu}m images. From JCMT HARP observations of the 12CO 3-2 line, we
find contamination of the 850{\mu}m band of up to 20 per cent. We investigate
the free-free contribution to SCUBA-2 bands from large-scale and ultracompact H
ii regions using archival VLA data and find the contribution is limited to
individual stars, accounting for 9 per cent of flux per beam at 450 {\mu}m or
12 per cent at 850 {\mu}m in these cases. We conclude that radiative heating
has potentially influenced the formation of stars in the Dust Arc sub-region,
favouring Jeans stable clouds in the warm east and fragmentation in the cool
west.

regimes resulting in radically different characteristics. This poses two
complexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on
physical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating
observations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span
across different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since
the majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova
remnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by
means of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow
shock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft. We find
that Saturn's bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and
astrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the
upstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we determined the {\theta}Bn of
each crossing to show that Saturn's (dayside) bow shock is predominantly
quasi-perpendicular by virtue of the Parker spiral at 10 AU. Our results
suggest a strong dependence on MA in controlling the onset of physical
mechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly non-time stationarity and
variability. We anticipate our comprehensive assessment will yield deeper
insight into high MA collisionless shocks and provide a broader scope for
understanding the structures and mechanisms of collisionless shocks.

probed by the rotation angle and ellipticity, which are mainly determined by
the off-diagonal susceptibility $\chi^{(1)}_{xy}$. A direct and analytic
relation between $S_z$ and $\chi^{(1)}_{xy}$ is necessary and of paramount
importance to the success of magneto-optics, but is often difficult to acquire
since quantum mechanically the relation is hidden in the sum-over-states. Here
we propose a new and simple model to establish such a much needed relation. Our
model is based on the Hookean model, but includes spin-orbit coupling. Under cw
excitation, we show that $\chi^{(1)}_{xy}(\omega)$ is indeed directly
proportional to $S_z$ for a fixed photon frequency $\omega$. Such an elegant
relation is encouraging, and we wonder whether our model can describe spin
dynamics as well. By allowing the spin to change dynamically, to our surprise,
our model predicts that an ultrafast laser pulse can induce a spin precession;
with appropriate parameters, the laser can even reverse spin from one direction
to another. This works for both the circularly and linearly polarized light.
The spin reversal window is narrow. These unexpected results closely resemble
all-optical helicity-dependent magnetic switching found in much more
complicated ferrimagnetic rare earth compounds. Therefore, we believe that our
spin-orbit coupled model may find some important applications in spin switching
processes, a hot topic in femtomagnetism.

observe the variabilities in three Wolf-Rayet stars. The spectroscopic data
have been analyzed for WR 134 (WN6b), to better understand its behaviour and
long-term periodicity, which we interpret as arising from corotating
interaction regions (CIRs) in the wind. By analyzing the variability of the He
II $\lambda$5411 emission line, the previously identified period was refined to
P = 2.255 $\pm$ 0.008 (s.d.) days. The coherency time of the variability, which
we associate with the lifetime of the CIRs in the wind, was deduced to be 40
$\pm$ 6 days, or $\sim$ 18 cycles, by cross-correlating the variability
patterns as a function of time. When comparing the phased observational
grayscale difference images with theoretical grayscales previously calculated
from models including CIRs in an optically thin stellar wind, we find that two
CIRs were likely present. A separation in longitude of $\Delta \phi \simeq$
90$^{\circ}$ was determined between the two CIRs and we suggest that the
different maximum velocities that they reach indicate that they emerge from
different latitudes. We have also been able to detect observational signatures
of the CIRs in other spectral lines (C IV $\lambda\lambda$5802,5812 and He I
$\lambda$5876). Furthermore, a DAC was found to be present simultaneously with
the CIR signatures detected in the He I $\lambda$5876 emission line which is
consistent with the proposed geometry of the large-scale structures in the
wind. Small-scale structures also show a presence in the wind, simultaneously
with the larger scale structures, showing that they do in fact co-exist.

networks that benefits companies, passengers and the environment. In this

evolution). We emphasize that most previous research focused on the first
modeling approach (i.e. long-term) whereas only a few studies look at
high-resolution temporal paths. We conclude the review highlighting that much
research remains to be done, both to apply already available methods and to
develop new measures for temporal paths on air transport networks. In
particular, we identify that the study of delays, network resilience and
optimization of resources (aircraft and crew) are critical topics that can

calculation of the structure of driven steady-state planar detonations
performed with a large nuclear reaction network and error-controlled

the requirement of classical kappa-symmetry of the Green-Schwarz superstring.
In the type I case we find that the background must satisfy a generalization of
type I supergravity equations. These equations depend on an arbitrary vector
X_a and imply the one-loop scale invariance of the GS sigma model. In the
special case when X_a is the gradient of a scalar \phi (dilaton) one recovers
the standard type I equations equivalent to the 2d Weyl invariance conditions
of the superstring sigma model. In the type II case we find a generalized
version of the 10d supergravity equations the bosonic part of which was
introduced in arXiv:1511.05795. These equations depend on two vectors \X_a and
K_a subject to 1st order differential relations (with the equations in the
NS-NS sector depending only on the combination X_a = \X_a + K_a). In the
special case of K_a=0 one finds that \X_a=\d_a \phi and thus obtains the
standard type II supergravity equations. New generalized solutions are found if
K_a is chosen to be a Killing vector (and thus they exist only if the metric
admits an isometry). Non-trivial solutions of the generalized equations
describe K-isometric backgrounds that can be mapped by T-duality to type II
supergravity solutions with dilaton containing a linear isometry-breaking term.
Examples of such backgrounds appeared recently in the context of integrable
\eta-deformations of AdS_n x S^n sigma models. The classical kappa-symmetry
thus does not, in general, imply the 2d Weyl invariance conditions for the GS
sigma model (equivalent to type II supergravity equations) but only weaker
scale invariance type conditions.

Boolean variables, that in his opinion represents a demarcation line between
possible and impossible experience. This inequality forms an important
milestone in the epistemology of probability theory and probability measures.
  In 1985 Leggett and Garg derived a physics related inequality, mathematically
identical to Boole's, that according to them represents a demarcation between
macroscopic realism and quantum mechanics. Their formalism, constructed for the
magnetic flux of SQUIDS, includes general features and applies also to many
other quantum experiments.
  We show that a wide gulf, a wide divide, separates the ""sense impressions""
and corresponding data, as well as the postulates of macroscopic realism, from
the mathematical abstractions that are used to derive the inequality of
Leggett-Garg. If the gulf can be bridged, one may indeed derive the said
inequality, which is then clearly a demarcation between possible and impossible
experience: it cannot be violated and is not violated by quantum theory. We
deduce from this fact that a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality does not
mean that the SQUID-flux is not there when nobody looks, as Leggett-Garg
suggest, but instead that the probability measures may not be what Leggett-Garg
have assumed them to be, when no data can be secured that directly relate to
them. We show that similar considerations apply to other well known quantum
interpretation-puzzles including that of the two-slit experiment.

expansions, at strong coupling and also demonstrated its invariance under the
Seiberg-like duality. This match also gives further support to the
integrability of the model. If our conjecture is correct, it extends all the

space we find the NSI can induce neutrino collective effects in scenarios where

We find that the pseudo-continuum level is very sensitive to C/O and that all
metallicity indicators show a dependence on C and O abundances, especially in
lower Teff models. In some cases the inferred metallicity ranges over a full
order of magnitude (>1 dex) when [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are varied independently by
+/-0.2. We also find that [(O-C)/Fe], the difference in O and C abundances, is
a better tracer of the pseudo-continuum level than C/O. Models of mid-M dwarfs
with [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and [M/H] that are realistic in the context of galactic
chemical evolution suggest that variation in [(O-C)/Fe] is the primary physical
mechanism behind the M dwarf metallicity tracers investigated here. Empirically
calibrated metallicity indicators are still valid for most nearby M dwarfs due
to the tight correlation between [(O-C)/Fe] and [Fe/H] evident in spectroscopic
surveys of solar neighborhood FGK stars. Variations in C and O abundances also
affect the spectral energy distribution of M dwarfs. Allowing [O/Fe] to be a
free parameter provides better agreement between synthetic spectra and observed
spectra of metal-rich M dwarfs. We suggest that flux-calibrated,
low-resolution, NIR spectra can provide a path toward measuring C and O
abundances in M dwarfs and breaking the degeneracy between C/O and [Fe/H]

between B0.5 and B1 Ib, settling the debate on the true nature of this source.
We measured a high rotation velocity of v = 320 +/- 8 km/s from fitting
absorption and emission lines in a stellar spectral model. We then built a
spectral energy distribution from photometric observations to evaluate the
origin of the different components radiating at each energy range. We finally
show that, having accurately determined the spectral type of the early-B
supergiant in IGR J16465-4507, we firmly support its classification as an
intermediate supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT).

baryons in a paradigmatic bright-galaxy halo. Lyman-alpha absorption is
detected along all sightlines and Si III 1206 is found along the 3 smallest
impact parameter sightlines; metal lines of C II, Si II and Si IV are only
found with certainty towards the inner-most sightline. The kinematics of the
absorption lines are best replicated by a model with a disk-like distribution
of gas approximately planar to the observed 21 cm H I disk, that is rotating
more slowly than the inner disk, and into which gas is infalling from the
intergalactic medium. Some part of the absorption towards the inner-most

associated with the minor merger that gives rise to the well known `dog-leg'
stellar stream that projects from NGC 1097. When compared to other studies, NGC
1097 appears to be a `typical' absorber, although the large dispersion in

methods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high
accuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of
the planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the
astrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to
inhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and
observations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We
model the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking
whether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an
Earth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when
using astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space
for which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still
not be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of
dust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric
signal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary
discs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of
inhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation
is a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study
the case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable
IR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual
instruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which
consists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner
debris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved.

unique manner through distance ratios involving the source and lens. This is
well known for the time delay distance derived from measured delays between
lightcurves of the images of variable sources such as quasars. Recently, double
source plane lens systems involving two constant sources lensed by the same
foreground lens have been proposed as another probe, involving a different
ratio of distances measured from the image positions and fairly insensitive to
the lens modeling. Here we demonstrate that these two different sets of strong
lensing distance ratios have strong complementarity in cosmological leverage.
Unlike other probes, the double source distance ratio is actually more
sensitive to the dark energy equation of state parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ than
to the matter density $\Omega_m$, for low redshift lenses. Adding double source
distance ratio measurements can improve the dark energy figure of merit by 40%

expected yield of such planets. Recent efforts to increase the estimated
yields, by creating observation plans optimized for the detection and
characterization of Earth-twins, have focused solely on coronagraphic
instruments; starshade-based missions could benefit from a similar analysis.
Here we explore how to prioritize observations for a starshade given the
limiting resources of both fuel and time, present analytic expressions to
estimate fuel use, and provide efficient numerical techniques for maximizing
the yield of starshades. We implemented these techniques to create an
approximate design reference mission code for starshades and used this code to
investigate how exoEarth candidate yield responds to changes in mission,
instrument, and astrophysical parameters for missions with a single starshade.
We find that a starshade mission operates most efficiently somewhere between
the fuel- and exposure-time limited regimes, and as a result, is less sensitive
to photometric noise sources as well as parameters controlling the photon
collection rate in comparison to a coronagraph. We produced optimistic yield
curves for starshades, assuming our optimized observation plans are schedulable
and future starshades are not thrust-limited. Given these yield curves,
detecting and characterizing several dozen exoEarth candidates requires either
multiple starshades or an eta_Earth > ~0.3.

junction or bias voltages to drive it, in what is termed photogalvanic effect.
These currents are strongly dependent on the polarization state of the
radiation, as well as on topological properties of the underlying Fermi surface
such as its Berry curvature. In order to study the intrinsic photogalvanic
response of gapped graphene (GG), biased bilayer graphene (BBG), and hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), we compute the non-linear current using a perturbative
expansion of the density matrix. This allows a microscopic description of the
quadratic response to an electromagnetic field in these materials, which we
analyze as a function of temperature and electron density. We find that the
intrinsic response is robust across these systems and allows for currents in
the range of pA cm/W to nA cm/W. At the independent-particle level, the
response of hBN-based structures is significant only in the ultra-violet due to
their sizeable band-gap. However, when Coulomb interactions are accounted for
by explicit solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we find that the
photoconductivity is strongly modified by transitions involving exciton levels
in the gap region, whose spectral weight dominates in the overall frequency
range. Biased bilayers and gapped monolayers of graphene have a strong
photoconductivity in the visible and infrared window, allowing for photocurrent
densities of several nA cm/W. We further show that the richer electronic
dispersion of BBG at low energies and the ability to change its band-gap on

those in the comparison sample, and have ~50% lower median oxygen abundances.
Both factors are likely to facilitate the escape of Ly-alpha: in less dusty
galaxies Ly-alpha photons are less likely to be absorbed during multiple
scatterings, while the harder ionizing spectrum and higher ionization parameter
associated with strong, low metallicity star formation may reduce the covering
fraction or column density of neutral hydrogen, further easing Ly-alpha escape.

also describes the physics of the dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting
circuits, the Unruh effect, and Hawking radiation. Here we study the
communication capabilities of quantum amplifier channels. Invoking a recently
established minimum output-entropy theorem for single-mode phase-insensitive
Gaussian channels, we determine capacities of quantum-limited amplifier
channels in three different scenarios. First, we establish the capacities of
quantum-limited amplifier channels for one of the most general communication
tasks, characterized by the trade-off between classical communication, quantum
communication, and entanglement generation or consumption. Second, we establish
capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels for the trade-off between
public classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key
generation. Third, we determine the capacity region for a broadcast channel
induced by the quantum-limited amplifier channel, and we also show that a fully
quantum strategy outperforms those achieved by classical coherent detection
strategies. In all three scenarios, we find that the capacities significantly
outperform communication rates achieved with a naive time-sharing strategy.

of SNRs in the context of their host galaxies. We introduce a semi-analytic
model that reproduces the statistical properties of a radio continuum-selected
SNR population, taking into account the detection limits of radio surveys, the
range of SN kinetic energies, the measured ISM and stellar mass distribution in
the host galaxy from multi-wavelength images and the current understanding of
electron acceleration and field amplification in SNR shocks from
first-principle kinetic simulations. Applying our model to the SNR population
in M33, we reproduce the SNR radio luminosity function with a median SN rate of
$\sim 3.1 \times 10^{-3}$ per year and an electron acceleration efficiency,
$\epsilon_{\rm{e}} \sim 4.2 \times 10^{-3}$. We predict that the radio
visibility times of $\sim 70\%$ of M33 SNRs will be determined by their
Sedov-Taylor lifetimes, and correlated with the measured ISM column density,
$N_H$ ($t_{\rm{vis}} \propto N_H^{-a}$, with $a \sim 0.33$) while the remaining
will have visibility times determined by the detection limit of the radio
survey. These observational constraints on the visibility time of SNRs will
allow us to use SNR catalogs as `SN surveys' to calculate SN rates and delay
time distributions in the Local Group.

supernovae in hosts with high measured gas-phase metallicities are found to
explode at large galactocentric radii, indicating that the metallicity at the
explosion site is likely lower than the integrated host value. We found that
superluminous supernovae hosts do not always have star-formation rates higher
than typical star-forming galaxies of the same mass. However, we confirm that
high absolute specific star-formation rates are a feature of superluminous

anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and specific star-formation rate
and the requirement of on-going star formation to produce young, massive stars
greater than ~ 10-20 M_sol. Based on our sample, we propose an upper limit of ~
0.5 Z_sol for forming superluminous supernova progenitors (assuming an N2

to be responsible for excavating the Local Bubble in the interstellar medium

probable cases, combining photon and cosmic ray effects, we find that a
supernova at 100 pc can have only a small effect on terrestrial organisms from
visible light and that chemical changes such as ozone depletion are weak.
However, tropospheric ionization right down to the ground due to the
penetration of $\geq$TeV cosmic rays will increase by nearly an order of
magnitude for thousands of years, and irradiation by muons on the ground and in
the upper ocean will increase 20-fold, which will approximately triple the
overall radiation load on terrestrial organisms. Such irradiation has been
linked to possible changes in climate and increased cancer and mutation rates.
This may be related to a minor mass extinction around the Pliocene-Pleistocene
boundary, and further research on the effects is needed.

complete consideration of all potential situations of a robot's environment is
nearly impossible in real-world applications, making it difficult for the
co-robot to act appropriately and safely in new scenarios. This is true even

(CMEs) is measured in 399 M and X-class flare events observed during the first
3.5 yrs of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission, using a new method
based on the EUV dimming effect. The EUV dimming is modeled in terms of a
radial adiabatic expansion process, which is fitted to the observed evolution
of the total emission measure of the CME source region. The model derives the
evolution of the mean electron density, the emission measure, the bulk plasma
expansion velocity, the mass, and the energy in the CME source region. The EUV
dimming method is truly complementary to the Thomson scattering method in white
light, which probes the CME evolution in the heliosphere at $r > 2 R_{\odot}$,
while the EUV dimming method tracks the CME launch in the corona. We compare
the CME parameters obtained in white light with the LASCO/C2 coronagraph with
those obtained from EUV dimming with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard SDO for all identical events in both data sets. We investigate
correlations between CME parameters, the relative timing with flare parameters,
frequency occurrence distributions, and the energy partition between magnetic,
thermal, nonthermal, and CME energies. CME energies are found to be
systematically lower than the dissipated magnetic energies, which is consistent
with a magnetic origin of CMEs.

the atmosphere and the ocean through the mean force they exert as they interact
with the flow. A key to this interaction is the presence of critical-level
singularities or, when planetary rotation is taken into account, inertial-level
singularities, where the Doppler-shifted wave frequency matches the local
Coriolis frequency. We examine the role of the latter singularities by studying
the steady wavepacket generated by a multiscale mountain in a rotating linear
shear flow at low Rossby number. Using a combination of WKB and saddle-point
approximations, we provide an explicit description of the form of the
wavepacket, of the mean forcing it induces, and of the mean-flow response.
  We identify two distinguished regimes of wave propagation: Regime I applies
far enough from a dominant inertial level for the standard ray-tracing
approximation to be valid; Regime II applies to a thin region where the
wavepacket structure is controlled by the inertial-level singularities. The
wave--mean-flow interaction is governed by the change in Eliassen--Palm (or
pseudomomentum) flux. This change is localised in a thin inertial layer where
the wavepacket takes a limiting form of that found in Regime II. We solve a
quasi-geostrophic potential-vorticity equation forced by the divergence of the
Eliassen--Palm flux to compute the wave-induced mean flow. Our results,
obtained in an inviscid limit, show that the wavepacket reaches a
large-but-finite distance downstream of the mountain (specifically, a distance
of order $k_*^{1/2} \Delta^{3/2}$, where $k_*^{-1}$ and $\Delta$ measure the
wave and envelope scales of the mountain) and extends horizontally over a
similar scale.

Operational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public
roads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are
time-consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an
accelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate
motions of the primary other vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in
simulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins
is the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe
lane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data
collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program.
The cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected
human driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving
the statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in
non-accelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The Cross Entropy method is
used to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies
of occurrence of conflicts, crashes and injuries are estimated for a modeled
automated vehicle, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2,000 to 20,000.
In other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1,000 miles will
expose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million
miles of real-world driving to encounter. This technique thus has the potential
to reduce greatly the development and validation time for AVs.

path tree (SPT) schemes according to the various traffic loads in CRN to
determine the path selection method and used the probability of Success (POS)
metric for the channel assignment that used the required transmission time and
the channel availability time in choosing unified channel. The main objective
of our algorithm is to reduce the total number of the expected packet
transmissions (with retransmissions) needed for successfully forwarding a data
packet to a specific group of destinations and provide guarantees on the
chances of a successful transmission over a given channel. This metric is
capable to capture the CRNs environment, in which the channel availabilities
are diversity and dynamically changing due to the dynamic and uncertainty
activity of PUs. Our proposed protocol achieves high-throughput and packet
delivery rate (PDR) through a joint channel assignment and path selection to
the specific destinations. Simulation results is used to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of throughput and packet
delivery rate compared to other existing multi-cast routing protocols over
different network conditions by using matlab as a simulations.

influence the flow of circumstellar matter. In stars with accretion disks, the
stellar magnetic field can truncate the inner disk and determine the paths that
matter can take to flow onto the star. These paths are different in stars with
different magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the
magnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from
the disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the
propeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.
Outflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating
stars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,
strongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or
propagation of stellar wind outflows. Winds from low-mass, solar-type stars may
be either thermally or magnetically driven, while winds from massive, luminous
O and B type stars are radiatively driven. In all of these cases, the magnetic
field influences matter flow from the stars and determines many observational

range of supersonic relative velocities between the embryo and the circularly
orbiting gas and dust, prompting the formation of bow shocks. Temporary
atmospheres around these embryos, which can be created via volatile outgassing
and gas capture from the surrounding nebula, can non-trivially affect thermal
profiles of solids entering the shock. We explore the thermal environment of
solids that traverse the bow shock at different impact radii, the effects that
planetoid atmospheres have on shock morphologies, and the stripping efficiency
of planetoidal atmospheres in the presence of high relative winds. Simulations
are run using adiabatic and radiative conditions, with multiple treatments for

in all-optical networks, we study two variants of the classic job interval
scheduling problem, where a reusable resource is allocated to competing job
intervals in a flexible manner. Each job, $J_i$, requires the use of up to
$r_{max}(i)$ units of the resource, with a profit of $p_i \geq 1$ accrued for
each allocated unit. The goal is to feasibly schedule a subset of the jobs so
as to maximize the total profit. The resource can be allocated either in
contiguous or non-contiguous blocks. These problems can be viewed as flexible
variants of the well known storage allocation and bandwidth allocation
problems.
  We show that the contiguous version is strongly NP-hard, already for
instances where all jobs have the same profit and the same maximum resource
requirement. For such instances, we derive the best possible positive result,
namely, a polynomial time approximation scheme. We further show that the
contiguous variant admits a $(\frac{5}{4} + \varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm, for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, on instances whose job intervals
form a proper interval graph. At the heart of the algorithm lies a non-standard
parameterization of the approximation ratio itself, which is of independent
interest.
  For the non-contiguous case, we uncover an interesting relation to the paging
problem that leads to a simple $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for uniform profit
instances of n jobs. The algorithm is easy to implement and is thus practical.

decomposing polytopes and polynomials in ways that allow us to perform
nonlinear optimization. We start off by explaining important results on
decomposing a polytope into special polyhedra. We use these decompositions and
develop methods for computing a special class of integrals exactly. Namely, we
are interested in computing the exact value of integrals of polynomial
functions over convex polyhedra. We present prior work and new extensions of
the integration algorithms. Every integration method we present requires that
the polynomial has a special form. We explore two special polynomial
decomposition algorithms that are useful for integrating polynomial functions.
Both polynomial decompositions have strengths and weaknesses, and we experiment
with how to practically use them.
  After developing practical algorithms and efficient software tools for
integrating a polynomial over a polytope, we focus on the problem of maximizing
a polynomial function over the continuous domain of a polytope. This
maximization problem is NP-hard, but we develop approximation methods that run
in polynomial time when the dimension is fixed. Moreover, our algorithm for
approximating the maximum of a polynomial over a polytope is related to
integrating the polynomial over the polytope. We show how the integration
methods can be used for optimization.
  The second central topic in this dissertation is on problems in data science.
We first consider a heuristic for mixed-integer linear optimization. We show
how many practical mixed-integer linear have a special substructure containing
set partition constraints. We then describe a nice data structure for finding
feasible zero-one integer solutions to systems of set partition constraints.
Finally, we end with an applied project using data science methods in medical
research.

correlated failures resulting in simultaneous failure (or, unavailability) of
blocks of nodes are common. In such scenarios, the stored data or a content of
a failed node can only be reconstructed from the available live nodes belonging
to the available blocks. To analyze the resilience of the system against such
block failures, this work introduces the framework of Block Failure Resilient
(BFR) codes, wherein the data (e.g., a file in DSS) can be decoded by reading
out from a same number of codeword symbols (nodes) from a subset of available
blocks of the underlying codeword. Further, repairable BFR codes are
introduced, wherein any codeword symbol in a failed block can be repaired by
contacting a subset of remaining blocks in the system. File size bounds for
repairable BFR codes are derived, and the trade-off between per node storage
and repair bandwidth is analyzed, and the corresponding minimum storage
regenerating (BFR-MSR) and minimum bandwidth regenerating (BFR-MBR) points are
derived. Explicit codes achieving the two operating points for a special case
of parameters are constructed, wherein the underlying regenerating codewords
are distributed to BFR codeword symbols according to combinatorial designs.
Finally, BFR locally repairable codes (BFR-LRC) are introduced, an upper bound
on the resilience is derived and optimal code construction are provided by a
concatenation of Gabidulin and MDS codes. Repair efficiency of BFR-LRC is
further studied via the use of BFR-MSR/MBR codes as local codes. Code
constructions achieving optimal resilience for BFR-MSR/MBR-LRCs are provided

simulations of accretion flows around stellar mass black holes, we report that
the relatively cold disk ($\gtrsim 10^{7}$K) is truncated near the black hole.
Hot and less-dense regions, of which the gas temperature is $ \gtrsim 10^9$K
and more than ten times higher than the radiation temperature (overheated
regions), appear within the truncation radius. The overheated regions also
appear above as well as below the disk, and sandwich the cold disk, leading to
the effective Compton upscattering. The truncation radius is $\sim 30 r_{\rm
g}$ for $\dot{M} \sim L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, where $r_{\rm g}, \dot M,
L_\mathrm{Edd}, c$ are the gravitational radius, mass accretion rate, Eddington
luminosity, and light speed. Our results are consistent with observations of
very high state, whereby the truncated disk is thought to be embedded in the
hot rarefied regions. The truncation radius shifts inward to $\sim 10 r_{\rm
g}$ with increasing mass accretion rate $\dot{M} \sim 100 L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$,
which is very close to an innermost stable circular orbit. This model
corresponds to the slim disk state observed in ultra luminous X-ray sources.
Although the overheated regions shrink if the Compton cooling effectively
reduces the gas temperature, the sandwich-structure does not disappear at the
range of $\dot{M} \lesssim 100L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$. Our simulations also reveal
that the gas temperature in the overheated regions depends on black hole spin,
which would be due to efficient energy transport from black hole to disks
through the Poynting flux, resulting gas heating.

Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised structured ensemble learning

finding a compact and discriminative low-dimensional subspace representation in

temporal heterogeneities for the first 100 kyr of star formation. Therefore,
the observed differences in $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratios between FUN and
canonical CAIs are likely not caused by admixing of supernova material during
the early evolution of the proto-Sun. Selective thermal processing of dust
grains is a more viable scenario to account for the heterogeneity in

microstructures under the core shows that they have similar timescales to those
of the largely conal radiation of other pulsars studied earlier.
Aberration/retardation analysis was here possible for both the conal and core
radiation and showed average physical emission heights of about 200 km for
each. Comparison with other core-cone pulsars suggests that the core and conal
emission arises from similar heights. Assuming the inner vacuum gap model, we
note that at these emission altitudes the frequency of the observed radiation
$\nu_{obs}$ is less than the plasma frequency $\nu_p$. We then conclude that
the radio emission properties are consistent with the theory of coherent
curvature radiation by charged solitons where the condition $\nu_{obs} <
\nu_{p}$ is satisfied. However, the differences that exist between core and
conal emission in their geometric locations within a pulse, polarization and
modulation properties are yet to be understood.

attracting increasing attention in recent years. Despite the significant
success, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods is
that they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of their
reliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings.
Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the base
clusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as an
individual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same base
clustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability of
clusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance the
consensus performance, especially in the case when there is no access to data
features or specific assumptions on data distribution. To address this, in this
paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven
cluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the
uncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in
the entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster
validity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is
presented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the
local diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are
further proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.

study how the local differential geometry of the web-structure affects the
global algebraic geometry of $X$. Under two geometric assumptions on the

determines the global algebraic geometry of $X$, up to generically finite

we show that if $X, X' \subset {\bf P}^N, \dim X' \geq 3,$ are two such Fano

a challenging task for stitching these images. The global transformation model
often provides dreadful stitching results, such as misalignments or projective
distortions, especially perspective distortion. To this end, we suggest a
perspective-preserving warping for image stitching, which spatially combines
local projective transformations and similarity transformation. By weighted
combination scheme, our approach gradually extrapolates the local projective
transformations of the overlapping regions into the non-overlapping regions,
and thus the final warping can smoothly change from projective to similarity.
The proposed method can provide satisfactory alignment accuracy as well as
reduce the projective distortions and maintain the multi-perspective view.
Experiments on a variety of challenging images confirm the efficiency of the
approach.

that with a hybrid MBA lattice, it is feasible for the HEPS to attain a natural
emittance of about 50 pm.rad, and meanwhile, realize a sufficient ring

Particularly, this study indicates that a rational combination of the PSO and

the number of source-to-target dependency paths that traverse each vertex, and
it identifies the core of a dependency network as the smallest set of vertices

bias of new modules to reuse intermediate modules of similar complexity instead
of connecting directly to sources or low complexity modules. We have applied
the proposed framework in a diverse set of dependency networks from

and two prominent peaks close to the 176 day first sub harmonic of Mercury
periodicity. To confirm that the peaks arise as sidebands we band pass filter
the sunspot area record to isolate the 88 and 176 day components of sunspot
area. The components occur in episodes of duration from 1.5 to 4 years, with
successive episodes usually overlapping in time but, for significant intervals
in the record, the episodes were discrete, i.e. not overlapping. The time
variation of the components was compared with the time variation of the tidal
effect of Mercury. We were able to show that whenever episodes were discrete
the component of sunspot area during the episode was either in-phase or in
anti-phase with the Mercury tidal effect. We interpret this as indicating a
connection between planetary motion and sunspot emergence. When several
discrete episodes of the components occurred during a solar cycle the spectrum
of sunspot area during that solar cycle exhibited periodicities at sidebands to
the 88 day or 176 day periods, the periodicity of the sidebands depending on
the duration of the episodes. A simple model based on amplitude modulation of

$a$ suspended in symmetric, univalent electrolyte solution, with
ideally-polarizable interface but without significant $\zeta$-potential. We
then use this solution to derive the dielectric response of a dilute random
suspension of such spheres, with volume fraction $f\ll1$, within the
Maxwell-Garnett Effective Medium Approximation. Surprisingly, we discover a
huge dielectric enhancement in this bare essential model of dielectric
responses of solids in electrolyte solution: at low frequency $\omega\tau_D \ll
(\lambda/a) / (\sigma_w / \sigma_s+1/2)$, the real part of the effective
dielectric constant of the mixture is $1-(3f/2)+(9f/4)(a/\lambda)$. Here
$\sigma_{w/s}$ is the conductivity of the electrolyte solution/solids,
$\lambda$ is the Debye screening length in the solution, $\tau_D=\lambda^2/D$
is the standard time scale of diffusion and $D$ is the ion diffusion
coefficient. As $\lambda$ is of the order nm even for dilute electrolyte
solution, even for sub-mm spheres and low volume fraction $f=0.05$ the huge
geometric factor $a/\lambda$ implies an over $10^4$-fold enhancement.
Furthermore, we show that this enhancement produces a significant low frequency
($\omega\tau_D\ll1$) phase shift $\tan\theta = \mathrm{Re}~ \epsilon(\omega) /
\mathrm{Im} ~\epsilon(\omega)$ in a simple impedance measurement of the
mixture, which is usually negligible in pure electrolyte solution. The phase
shift has a scale-invariant maximum
$\tan\theta_{\mathrm{max}}=(9/4)f/(2\sigma_w/\sigma_s+1)$ at
$\omega_{\mathrm{max}}=(2D/\lambda a)/(2\sigma_w/\sigma_s+1)$. We provide a
physical picture of the enhancement from an accumulation of charges in a thin

predicting the evolution in time of a evolutionary system governed by a system
of differential equations. If some of the parameters of the governing equations
are unknowns, it is possible to organize the calculations so as to estimate
them while following the evolution of the system in time. The underlying
assumption in the approach that we present is that all unknowns are modelled as
random variables, where the randomness is an indication of the uncertainty of
their values rather than an intrinsic property of the quantities. Consequently,
the states of the system and the parameters are described in probabilistic
terms by their density, often in the form of representative samples. This
approach is particularly attractive in the context of parameter estimation
inverse problems, because the statistical formulation naturally provides a
means of assessing the uncertainty in the solution via the spread of the
distribution. The computational efficiency of the underlying sampling technique
is crucial for the success of the method, because the accuracy of the solution
depends on the ability to produce representative samples from the distribution
of the unknown parameters. In this paper LMM PF is tested on a skeletal muscle
metabolism problem, which was previously treated within the Ensemble Kalman
filtering framework. Here numerical evidences are used to highlight the
correlation between the main sources of errors and the influence of the linera
multistep method adopted. Finally, we analyzed the effect of replacing LMM with
Runge-Kutta class integration methods for supporting the PF technique.

measuring these interactions in well-defined systems. This study focuses on
2-butanol, the simplest aliphatic chiral alcohol. 2-butanol shows interesting
properties as a chiral modifier of surface chemistry, however, its mode of
action is not fully understood. In order to probe its surface properties we
employed high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT simulations. We
found a surprisingly rich degree of enantiospecific adsorption, association,
chiral cluster growth and ultimately long range, highly ordered chiral
templating. Firstly, the chiral molecules acquire a second chiral center when
adsorbed to the surface via dative bonding of one of the oxygen atom lone
pairs. This interaction is controlled via the molecule's intrinsic chiral
center leading to monomers of like chirality, at both chiral centers, adsorbed
on the surface. The monomers then associate into tetramers via a cyclical
network of hydrogen bonds with an opposite chirality at the oxygen atom. The
evolution of these square units is surprising given that the underlying surface
has a hexagonal symmetry. Our DFT calculations reveal that the tetramers are
able to associate with each other by weaker van der Waals interactions and
tessellate in an extended square network. Our data reveals that the chirality
of a simple alcohol can be transferred to its surface binding geometry, drive
the directionality of hydrogen bonds and ultimately extended structure.
Furthermore, this study provides the first microscopic insight into the surface
properties of this important chiral modifier and provides a well-defined system
for studying the network's enantioselective interaction with other molecules.

similar values of the symmetry energy slope parameter at saturation density
$L$, and pertaining to different families, yield a greater-than-expected spread

the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm eff}$, determined by using the
nucleon density profiles of the finite nucleus and the density derivative
$S^\prime(\rho)$ of the symmetry energy starting from about saturation density
up to low densities typical of the surface of nuclei, seems to account for the
spread in the neutron-skin thickness for the models with similar $L$. The
differences in the values of $L_{\rm eff}$ are mainly due to the small
differences in the nucleon density distributions of heavy nuclei in the surface

$\mathbf{P}$ does not belong to the model, its risk involves an additional bias
term proportional to the distance between $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathscr{Q}$,
whatever the true distribution $\mathbf{P}$. From this point of view, this new
version of $\rho$-estimators improves upon the previous one described in
Baraud, Birg\'e and Sart (2017) which required that $\mathbf{P}$ be absolutely
continuous with respect to some known reference measure. Further additional
improvements have been brought as compared to the former construction. In
particular, it provides a very general treatment of the regression framework
with random design as well as a computationally tractable procedure for
aggregating estimators. We also give some conditions for the Maximum Likelihood
Estimator to be a $\rho$-estimator. Finally, we consider the situation where
the Statistician has at disposal many different models and we build a penalized
version of the $\rho$-estimator for model selection and adaptation purposes. In
the regression setting, this penalized estimator not only allows to estimate
the regression function but also the distribution of the errors.

important as it can provide constraints on transport in protoplanetary disks
and on the formation location of planets. However, constraining the internal
structure of low-mass planets from transit measurements is known to be a
degenerate problem. Using planetary structure and evolution models, we show how
observations of transiting planets can be used to constrain their internal
composition, in particular the amount of volatiles in the planetary interior,
and consequently the amount of gas (defined in this paper to be only H and He)
that the planet harbors. We show for low-mass gas-poor planets that are located
close to their central star that assuming evaporation has efficiently removed
the entire gas envelope, it is possible to constrain the volatile fraction of
close-in transiting planets. We illustrate this method on the example of 55 Cnc
e and show that under the assumption of the absence of gas, the measured mass
and radius imply at least 20 % of volatiles in the interior. For planets at
larger distances, we show that the observation of transiting planets at
different evolutionary ages can be used to set statistical constraints on the
volatile content of planets. These results can be used in the context of future
missions like PLATO to better understand the internal composition of planets.

freedom (besides the matter perfect fluid) are two transverse vector
perturbations, one longitudinal scalar, and two tensor polarizations. The
Lagrangians associated with intrinsic vector modes neither affect the
background equations of motion nor the second-order action of tensor
perturbations, but they do give rise to non-trivial modifications to the
no-ghost condition of vector perturbations and to the propagation speeds of
vector and scalar perturbations. We derive the effective gravitational coupling
$G_{\rm eff}$ with matter density perturbations under a quasi-static
approximation on scales deep inside the sound horizon. We find that the
existence of intrinsic vector modes allows a possibility for reducing $G_{\rm
eff}$. In fact, within the parameter space, $G_{\rm eff}$ can be even smaller
than the Newton gravitational constant $G$ at the late cosmological epoch, with
a peculiar phantom dark energy equation of state (without ghosts). The
modifications to the slip parameter $\eta$ and the evolution of growth rate
$f\sigma_8$ are discussed as well. Thus, dark energy models in the framework of
generalized Proca theories can be observationally distinguished from the
$\Lambda$CDM model according to both cosmic growth and expansion history.
Furthermore, we study the evolution of vector perturbations and show that
outside the vector sound horizon the perturbations are nearly frozen and start

opportunistic one-bit feedback has been used in fading broadcast channels to
select only one user for transmission. In contrast, the considered NOMA scheme
adopts superposition coding to serve all users simultaneously in order to
improve user fairness. A closed-form expression for the common outage
probability (COP) is derived, along with the optimal diversity gains under two
types of power constraints. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the diversity
gain under a long-term power constraint is twice as large as that under a
short-term power constraint. Furthermore, we study dynamic power allocation
optimization for minimizing the COP, based on one-bit CSI feedback. This
problem is challenging since the objective function is non-convex; however,
under the short-term power constraint, we demonstrate that the original problem
can be transformed into a set of convex problems. Under the long-term power
constraint, an asymptotically optimal solution is obtained for high

formalisms such as quantum circuits, several high-level languages/calculi have
been recently proposed aiming at structured quantum programming. The current
work contributes to the semantical study of such languages by providing
interaction-based semantics of a functional quantum programming language; the
latter is, much like Selinger and Valiron's, based on linear lambda calculus
and equipped with features like the ! modality and recursion. The proposed
denotational model is the first one that supports the full features of a
quantum functional programming language; we prove adequacy of our semantics.
The construction of our model is by a series of existing techniques taken from
the semantics of classical computation as well as from process theory. The most
notable among them is Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI), categorically
formulated by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott. The mathematical genericity of
these techniques---largely due to their categorical formulation---is exploited
for our move from classical to quantum.

recurrence in a one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE).
That recurrence can be considered as a result of the nonlinear development of
modulation instability. All known exact localized solitons-type solutions
describing propagation on the background of the modulationally unstable
condensate show the recurrence to the condensate state after its interaction
with solitons. The condensate state locally recovers its original form with the
same amplitude but a different phase after soliton leave its initial region.
This is the analog of the FPU recurrence for the NLSE. Based on the
integrability of the NLSE, we demonstrate that the FPU recurrence takes place
not only for condensate but for more general solution in the form of the
cnoidal wave. This solution is periodic in space and can be represented as a
solitonic lattice. That lattice reduces to isolated soliton solution in the
limit of large distance between solitons. The lattice transforms into the
condensate in the opposite limit of dense soliton packing. The cnoidal wave is
also modulationally unstable due to soliton overlapping. This instability at
the linear stage does not provide the cnoidal wave recurrence. The recurrence
happens at the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability. From the
practical point of view the latter property is very important, especially for
the fiber communication systems which use soliton as an information carrier.

This model has very few ingredients, any of which can be associated to
observational data and thus be efficiently assessed. By applying this model to
a very high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, we predict a number of
galaxy properties that are a very good match to relevant observational data.
Namely, for both centrals and satellites, the galaxy stellar mass function
(SMF) up to redshift $z\simeq4$ and the conditional stellar mass functions
(CSMF) in the local universe are in good agreement with observations. In
addition, the 2-point correlation is well predicted in the different stellar
mass ranges explored by our model. Furthermore, after applying stellar
population synthesis models to our stellar composition as a function of
redshift, we find that the luminosity functions in $^{0.1}u$, $^{0.1}g$,
$^{0.1}r$, $^{0.1}i$ and $^{0.1}z$ bands agree quite well with the SDSS
observational results down to an absolute magnitude at about -17.0. The SDSS
conditional luminosity functions (CLF) itself is predicted well. Finally, the
cold gas is derived from the star formation rate (SFR) to predict the HI gas
mass within each mock galaxy. We find a remarkably good match to observed
HI-to-stellar mass ratios. These features ensure that such galaxy/gas catalogs
can be used to generate reliable mock redshift surveys.

for HD 100546 are derived from archival spectra. Upper limits on HD emission
from HD 100546 place an upper limit on the total disk mass of

warm Herbig disk is at most moderately depleted compared to the interstellar
medium, with [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}=(0.1-1.5)\times 10^{-4}$. HD 100546 itself is a
$\lambda\,$Bo\""{o}tis star, with solar abundances of C and O but a strong
depletion of rock-forming elements. In the gas of the T Tauri disk TW Hya, both
C and O are strongly underabundant, with [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}=(0.2-5.0)\times
10^{-6}$ and C/O${>}1$. We discuss evidence that the gas-phase C and O
abundances are high in the warm inner regions of both disks. Our analytical
model, including vertical mixing and a grain size distribution, reproduces the
observed [C]/[H]$_{\rm gas}$ in the outer disk of TW Hya and allows to make

flows in inclined channels is studied with respect to all wavenumber
perturbations. The main objective is to predict parameter regions in which
stable stratified configuration in inclined channels exists. Up to three
distinct base states with different holdups exist in inclined flows, so that
the stability analysis has to be carried out for each branch separately.
Special attention is paid to the multiple solution regions to reveal the
feasibility of non-unique stable stratified configurations in inclined
channels. The stability boundaries of each branch of steady state solutions are
presented on the flow pattern map and are accompanied by critical wavenumbers
and spatial profiles of the most unstable perturbations. Instabilities of
different nature are visualized by streamlines of the neutrally stable
perturbed flows, consisting of the critical perturbation superimposed on the
base flow. The present analysis confirms the existence of two stable stratified
flow configurations in a region of low flow rates in countercurrent
liquid-liquid flows. These configurations become unstable with respect to shear
mode of instability. It was revealed that in slightly upward inclined flows the
lower and middle solutions for the holdup are stable in a part of the triple
solution region, while the upper solution is always unstable. In the case of
downward flows, in the triple solution region, none of the solutions are stable
with respect to short-wave perturbations. These flows are stable only in the
single solution region at low flow rates of the heavy phase, where long-wave
perturbations are the most unstable ones.

  The different forms of (backward) abstract slicing are added to an existing

is a generalization of traditional slicing, since traditional slicing (dealing
with syntactic dependencies) is generalized by (semantic) non-abstract forms of
slicing, which are actually equivalent to an abstract form where the identity
abstraction is performed on data.
  Sound algorithms for computing abstract dependencies and a systematic

demonstrate that the worst-case growth of dimension in complete games is at
least linear. In this paper, using a novel technique of Kurz and Napel (2016),
we demonstrate that the worst-case growth of dimension in complete simple games
is exponential in the number of players.

a countable set of $2 \times 2$ matrices whose coefficients are the so-called
transmission and reflection coefficients. It is shown that the reflection
coefficients are nothing but generalized Weyl-Titchmarsh functions associated
with the radial ODE. Using a novel multivariable version of the Complex Angular

microstates into something about as transparent as the hydrogen atom was in the

of the evolution laws of these microstates, linking them to perturbative
quantum field theory, in the background of the Schwarzschild metric. Three
pieces of insight are obtained: One, we learn how the gravitational back
reaction, whose dominant component can be calculated exactly, turns particles
entering the hole, into particles leaving it, by exchanging the momentum- and
position operators; two, we find out how this effect removes firewalls, both on
the future and the past event horizon, and three, we discover that the presence
of region II in the Penrose diagram forces a topological twist in the
background metric, culminating in antipodal identification. Although a cut-off
is required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice,
the effect of such a cut-off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion is
applied. This expansion then reveals exactly how antipodal identification
restores unitarity - for each partial wave separately. We expect that these
ideas will provide new insights in some highly non-trivial topological

allows to render haptic feedback to the human fingers. Its design, however,
restricts its usability for teleoperation through a limited control bandwidth

achievable contact stiffness and feedback gain magnitudes in haptic rendering.
Moreover, the system prohibits simple adaption of its controller
implementation. In this paper, the ExHand Box is presented, a newly designed
back-end to widen the CyberGrasp's bandwidth restrictions and to open it up for
fully customized controller implementations. The ExHand Box provides a new
computer, interface electronics and motor controllers for the otherwise
unmodified CyberGlove and CyberGrasp hand systems. The loop frequency of the
new system can be freely varied up to 2 kHz and custom controllers can be
implemented through an automatic code generation interface. System performance
identification experiments are presented that demonstrate improved behavior in
hard contact situations over a range of sampling periods. Maximum contact
stiffnesses of up to 50kN/m in a stable condition are demonstrated, which is
significantly higher than what could be achieved with the non-customized
original system version. Moreover, a bilateral control experiment is conducted
to demonstrate the new system's usability for generic teleoperation research.
In this experiment a raycasting algorithm is introduced for pre-contact
detection in order to compensate for high delay and jitter communication links
between master and slave as they appear in an Ethernet network. It is
demonstrated that the contact stiffness can be maintained in the order of
magnitude of the system performance identification with a demonstrated
stiffness of 41kN/m in a stable condition.

that the progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm and the approximate cycle
extrinsic message degree (ACE) constrained PEG algorithm are unified into one
integrated algorithm, called the metric-constrained PEG algorithm (M-PEGA).
Then, as an improvement for the M-PEGA, the multi-edge metric-constrained PEG
algorithm (MM-PEGA) is proposed based on two new concepts, the multi-edge local
girth and the edge-trials. The MM-PEGA with the edge-trials, say a positive
integer $r$, is called the $r$-edge M-PEGA, which constructs each edge of the
non-quasi-cyclic (non-QC) LDPC code graph through selecting a check node whose
$r$-edge local girth is optimal. In addition, to design the QC-LDPC codes with
any predefined valid design parameters, as well as to detect and even to avoid
generating the undetectable cycles in the QC-LDPC codes designed by the QC-PEG
algorithm, the multi-edge metric constrained QC-PEG algorithm (MM-QC-PEGA) is
proposed lastly. It is verified by the simulation results that increasing the
edge-trials of the MM-PEGA/MM-QC-PEGA is expected to have a positive effect on
the cycle-structures and the error performances of the LDPC codes designed by
the MM-PEGA/MM-QC-PEGA.

Nevertheless, clear understanding for the effects of A and X on the optical
transition has been lacking. Here, we present universal rules that allow the
unified interpretation of the optical absorption in various hybrid perovskites.
In particular, we find that the influence of the A-site cation on the light
absorption is rather significant and the absorption coefficient (alpha) reduces
to half when CH3NH3+ is replaced with HC(NH2)2+ in the APbI3 system. Our
density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce all of the fine
absorption features observed in HC(NH2)2PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, allowing the
unique assignment of the interband transitions in the Brillouin zone. In
contrast to general understanding that the A-site cation involves weakly in the
optical process, our theoretical calculations reveal that the center cation
plays a critical role in the interband transition and the absorption strength
in the visible region is modified by the strong A-X interaction. Furthermore,
our systematic analyses show that the variation of the absorption spectrum with
X can be described simply by the well-known sum rule. The universal rules
established in this study explain the large reduction of alpha in HC(NH2)2PbI3
and predict CsPbI3 as the highest alpha material.

accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays. The maximum energy to which cosmic
rays can be accelerated depends on the structure of magnetic turbulence near
the shock but recent theoretical advances indicate that relativistic shocks are
probably unable to accelerate particles to energies much larger than a PeV. We
study the hotspots of powerful radiogalaxies, where electrons accelerated at
the termination shock emit synchrotron radiation. The turnover of the
synchrotron spectrum is typically observed between infrared and optical
frequencies, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons
accelerated at the shock is < TeV for a canonical magnetic field of ~100 micro
Gauss. Based on theoretical considerations we show that this maximum energy
cannot be constrained by synchrotron losses as usually assumed, unless the jet
density is unreasonably large and most of the jet upstream energy goes to
non-thermal particles. We test this result by considering a sample of hotspots
observed with high spatial resolution at radio, infrared and optical
wavelengths.

ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal bilayers and exploitation of it for
magnetization switching using an in-plane current. As the spin-orbit torque is
inversely proportional to the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer, sizable
effect has only been realized in bilayers with an ultrathin ferromagnetic
layer. Here we demonstrate that, by stacking ultrathin Pt and FeMn alternately,
both ferromagnetic properties and current induced spin-orbit torque can be
achieved in FeMn/Pt multilayers without any constraint on its total thickness.
The critical behavior of these multilayers follows closely three-dimensional
Heisenberg model with a finite Curie temperature distribution. The spin torque
effective field is about 4 times larger than that of NiFe/Pt bilayer with a
same equivalent NiFe thickness. The self-current generated spin torque is able
to switch the magnetization reversibly without the need for an external field
or a thick heavy metal layer. The removal of both thickness constraint and
necessity of using an adjacent heavy metal layer opens new possibilities for
exploiting spin-orbit torque for practical applications.

the Chinese language. In this research, we employed a linguistic approach to
explore popular discourses on Guanxi. Although sharing the same Confucian
roots, Chinese communities inside and outside Mainland China have undergone
different historical trajectories. Hence, we took a comparative approach to
examine guanxi in Mainland China and in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (TW-HK-M).
Comparing guanxi discourses in two Chinese societies aims at revealing the
divergence of guanxi culture. The data for this research were collected on
Twitter over a three-week period by searching tweets containing guanxi written
in Simplified Chinese characters and in Traditional Chinese characters. After
building, visualising, and conducting community detection on both semantic
networks, two guanxi discourses were then compared in terms of their major
concept sub-communities. This research aims at addressing two questions: Has
the meaning of guanxi transformed in contemporary Chinese societies? And how do
different socio-economic configurations affect the practice of guanxi? Results
suggest that guanxi in interpersonal relationships has adapted to a new family
structure in both Chinese societies. In addition, the practice of guanxi in
business varies in Mainland China and in TW-HK-M. Furthermore, an extended
domain was identified where guanxi is used in a macro-level discussion of state
relations. Network representations of the guanxi discourses enabled reification
of the concept and shed lights on the understanding of social connections and
social orders in contemporary China.

condensate motion. In this case we compute this typical time-scale and
characterize the law of the (properly rescaled) limiting process. If the
restriction of the random walk to $S_\star$ has several connected components, a

entanglement decays due to perturbations, corrupting quantum links which cannot

tomography itself is not possible without a working link. Here we overcome this
problem with a robust approach to characterising quantum channels by means of
classical light. Using free-space communication in a turbulent atmosphere as an
example, we show that the state evolution of classically entangled degrees of

new physical insights into the notion of classical entanglement. The analysis
of quantum channels by means of classical light in real time unravels
stochastic dynamics in terms of pure state trajectories and thus enables
precise quantum error-correction in short and long haul optical communication,

used in simulation of crowd evacuation in the past decade. A problem, however,
is that the testing results of the model were not explained in consistency with
the psychological findings, resulting in misunderstanding of the model by
psychologists. This paper will bridge the gap between psychological studies and
physical explanation about this model. We reinterpret this physics-based model
from a psychological perspective, clarifying that the model is consistent with
psychological theories on stress, including time-related stress and
interpersonal stress. Based on the conception of stress, we renew the model at
both micro-and-macro level, referring to multi-agent simulation in a
microscopic sense and fluid-based analysis in a macroscopic sense. The
cognition and behavior of individual agents are critically modeled as response
to environmental stimuli. Existing simulation results such as faster-is-slower
effect will be reinterpreted by Yerkes-Dodson law, and herding and grouping
effect as well as oscillation phenomenon are further discussed for pedestrian
crowd. In brief the social-force model exhibits a bridge between the physics
laws and psychological principles regarding crowd motion, and this paper will
renew and reinterpret the model on the foundation of psychological studies.

cosmological constant $\Lambda$, using the Newman-Penrose formalism. Our
approach is based exclusively on the physical spacetime, i.e. we do not
explicitly deal with conformal rescaling nor the conformal spacetime. By
investigating the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in spherical coordinates,
we subsequently stipulate the fall-offs of the null tetrad and spin
coefficients for asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes such that the terms which
would give rise to the Bondi mass-loss due to energy carried by gravitational
radiation (i.e. involving $\sigma^o$) must be non-zero. After solving the
vacuum Newman-Penrose equations asymptotically, we propose a generalisation to
the Bondi mass involving $\Lambda$ and obtain a positive-definite mass-loss
formula by integrating the Bianchi identity involving $D'\Psi_2$ over a compact
2-surface on $\mathcal{I}$. Whilst our original intention was to study
asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, the use of spherical coordinates implies
that this readily applies for $\Lambda<0$, and yields exactly the known
asymptotically flat spacetimes when $\Lambda=0$. In other words, our asymptotic
vacuum solutions with $\Lambda\neq0$ reduce smoothly to those where
$\Lambda=0$, in spite of the distinct characters of $\mathcal{I}$ being
spacelike, timelike and null for de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski,
respectively. Unlike for $\Lambda=0$ where no incoming radiation corresponds to
setting $\Psi^o_0=0$ on some initial null hypersurface, for $\Lambda\neq0$, no
incoming radiation requires $\Psi^o_0=0$ everywhere.

on the linear realization of chiral symmetry $SU(N_f)_L \times SU(N_f)_R$, with
(pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons as degrees of freedom. In this paper,
we study the low-energy limit of the eLSM for $N_f=2$ flavors by integrating
out all fields except for the pions, the (pseudo-)Nambu--Goldstone bosons of
chiral symmetry breaking. We only keep terms entering at tree level and up to
fourth order in powers of derivatives of the pion fields. Up to this order,
there are four low-energy coupling constants in the resulting low-energy
effective action. We show that the latter is formally identical to Chiral
Perturbation Theory (ChPT), after choosing a representative for the coset space
generated by chiral symmetry breaking and expanding up to fourth order in
powers of derivatives of the pion fields. Two of the low-energy coupling
constants of the eLSM are uniquely determined by a fit to hadron masses and
decay widths. We find that their tree-level values are in reasonable agreement
with the corresponding low-energy coupling constants of ChPT. The other two
low-energy coupling constants are functions of parameters that can in principle
be determined by $\pi\pi$ scattering, which has not yet been studied within the
eLSM. Therefore, we use the respective values from ChPT to make a prediction
for the values of these parameters in the eLSM Lagrangian.

observational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the
peculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On
large-scales the critical points, where the first derivative of the
gravitational potential vanishes, can easily be identified using the density
field and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational
potential. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions
are stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions.
Furthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially
minimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of
vanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging
indiscriminately using the full data sets, as is the common approach.

induced by a spontaneous breaking of the time-reversal symmetry. Using the
density-matrix renormalization group allows us to show that the excitation
energy gap closes exponentially causing a quasi-degenerate ground state. The
two degenerate ground states are connected by the time-reversal symmetry which
manifests itself in an alternating complex phase of the long-range correlation
function. The quantum phase transition to the twisted superfluid is driven by
pair tunneling processes in an extended Bose-Hubbard model. The phase
boundaries of several other phases are discussed including a supersolid, a pair
superfluid, and a pair supersolid phase as well as a highly unconventional Mott
insulator with a degenerate ground state and a staggered pair correlation
function.

galaxy has a well-defined radius beyond which little star formation occurs and
the disk light appears both azimuthally smooth and red in color, suggestive of
old, well-mixed stellar populations. Given the lack of ongoing star formation
or blue stellar populations in these galaxies' outer disks, the most likely
mechanisms for their formation are dynamical processes such as disk heating or
radial migration, rather than inside-out growth of the disks. This is also
implied by the similarity in outer disk properties despite each galaxy showing
distinct levels of environmental influence, from a purely isolated galaxy (M94)
to one experiencing weak tidal perturbations from its satellite galaxies (M106)
to a galaxy recovering from a recent merger (M64), suggesting that a variety of
evolutionary histories can yield similar outer disk structure. While this
suggests a common secular mechanism for outer disk formation, the large extent
of these smooth, red stellar populations---which reach several disk
scalelengths beyond the galaxies' spiral structure---may challenge models of

material. The structural stability of TCP phases in multi-component
transition-metal alloys may be rationalised in terms of the average
valence-electron count $\bar{N}$ and the composition-dependent relative
volume-difference $\overline{\Delta V/V}$. We elucidate the interplay of these
factors by comparing density-functional theory calculations to an empirical
structure map based on experimental data. In particular, we calculate the heat
of formation for the TCP phases A15, C14, C15, C36, $\chi$, $\mu$, and $\sigma$
for all possible binary occupations of the Wyckoff positions. We discuss the
isovalent systems V/Nb-Ta to highlight the role of atomic-size difference and
observe the expected stabilisation of C14/C15/C36/$\mu$ by $\overline{\Delta
V/V}$ at $\Delta N=0$ in V-Ta. In the systems V/Nb-Re, we focus on the
well-known trend of A15$- \sigma - \chi$ stability with increasing $\bar{N}$
and show that the influence of $\overline{\Delta V/V}$ is too weak to stabilise
C14/C15/C36/$\mu$ in Nb-Re. As an example for a significant influence of both
$\bar{N}$ and $\overline{\Delta V/V}$, we also consider the systems Cr/Mo-Co.
Here the sequence A15$- \sigma - \chi$ is observed in both systems but in Mo-Co
the large size-mismatch stabilises C14/C15/C36/$\mu$. We also include V/Nb-Co
that cover the entire valence range of TCP stability and also show the
stabilisation of C14/C15/C36/$\mu$. Moreover, the combination of a large volume
difference with a large mismatch in valence-electron count reduces the
stability of the A15/$\sigma$/$\chi$ phases in Nb-Co as compared to V-Co. By
comparison to non-magnetic calculations we also find that magnetism is of minor
importance for the structural stability of TCP phases in Cr/Mo-Co and in

this hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions of

Bose gases supporting Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC), their algebraic
structures and implications can be analyzed in detail. Both ground states are
generalized squeezed coherent states saturating a generalized Heisenberg
uncertainty relation, and they acquire quantized Berry phases when the
corresponding systems are transported along a closed path in their parameter
spaces. While the Berry phase of the BCS ground state depends on the total
particle number, the Berry phase of the BEC ground state depends only on the
particles outside the BEC. The Berry phases are associated with magnetic
monopoles in the parameter spaces and we found that the Dirac quantization
condition is satisfied. Moreover, both ground states are entangled states of
the fermion or boson quanta and we found the entanglement entropy quantifying
the internal correlations. A fixed particle-number approach of fermionic
superfluids does not saturate the generalized uncertainty relation, exhibits
internal entanglement, and gives corresponding Berry phase. In addition, the
algebraic structures of the ground states can be classified by the $q$-deformed
Hopf algebra, $\bigoplus_{\mathbf{k}}h_{q_{\mathbf{k}}}(1)$ for bosons and
$q$-deformed Hopf superalgebra $\bigoplus_{\mathbf{k}}h_{q_{\mathbf{k}}}(1|1)$

(ND4)2FeCl5D2O, a molecular compound that exhibits magnetically induced
ferroelectricity. This material exhibits two successive magnetic transitions on
cooling: a long-range order transition to an incommensurate (IC) collinear
sinusoidal spin state at TN=7.3 K, followed by a second transition to an IC
cycloidal spin state at TFE=6.8 K, the later of which is accompanied by
spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. The cycloid structure is strongly
distorted by spin-lattice coupling as evidenced by the observations of both odd
and even higher-order harmonics associated with the cycloid wave vector, and a
weak commensurate phase that coexists with the IC phase. The appearance of the
2nd-order harmonic coincides with the onset of the electric polarization,
thereby providing unambiguous evidence that the induced electric polarization
is mediated by the spin-lattice interaction. Our results for this system, in
which the orbital angular momentum is expected to be quenched, are remarkably
similar to those of the prototypical TbMnO3, in which the magnetoelectric
effect is attributed to spin-orbit coupling.

iso-electronic series, $Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}$, is studied within the GGA (and
spin-orbit coupled GGA) plus DMFT formalism using the hybridization expansion
of continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo solver. While the local dynamical
correlations make $Sr_{2}RuO_{4}$ a Hund's metal, they drive $Ca_{2}RuO_{4}$ to
a Mott insulating ground state. We study the dynamic and static single-particle
and local irreducible vertex-corrected two-particle responses at three
different points ($x = 2.0, 0.5, 0.0$) to understand the anomalous cross-over
from Hund's metal ($x = 2.0 $) to a Mott insulator ($x = 0 $) and find that a
structural distortion is likely to be responsible for the cross-over. Further,
dynamical correlations reveal that the band-width ($W$) of the Hund's metal is
larger than its effective local Hubbard $U$, and a finite Hund's coupling
$J_{H}$ helps it remain in a bad metallic and nearly spin-frozen state over a
large temperature range. $Ca_{2}RuO_{4}$, on the other hand, is intrinsically
driven to the proximity of a Mott transition due to narrowing of band width
($U/W > 1.5$), though its finite temperature excitations indicate bad
metallicity. We show that there is a critical end point of second-order
structural transition at $x = 0.5$, where spin fluctuations become critically
singular and follow the exact scaling of conformally invariant boundary field
theory. The critical end point of quasi-$3D$ nature is associated with an
effective dimensional cross-over between the $x = 2.0$ and $x=0.0$ quasi-$2D$
structures. Finally we draw a modified magnetic phase diagram of the material,
showing a fan-like region starting from the quantum critical end point at $x =
0.5.$

Inspired by the symmetry and pairing energy of the Weizsacker mass formula we
obtain the free energy of fermions (nucleons) and bosons (alphas and deuterons)
using Landau's free energy approach. We confirm previously obtained results for
fermions and show that the free energy for alpha particles is negative and very
close to the free energy for ideal Bose gases. Deuterons behave more similarly
to fermions (positive free energy) rather than bosons. This is due to their low
binding energy, which makes them very 'fragile', i.e., easily formed and
destroyed. We show that the {\alpha}-particle fraction is dominant at all
temperatures and densities explored in this work. This is consistent with their
negative free energy, which favors clusterization of nuclear matter into
{\alpha}-particles at subsaturation densities and finite temperatures. The role
of finite open systems and Coulomb repulsion is addressed.

distributions with exponents greater than $2$. Real networks, however, can
demonstrate essentially more heavy-tailed degree distributions. We explore two
models of scale-free equilibrium networks that have the degree distribution
exponent $\gamma = 1$, $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$. Such degree distributions can
be identified in empirical data only if the mean degree of a network is
sufficiently high. Our models exploit a rewiring mechanism. They are local in
the sense that no knowledge of the network structure, apart from the immediate
neighbourhood of the vertices, is required. These models generate uncorrelated
networks in the infinite size limit, where they are solved explicitly. We
investigate finite size effects by the use of simulations. We find that both
models exhibit disassortative degree-degree correlations for finite network
sizes. In addition, we observe a markedly degree-dependent clustering in the
finite networks. We indicate a real-world network with a similar degree
distribution.

probability distribution describing the orientations of liquid crystal monomers

entropy assumption on the distribution of bond angles in an observed chain. The
chain energy's fourth order Taylor expansion is also given, which couples to
the second and fourth moments of the nematic distribution function only.

breaking of this conformal invariance / scale invariance induces general

that the corresponding field equations of the theory have the linearly rising
potential, which naturally possesses asymptotic freedom and color confinement
properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Solutions to the neutrino mass and
dark energy problems come as free gifts of this formulation. This approach
provides a strong gravity basis for the unification of quantum Yang-Mills
