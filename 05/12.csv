boundary is presented. Palatini's gravity appears as a gauge theory satisfying
a constraint in a certain topological limit. This approach allows the
consideration of non-trivial topological situations. The multisymplectic
framework for first-order covariant Hamiltonian field theories on manifolds
with boundary, developed in [Ib15], enables analysis of the system at the
boundary. The reduced phase space of the system is determined to be a
symplectic manifold with a distinguished isotropic submanifold corresponding to
the boundary data of the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

well as kpc scales. These jets supposedly possess relativistic motion and are
oriented close to the line of sight of the observer and accordingly the
relativistic Doppler beaming makes them look much brighter than they really are
in their respective rest-frames. The flux boosting due to the relativistic
beaming is a very sensitive factor of the jet orientation angle, as seen by the
observer. Quite often large bends are seen in these jets, with misalignments
being $90^\circ$ or more and might imply a change in the orientation angle that
could cause a large change in the relativistic beaming factor. Such large bends
should show high contrasts in the brightness of the jets, before and after the
misalignments, if relativistic beaming does play an important role in these
jets. It needs to be kept in mind that sometimes a small intrinsic change in
the jet angle might appear as a much larger misalignment due to the geometrical
projection effects, especially when seen close to the line of sight. Of course
what really matters is the final orientation angle of the jet with respect to
the observer's line of sight. Taking the geometrical projection effects
properly into account, we calculate the consequences of the presumed
relativistic beaming and demonstrate that there ought to be large brightness
ratios in jets before and after the observed misalignments.

Universe and the laws of gravity. We study in this work changes to tensor-mode
perturbations (TMPs) that can arise in various proposed modified gravity (MG)
theories. These include additional friction effects, nonstandard dispersion
relations involving a massive graviton, a modified speed, and a small-scale
modification. We introduce a physically motivated parameterization of these
effects and use current available data to obtain exclusion regions in the
parameter spaces. Taking into account the foreground subtraction, we then
perform a forecast analysis focusing on tensor-mode MG parameters as
constrained by future experiments COrE, Stage-IV and PIXIE. For a fiducial
value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.01$, we find that an additional
friction of $3.5\sim4.5\%$ compared to GR will be detected at $3$-$\sigma$ by
these experiments, while a decrease in friction will be more difficult to
detect. The speed of gravitational waves needs to be by $5\sim15\%$ different
from the speed of light for detection. We find that the minimum detectable
graviton mass is about $7.8\sim9.7\times 10^{-33}$ eV, which is of the same
order of magnitude as the graviton mass that allows massive gravity theories to
produce cosmic acceleration. Finally, we study TMPs in MG during inflation
using our parameterization. We find that the tensor spectral index is related
to $r$ and the friction parameter $\nu_0$ by $n_T=-3\nu_0-r/8$. Assuming that
the friction parameter is unchanged throughout the history of the Universe and
is much larger than $r$, future experiments will be able to distinguish this MG
consistency relation from the standard inflation one, and thus can be used as a
further test of MG. In summary, TMPs and cosmic-microwave-background B-mode
polarization provide a complementary avenue to test gravity theories.

Software defined radio (SDR) techniques replace many of these analog components
with digital signal processing (DSP) on rapidly sampled signals. We demonstrate
that, generically, commercially available multi-channel SDRs are capable of
time and frequency metrology, outperforming purpose-built devices by as much as
an order-of-magnitude. For example, for signals at 10 MHz and 6 GHz, we observe
SDR time deviation noise floors of about 20 fs and 1 fs, respectively, in under
10 ms of averaging. Examining the other complex signal component, we find a
relative amplitude measurement instability of 3e-7 at 5 MHz. We discuss the
scalability of a SDR-based system for simultaneous measurement of many clocks.
SDR's frequency agility allows for comparison of oscillators at widely
different frequencies. We demonstrate a novel and extreme example with optical
clock frequencies differing by many terahertz: using a femtosecond-laser
frequency comb and SDR, we show femtosecond-level time comparisons of
ultra-stable lasers with zero measurement dead-time.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We combine the Planck CMB anisotropy
data in temperature with the low-multipole polarization data to fit LCDM models
with various parameterizations of the reionization history. We obtain a Thomson
optical depth tau=0.058 +/- 0.012 for the commonly adopted instantaneous
reionization model. This confirms, with only data from CMB anisotropies, the
low value suggested by combining Planck 2015 results with other data sets and
also reduces the uncertainties. We reconstruct the history of the ionization
fraction using either a symmetric or an asymmetric model for the transition
between the neutral and ionized phases. To determine better constraints on the
duration of the reionization process, we also make use of measurements of the
amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect using additional
information from the high resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole
Telescope experiments. The average redshift at which reionization occurs is
found to lie between z=7.8 and 8.8, depending on the model of reionization
adopted. Using kSZ constraints and a redshift-symmetric reionization model, we
find an upper limit to the width of the reionization period of Dz < 2.8. In all
cases, we find that the Universe is ionized at less than the 10% level at
redshifts above z~10. This suggests that an early onset of reionization is
strongly disfavoured by the Planck data. We show that this result also reduces
the tension between CMB-based analyses and constraints from other astrophysical
sources.

estimation more difficult. We present a novel approach for Bayesian estimation
of the Poisson process model parameters by reparameterising in terms of a

value of m that near-orthogonalises the parameters, which is achieved by
minimising the correlation between the asymptotic posterior distribution of the

order. In the case of metals and alloys, the liquid phase is the parent phase
of materials production. The conditions of the crystallization process control
the as-solidified material in its chemical and physical properties. Nucleation
initiates the crystallization of a liquid. It selects the crystallographic
phase, stable or meta-stable. Its detailed knowledge is therefore mandatory for
the design of materials. We present techniques of containerless processing for
nucleation studies of metals and alloys. We demonstrate the power of these
methods for crystal nucleation of stable solids but in particular also for
investigations of crystal nucleation of metastable solids at extreme
undercooling. This concerns the issue of heterogeneous versus homogeneous
nucleation and non-equilibrium conditions. The results are analyzed within
classical nucleation theory, where the activation energy of homogeneous
nucleation depends on the interfacial energy and the difference of Gibbs free
energies of solid and liquid. The interfacial energy acts as barrier for the
nucleation process. Its experimental determination is difficult in the case of
metals. In the second part of this work we therefore explore the use of
colloidal suspensions as models for the crystallization process. Their
nucleation process is observed in situ by optical techniques and ultra-small
angle X-ray diffraction using high intensity synchrotron radiation. It allows
an unambiguous discrimination of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation as
well as the determination of the interfacial free energy of the solid-liquid
interface. Our results are used to construct Turnbull plots of colloids, which
are discussed in relation to Turnbull plots of metals and support the
hypothesis that colloids are useful model systems to investigate crystal
nucleation.

distributed over the set of words of length $2n$ in which $n$ letters are $a$

uniformly at random among the letters of the current word. We obtain a concrete
characterization of the Doob-Martin boundary of this Markov chain. Writing
$N(u)$ for the number of letters $a$ (equivalently, $b$) in the finite word
$u$, we show that a sequence $(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of finite words
converges to a point in the boundary if, for an arbitrary word $v$, there is
convergence as $n$ tends to infinity of the probability that the selection of
$N(v)$ letters $a$ and $N(v)$ letters $b$ uniformly at random from $u_n$ and
maintaining their relative order results in $v$. We exhibit a bijective
correspondence between the points in the boundary and ergodic random total
orders on the set $\{a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots \}$ that have distributions

multiple-input multiple-output relay network, where an energy-constrained relay
harvests wireless power from the source information flow and can be further
aided by an energy flow (EF) in the form of a wireless power transfer at the
destination. However, the joint optimization of the relay matrix and the source
precoder for the energy-flow-assisted (EFA) and the non-EFA (NEFA) schemes is
intractable. The original rate maximization problem is transformed into an
equivalent weighted mean square error minimization problem and optimized
iteratively, where the global optimum of the nonconvex source precoder
subproblem is achieved by semidefinite relaxation and rank reduction. The
iterative algorithm finally converges. Then, the simplified EFA and NEFA
schemes are proposed based on channel diagonalization, such that the matrices
optimizations can be simplified to power optimizations. Closed-form solutions
can be achieved. Simulation results reveal that the EFA schemes can outperform
the NEFA schemes. Additionally, deploying more antennas at the relay increases
the dimension of the signal space at the relay. Exploiting the additional
dimension, the EF leakage in the information detecting block can be nearly
separated from the information signal, such that the EF leakage can be
amplified with a small coefficient.

organic semiconductor donor-acceptor blends impacts charge carrier motion,
interactions, and recombination behavior is a critical fundamental issue with a
particularly major impact on organic photovoltaic applications. In this study,
kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are used to numerically quantify the
complex bimolecular charge carrier recombination behavior in idealized
phase-separated blends. Recent KMC simulations have identified how the
encounter-limited bimolecular recombination rate in these blends deviates from
the often used Langevin model and have been used to construct the new power
mean mobility model. Here, we make a challenging but crucial expansion to this
work by determining the charge carrier concentration dependence of the
encounter-limited bimolecular recombination coefficient. In doing so, we find
that an accurate treatment of the long-range electrostatic interactions between
charge carriers is critical, and we further argue that many previous KMC
simulation studies have used a Coulomb cutoff radius that is too small, which
causes a significant overestimation of the recombination rate. To shed more
light on this issue, we determine the minimum cutoff radius required to reach
an accuracy of less than $\pm10\%$ as a function of the domain size and the
charge carrier concentration and then use this knowledge to accurately quantify
the charge carrier concentration dependence of the recombination rate. Using
these rigorous methods, we finally show that the parameters of the power mean
mobility model are determined by a newly identified dimensionless ratio of the
domain size to the average charge carrier separation distance.

favouring frustrated magnetism) characterizing this compound. We report here
the results of magnetization, heat-capacity, and magnetoresistance studies in
the temperature (T) range 1.8-300 K. The results establish that there is a
long-range magnetic order of an antiferromagnetic type below (TN= ) 18.5 K,
despite a much large value (about 80 K) of paramagnetic Curie temperature with
a positive sign characteristic of ferromagnetic interaction. We attribute this
to geometric frustration. The most interesting finding is that there is an
additional magnetic anomaly below about 55 K before the onset of long range
order in the magnetic susceptibility data. Concurrent with this observation,
the sign of isothermal entropy change remains positive above TN with a broad
peak above TN. This observation indicates the presence of ferromagnetic
clusters before the onset of long range magnetic order. Thus, this compound may
serve as an example for a situation in which magnetic frustration due to
geometrical reasons is faced by competition with such precursor effects. There
is also a reversal of the sign of entropy-change in the curves for lower final
fields (for H less than 30 kOe) on entering into magnetically ordered state
consistent with the entrance into antiferromagnetic state. The
magnetoresistance behavior is consistent with above conclusions.

\emph{oblivious}, in the sense that their step sizes are scheduled regardless
of the function under consideration, except for limited side-information such

lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{L/\epsilon})$ for $L$-smooth convex functions, and
$\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{L/\mu}\ln(1/\epsilon))$ for $L$-smooth $\mu$-strongly
convex functions. These lower bounds are stronger than those in the traditional
oracle model, as they hold independently of the dimension. To attain these, we
abandon the oracle model in favor of a structure-based approach which builds
upon a framework recently proposed in (Arjevani et al., 2015). We further show
that without knowing the strong convexity parameter, it is impossible to attain
an iteration complexity better than
$\tilde{\Omega}\left((L/\mu)\ln(1/\epsilon)\right)$. This result is then used
to formalize an observation regarding $L$-smooth convex functions, namely, that

$V(\Gamma)$ admitting a nontrivial $G$-invariant partition $\mathcal{B}$ such
that there is exactly one edge of $\Gamma$ between any two distinct blocks of
$\mathcal{B}$. This is achieved by giving a classification of $(G,
2)$-point-transitive and $G$-block-transitive designs $\mathcal{D}$ together
with $G$-orbits $\Omega$ on the flag set of $\mathcal{D}$ such that $G_{\sigma,
L}$ is transitive on $L \setminus \{\sigma\}$ and $L \cap N = \{\sigma\}$ for
distinct $(\sigma, L), (\sigma, N) \in \Omega$, where $G_{\sigma, L}$ is the
setwise stabilizer of $L$ in the stabilizer $G_{\sigma}$ of $\sigma$ in $G$.
Along the way we determine all imprimitive blocks of $G_{\sigma}$ on $V

mechanics, based on the idea of replacing the usual time operator $\mathbf{T}$
with a suitable real-valued function $T$ on the space of physical states. The
proper characterization of the function $T$ relies on a particular relation
with the dynamical evolution of the system rather than with the infinitesimal
generator of the dynamics (Hamiltonian). We first consider the case of
classical Hamiltonian mechanics, where observables are functions on phase space
and the tools of differential geometry can be applied. The idea is then
extended to the case of the unitary evolution of pure states of finite-level
quantum systems by means of the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. It
is found that $T$ is a function on the space of pure states which is not
associated to any self-adjoint operator. The link between $T$ and the dynamical
evolution is interpreted as defining a simultaneity relation for the states of
the system with respect to the dynamical evolution itself. It turns out that
different dynamical evolutions lead to different notions of simultaneity, i.e.,
the notion of simultaneity is a dynamical notion.

discrepancy between the amount of intracluster medium (ICM) estimated from
stellar evolution theories and that emerging from observations in globular
clusters (GCs). One possible scenario is the accretion of this medium by an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) at the centre of the cluster. In this work,
we aim at modelling the cluster colour-excess profile as a tracer of the ICM
density, both with and without an IMBH. Comparing the profiles with
observations allows us to test the existence of IMBHs and their possible role
in the cleansing of the ICM. We derive the intracluster density profiles from
hydrodynamical models of accretion onto a central IMBH in a GC and we determine
the corresponding dust density. This model is applied to a list of 25 Galactic
GCs. We find that central IMBHs decrease the ICM by several orders of
magnitude. In a subset of 9 clusters, the absence of the black hole combined
with a low intracluster medium temperature would be at odds with present gas
mass content estimations. As a result, we conclude that IMBHs are an effective
cleansing mechanism of the ICM of GCs. We construct synthetic extinction maps
for M 62 and {\omega} Cen, two clusters in the small subset of 9 with observed
2D extinction maps. We find that under reasonable assumptions regarding the
model parameters, if the gas temperature in M 62 is close to 8000 K, an IMBH
needs to be invoked. Further ICM observations regarding both the gas and dust
in GCs could help to settle this issue.

$1.069 \pm 0.030$ (allowing for the $\simeq 5$% Bolocam flux calibration

a modified A10 model with the outer logarithmic slope $\beta$ allowed to vary,
finding $\beta = 6.13 \pm 0.16 \pm 0.76$ (measurement error followed by

visibility counting problem (VCP) is to preprocess $S$ such that the number of
segments in $S$ visible from any query point $p$ can be computed quickly. This
problem can trivially be solved in logarithmic query time using $O(n^{4})$
preprocessing time and space. Gudmundsson and Morin proposed a 2-approximation
algorithm for this problem with a tradeoff between the space and the query
time. They answer any query in $O_{\epsilon}(n^{1-\alpha})$ with
$O_{\epsilon}(n^{2+2\alpha})$ of preprocessing time and space, where $\alpha$
is a constant $0\leq \alpha\leq 1$, $\epsilon > 0$ is another constant that can
be made arbitrarily small, and $O_{\epsilon}(f(n))=O(f(n)n^{\epsilon})$.

tradeoff between the space and the query time. We will show that for an
arbitrary constants $0\leq \beta\leq \frac{2}{3}$ and $0<\delta <1$, the
expected preprocessing time, the expected space, and the query time of our
algorithm are $O(n^{4-3\beta}\log n)$, $O(n^{4-3\beta})$, and
$O(\frac{1}{\delta^3}n^{\beta}\log n)$, respectively. The algorithm computes
the number of visible segments from $p$, or $m_p$, exactly if $m_p\leq
\frac{1}{\delta^3}n^{\beta}\log n$. Otherwise, it computes a
$(1+\delta)$-approximation $m'_p$ with the probability of at least
$1-\frac{1}{\log n}$, where $m_p\leq m'_p\leq (1+\delta)m_p$.

determining the K-theory of these C*-algebras and by combining this information

focus on quasi-uniform storage allocation and provide a service rate analysis

interesting inclusions among the various classes of considered homomorphisms.
As a consequence, we find a procedure for computing $c(X)$ when the projection

flexibility, i.e., the ""de-automatization"" of thought and behavior. However,
little research or theory has addressed how internal thought patterns might
change after such interventions, even though alterations in the internal flow
of consciousness may precede externally observable changes in behavior. This
chapter outlines three mechanisms by which meditation or hypnosis might alter
or reduce automatic associations and elaborations of spontaneous thought: by an
overall reduction of the chaining of thoughts into an associative stream; by
de-automatizing and diversifying the content of thought chains (i.e.,
increasing thought flexibility or variety); and, finally, by re-automatizing
chains of thought along desired or valued paths (i.e., forming new, voluntarily
chosen mental habits). The authors discuss behavioral and cognitive
neuroscientific evidence demonstrating the influence of hypnosis and meditation
on internal cognition and highlight the putative neurobiological basis, as well
as potential benefits, of these forms of de-automatization.

write down the message passing system of equations for this model and prove,
for the first time, that it has a unique feasible solution. We also generalise
an earlier result by proving that this solution provides a rigorous upper bound
for the expected epidemic size (cumulative number of infection events) at any
fixed time $t>0$.
  We specialise these results to a homogeneous special case where the graph
(network) is symmetric. The message passing system here reduces to just four
equations. We prove that cycles in the network inhibit the spread of infection,
and derive important epidemiological results concerning the final epidemic size
and threshold behaviour for a major outbreak. For Poisson contact processes,
this message passing system is equivalent to a non-Markovian pair approximation
model, which we show has well-known pairwise models as special cases.
  We show further that a sequence of message passing systems, starting with the
homogeneous one just described, converges to the deterministic
Kermack-McKendrick equations for this stochastic model. For Poisson contact and
recovery, we show that this convergence is monotone, from which it follows that
the message passing system (and hence also the pairwise model) here provides a
better approximation to the expected epidemic size at time $t>0$ than the

been surrounded by a number of satellites before their infall into the Milky
Way. Many of those satellites should still be in close proximity to the Clouds,
but some could have dispersed ahead/behind the Clouds along their Galactic
orbit. Either way, prior association with the Clouds results in strong
restrictions on the present-day positions and velocities of candidate
Magellanic satellites: they must lie close to the nearly-polar orbital plane of
the Magellanic stream, and their distances and radial velocities must follow
the latitude dependence expected for a tidal stream with the Clouds at
pericenter. We use a cosmological numerical simulation of the disruption of a
massive subhalo in a Milky Way-sized LCDM halo to test whether any of the 20
dwarfs recently-discovered in the DES, SMASH, Pan-STARRS, and ATLAS surveys are
truly associated with the Clouds. Of the 6 systems with kinematic data, only
Hydra II and Hor 1 have distances and radial velocities consistent with a
Magellanic origin. Of the remaining dwarfs, six (Hor 2, Eri 3, Ret 3, Tuc 4,
Tuc 5, and Phx 2) have positions and distances consistent with a Magellanic
origin, but kinematic data are needed to substantiate that possibility.
Conclusive evidence for association would require proper motions to constrain
the orbital angular momentum direction, which, for true Magellanic satellites,
must coincide with that of the Clouds. We use this result to predict radial
velocities and proper motions for all new dwarfs. Our results are relatively
insensitive to the assumption of first or second pericenter for the Clouds.

the vertical structure of galaxy disks. The simulations follow three
exponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity, radial
scalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop different
non-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to
strong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial
migration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,
mixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects
primarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.
This ""provenance bias"" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating
stars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do
not thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.
Migrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,
not by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread
inward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\alpha$/Fe]
mono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against
interpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward
migration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height
of any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs
have scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that
greatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical
bias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial
migration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial
dependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations.

the connections between the Luttinger theorem for the size of the Fermi
surface, topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and critical theories
involving changes in the size of the Fermi surface. We begin with the
derivation of the Luttinger theorem for a Fermi liquid, using momentum balance
during a process of flux-insertion in a lattice electronic model with toroidal
boundary conditions. We then review the TQFT of the Z2 spin liquid, and
demonstrate its compatibility with the toroidal momentum balance argument. This
discussion leads naturally to a simple construction of `topological' Fermi
liquid states: the fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and the algebraic charge
liquid (ACL). We present arguments for a description of the pseudogap metal of
the cuprates using Z2-FL* or Z2-ACL states with Ising-nematic order. These
pseudogap metal states are also described as Higgs phases of a SU(2) gauge
theory. The Higgs field represents local antiferromagnetism, but the
Higgs-condensed phase does not have long-range antiferromagnetic order: the
magnitude of the Higgs field determines the pseudogap, the reconstruction of
the Fermi surface, and the Ising-nematic order. Finally, we discuss the route
to the large Fermi surface Fermi liquid via the critical point where the Higgs
condensate and Ising nematic order vanish, and the application of Higgs
criticality to the strange metal.

confirming that the association is gravitationally unbound. The association
appears to be dynamically unevolved, as evidenced by considerable kinematic
substructure, non-isotropic velocity dispersions and a lack of energy
equipartition. The proper motions show no evidence for a global expansion
pattern, with approximately the same amount of kinetic energy in expansion as
there is in contraction, which argues against the association being an expanded
star cluster disrupted by process such as residual gas expulsion or tidal
heating. The kinematic substructures, which appear to be close to virial
equilibrium and have typical masses of 40-400 M$_\odot$, also do not appear to
have been affected by the expulsion of the residual gas. We conclude that Cyg

(SPH) cosmological zoom simulations of a region around a forming galaxy
cluster, comparing the ability of the methods to handle successively more
complex baryonic physics. In the simplest, non-radiative case, the two methods
are in good agreement with each other, but the SPH simulations generate central
cores with slightly lower entropies and virial shocks at slightly larger radii,
consistent with what has been seen in previous studies. The inclusion of
radiative cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback leads to much larger
differences between the two methods. Most dramatically, at z=5, rapid cooling
in the AMR case moves the accretion shock well within the virial radius, while
this shock remains near the virial radius in the SPH case, due to excess
heating, coupled with poorer capturing of the shock width. On the other hand,
the addition of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the simulations
results in much better agreement between the methods. In this case both
simulations display halo gas entropies of 100 keV cm^2, similar decrements in
the star-formation rate, and a drop in the halo baryon content of roughly 30%.
This is consistent with AGN growth being self-regulated, regardless of the
numerical method. However, the simulations with AGN feedback continue to differ
in aspects that are not self-regulated, such that in SPH a larger volume of gas
is impacted by feedback, and the cluster still has a lower entropy central
core.

minimizing the errors in the observables mass, radius, and the moment of

optimal errors for the smallest number of parameters. Specifically, it
recreates the radii of the assumed EoS to within less than 0.5 km for the

annealing have made prototypical annealing optimizers with hundreds of qubits
commercially available. The experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for
optimization problems has since then become a coveted, albeit elusive goal.
Recent studies have shown that the so far inconclusive results, regarding a
quantum enhancement, may have been partly due to the benchmark problems used
being unsuitable. In particular, these problems had inherently too simple a
structure, allowing for both traditional resources and quantum annealers to
solve them with no special efforts. The need therefore has arisen for the
generation of harder benchmarks which would hopefully possess the
discriminative power to separate classical scaling of performance with size,
from quantum. We introduce here a practical technique for the engineering of
extremely hard spin glass Ising-type problem instances that does not require
`cherry picking' from large ensembles of randomly generated instances. We
accomplish this by treating the generation of hard optimization problems itself
as an optimization problem, for which we offer a heuristic algorithm that
solves it. We demonstrate the genuine thermal hardness of our generated
instances by examining them thermodynamically and analyzing their energy
landscapes, as well as by testing the performance of various state-of-the art
algorithms on them. We argue that a proper characterization of the generated
instances offers a practical, efficient way to properly benchmark experimental
quantum annealers, as well as any other optimization algorithm.

errors can be made arbitrarily small by performing the process more slowly. To
enhance the performance of quantum information processing with Majorana zero

impose constraints on the optimal protocol to take advantage of the nonlocal

using the Pontryagin's maximum principle, we show that robust equivalent gates
to perfect adiabatic braiding can be implemented in finite times through
optimal pulses. In our implementation, modifications to the device Hamiltonian
are avoided. Focusing on thermally isolated systems, we study the effects of
calibration errors and external white and $1/f$ (pink) noise on Majorana-based
gates. While a noise-induced antiadiabatic behavior, where a slower process
creates more diabatic excitations, prohibits indefinite enhancement of the
robustness of the adiabatic scheme, our fast optimal protocols exhibit
remarkable stability to noise and have the potential to significantly enhance
the practical performance of Majorana-based information processing.

and MUSIC (MUtiple SIgnal Classification) can be applied to identify more
sources than the number of sensors. While such a MUSIC algorithm works quite
well, its performance has not been theoretically analyzed. In this paper, we
derive a simplified asymptotic mean square error (MSE) expression for the MUSIC

same asymptotic MSE for MUSIC. We also show that when there are more sources
than the number of sensors, the MSE converges to a positive value instead of
zero when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity. This finding
explains the ""saturation"" behavior of the coarray-based MUSIC algorithms in the
high SNR region observed in previous studies. Finally, we derive the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for sparse linear arrays, and conduct a numerical
study of the statistical efficiency of the coarray-based estimator.

  applications",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The batched greedy strategy is an approximation algorithm to maximize a set
function subject to a matroid constraint. Starting with the empty set, the
batched greedy strategy iteratively adds to the current solution set a batch of
elements that results in the largest gain in the objective function while
satisfying the matroid constraints. In this paper, we develop bounds on the
performance of the batched greedy strategy relative to the optimal strategy in
terms of a parameter called the total batched curvature. We show that when the
objective function is a polymatroid set function, the batched greedy strategy
satisfies a harmonic bound for a general matroid constraint and an exponential
bound for a uniform matroid constraint, both in terms of the total batched
curvature. We also study the behavior of the bounds as functions of the batch
size. Specifically, we prove that the harmonic bound for a general matroid is
nondecreasing in the batch size and the exponential bound for a uniform matroid
is nondecreasing in the batch size under the condition that the batch size
divides the rank of the uniform matroid. Finally, we illustrate our results by
considering a task scheduling problem and an adaptive sensing problem.

very strong requirements in terms of tolerable laser phase noise.
LLO-sequential CV-QKD can thus in practice only be implemented with expensive,
low phase noise lasers, such as ECL lasers. The main contribution of this work
is to introduce designs for LLO CV-QKD based on self-coherence phase sharing,
in which the phase reference information and the quantum information are
coherently obtained from a single optical wavefront. We propose in particular a
design, called LLO-displacement, where the phase reference information is
encoded in the displacement of the standard CV-QKD Gaussian modulated coherent
state (GMCS) protocol. We analyze the performance and the hardware requirements
of the LLO-displacement design and our results indicate that it can be used to
perform CV-QKD over distances up to 100 km with realistic and affordable
hardware, in particular with standard telecom equipment and low cost DFB
lasers. This opens a practical path towards the development of coherent quantum

consensus in heterogeneous Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) general nonlinear
Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) subjected to directed communication topology. First,
the input-output feedback linearization method is utilized assuming that the
internal dynamics is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) to obtain linearized
subsystems of agents. Consequently, we propose local dynamic controllers for
agents such that the linearized subsystems have an identical closed-loop
dynamics which has a single pole at the origin whereas other poles are on the
open left half complex plane. This allows us to deal with distinct agents
having arbitrarily vector relative degrees and to derive rank-$1$ cooperative
control inputs for those homogeneous linearized dynamics which results in a
minimum rank distributed dynamic consensus controller for the initial nonlinear
MAS. Moreover, we prove that the coupling strength in the consensus protocol
can be arbitrarily small but positive and hence our consensus design is
non-conservative. Next, our design approach is further strengthened by tackling
the problem of randomly switching communication topologies among agents where
we relax the assumption on the balance of each switched graph and derive a
distributed rank-$1$ dynamic consensus controller. Lastly, a numerical example
is introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

rotating black hole (BH), is widely believed to work for driving relativistic
jets in active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and Galactic microquasars,
although it is still under debate how the Poynting flux is causally produced
and how the rotational energy of the BH is reduced. We generically discuss the
Kerr BH magnetosphere filled with a collisionless plasma screening the electric
field along the magnetic field, extending the arguments of Komissarov and our
previous paper, and propose a new picture for resolving the issues. For the
magnetic field lines threading the equatorial plane in the ergosphere, we find
that the inflow of particles with negative energy as measured in the coordinate
basis is generated near that plane as a feedback from the Poynting flux
production, which appears to be a similar process to the mechanical Penrose
process. For the field lines threading the event horizon, we first show that
the concept of the steady inflow of negative electromagnetic energy is not
physically essential, partly because the sign of the electromagnetic energy
density depends on the coordinates. Then we build an analytical toy model of a
time-dependent process both in the Boyer-Lindquist and Kerr-Schild coordinate
systems in which the force-free plasma injected continuously is filling a
vacuum, and suggest that the structure of the steady outward Poynting flux is
causally constructed by the displacement current and the cross-field current at
the in-going boundary between the plasma and the vacuum. In the steady state,
the Poynting flux is maintained without any electromagnetic source.

Based on these
incidents, and the heavy usage of antibiotics in hospitals, it has been assumed
that antibiotic resistance evolves in hospital environments. To test this
assumption, we studied resistance phenotypes of bacteria collected from patient
isolates at a community hospital over a 2.5-year period. A graphical model
analysis shows no association between resistance and patient information other
than time of arrival. This allows us to focus on time course data.
  We introduce a Hospital Transmission Model, based on negative binomial delay.
Our main contribution is a statistical hypothesis test called the Nosocomial
Evolution of Resistance Detector (NERD). It calculates the significance of
resistance trends occurring in a hospital. It can inform hospital staff about
the effects of various practices and interventions, can help detect clonal
outbreaks, and is available as an R-package.
  We applied the NERD method to each of the 16 antibiotics in the study via 16
hypothesis tests. For 13 of the antibiotics, we found that the hospital
environment had no significant effect upon the evolution of resistance; the
hospital is merely a piece of the larger picture. The p-values obtained for the
other three antibiotics (Cefepime, Ceftazidime and Gentamicin) indicate that
particular care should be taken in hospital practices with these antibiotics.
One of the three, Ceftazidime, was significant after accounting for multiple
hypotheses, indicating a trend of decreased resistance for this drug.

suggested a subsonic accretion model for low-luminosity ($<4\times 10^{36}$

investigate the spin period distribution of wind-fed X-ray pulsars with a
supergiant companion star, using a population synthesis method. We find that
the modeled distribution of supergiant HMXBs in the spin period - orbital
period diagram is consistent with observations provided that the winds from the
donor stars have relatively low terminal velocities ($\lesssim 1000$
kms$^{-1}$). The measured wind velocities in several supergiant HMXBs seem to
favor this viewpoint. The predicted number ratio of wind-fed X-ray pulsars with

a dynamic wetting phenomenon relevant to numerous industrial processes and

counterflow driven by capillary pressures caused by deformation of the free

a sequence of random thermally activated transitions between multiple

high mass X-ray binary system with a Be-star companion. A recent survey of the
SMC under a Chandra X-ray Visionary program found the source in a transition
when the X-ray flux was on a steady rise. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram revealed
a pulse period of 211.49 +/- 0.42 s, which is significantly (>5sigma) shorter
than the previous measurements with XMM-Newton and RXTE. This implies that the
system has gone through sudden spin-up episodes recently. The pulse profile
shows a sharp eclipse-like feature with a modulation amplitude of >95%. The
linear rise of the observed X-ray luminosity from <~2x to 7x10^35 erg s^-1 is
correlated with steady softening of the X-ray spectrum, which can be described
by the changes in the local absorption from N_H ~ 10^24 to <~10^20 cm^-2 for an
absorbed power-law model. The soft X-ray emission below 2 keV was absent in the
early part of the observation when only the pulsating hard X-ray component was
observed, whereas at later times both soft and hard X-ray components were
observed pulsating. A likely explanation is that the neutron star was initially
hidden in the circumstellar disk of the companion, and later came out of the
disk with the accreted material that continued fueling the observed pulsation.

typical frequency range that put them in the red-giant category rather than
cool dwarfs. We analyse the asteroseismic properties of these stars, derive
their surface gravities, masses, and radii and present updated effective
temperatures and distances. We show that the sample is significantly fainter

faintest stars reaching down to a Kepler magnitude, Kp~16. We demonstrate that
404 stars are at distances beyond 5 kpc and that the stars are significantly
less massive than for the original Kepler red-giant sample, consistent with a
population of distant halo giants. A comparison with a galactic population

of SDN in a current network must be incremental in most cases, for both
technical and economic reasons. During this period, operators have to manage
hybrid networks, where SDN and traditional protocols coexist. In this paper, we
study the energy efficient traffic engineering problem in hybrid SDN/IP
networks. We first formulate the mathematic optimization model considering
SDN/IP hybrid routing mode. As the problem is NP-hard, we propose the fast
heuristic algorithm named HEATE (Hybrid Energy-Aware Traffic Engineering). In
our proposed HEATE algorithm, the IP routers perform the shortest path routing
using the distribute OSPF link weight optimization. The SDNs perform the
multi-path routing with traffic flow splitting by the global SDN controller.
The HEATE algorithm finds the optimal setting of OSPF link weight and splitting
ratio of SDNs. Thus traffic flow is aggregated onto partial links and the
underutilized links can be turned off to save energy. By computer simulation
results, we show that our algorithm has a significant improvement in energy
efficiency in hybrid SDN/IP networks.

  Autonomous Vehicle in Highly Dynamic Environments",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper studies the relative pose problem for autonomous vehicle driving
in highly dynamic and possibly cluttered environments. This is a challenging
scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving
objects in the environment, which often leads to excessive portion of outliers
and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope
with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative
pose using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping individual
cameras. The method works robustly even when the numbers of outliers are
overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of driving scene we have
developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose, which
admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root-finding equation, and
runs extremely fast (at about 0.5$u$s per root). When the solver is used in
combination with RANSAC, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses,
significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic
data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real
data further confirm the method's practical relevance.

(NUkC). Given a finite metric space $(X,d)$ and a collection of balls of radii
$\{r_1\geq \cdots \ge r_k\}$, the NUkC problem is to find a placement of their
centers on the metric space and find the minimum dilation $\alpha$, such that
the union of balls of radius $\alpha\cdot r_i$ around the $i$th center covers
all the points in $X$. This problem naturally arises as a min-max vehicle
routing problem with fleets of different speeds.
  The NUkC problem generalizes the classic $k$-center problem when all the $k$
radii are the same (which can be assumed to be $1$ after scaling). It also
generalizes the $k$-center with outliers (kCwO) problem when there are $k$
balls of radius $1$ and $\ell$ balls of radius $0$. There are $2$-approximation
and $3$-approximation algorithms known for these problems respectively; the
former is best possible unless P=NP and the latter remains unimproved for 15
years.
  We first observe that no $O(1)$-approximation is to the optimal dilation is
possible unless P=NP, implying that the NUkC problem is more non-trivial than
the above two problems. Our main algorithmic result is an
$(O(1),O(1))$-bi-criteria approximation result: we give an $O(1)$-approximation
to the optimal dilation, however, we may open $\Theta(1)$ centers of each
radii. Our techniques also allow us to prove a simple (uni-criteria), optimal
$2$-approximation to the kCwO problem improving upon the long-standing

  It has been demonstrated that a pathway-based feature selection method which
incorporates biological information within pathways into the process of feature
selection usually outperform a gene-based feature selection algorithm in terms
of predictive accuracy, stability, and biological interpretation. Significance
analysis of microarray-gene set reduction algorithm (SAMGSR), an extension to a
gene set analysis method with further reduction of the selected pathways to
their respective core subsets, can be regarded as a pathway-based feature
selection method.
  Results and Discussion
  In SAMGSR, whether a gene is selected is mainly determined by its expression
difference between the phenotypes, and partially by the number of pathways to
which this gene belongs, but ignoring the topology information among pathways.
In this study, we propose a weighted version of the SAMGSR algorithm by
constructing weights based on the connectivity among genes and then
incorporating these weights in the test statistic.
  Conclusions
  Using both simulated and real-world data, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed SAMGSR extension and demonstrate that gene connectivity is indeed
informative for feature selection.

migrate poleward if they are to survive and keep up with the suitable habitat

whether populations have the capacity to keep up with shifting temperature
isoclines, and have mathematically determined the combination of growth and
dispersal that is needed to achieve this. However, the rate of isocline
movement can be highly variable, with much uncertainty associated with yearly
shifts. The same is true for population growth rates. Growth rates can be
variable and uncertain, even within suitable habitats for growth. In this paper
we reanalyze the question of population persistence in the context of the
uncertainty and variability in isocline shifts and rates of growth.
Specifically, we employ a stochastic integrodifference equation model on a
patch of suitable habitat that shifts poleward at a random rate. We derive a
metric describing the asymptotic growth rate of the linearized operator of the
stochastic model and yielding a threshold criterion for population persistence.
We demonstrate that the variability in the yearly shift and in the growth rate
has a significant negative effect on the persistence in the sense that it
decreases the threshold criterion for population persistence. Mathematically,
we show how the persistence metric can be connected to the principal eigenvalue
problem for a related integral operator, at least for the case where isocline
shifting speed is deterministic. Analysis of dynamics for the case where the
dispersal kernel is Gaussian leads to the existence of a critical shifting
speed. Finally we illustrate our different results for butterfly population
using numerical simulations and demonstrate how increased variances in isocline
shifts and growth rates translate into decreased likelihoods of persistence.

This is because
probability density functions do not exist for functional data. As a
consequence, the classical Bayes classifier using density quotients needs to be
modified. We propose to use density ratios of projections on a sequence of
eigenfunctions that are common to the groups to be classified. The density
ratios can then be factored into density ratios of individual functional
principal components whence the classification problem is reduced to a sequence
of nonparametric one-dimensional density estimates. This is an extension to
functional data of some of the very earliest nonparametric Bayes classifiers
that were based on simple density ratios in the one-dimensional case. By means
of the factorization of the density quotients the curse of dimensionality that
would otherwise severely affect Bayes classifiers for functional data can be
avoided. We demonstrate that in the case of Gaussian functional data, the
proposed functional Bayes classifier reduces to a functional version of the
classical quadratic discriminant. A study of the asymptotic behavior of the
proposed classifiers in the large sample limit shows that under certain
conditions the misclassification rate converges to zero, a phenomenon that has
been referred to as ""perfect classification"". The proposed classifiers also
perform favorably in finite sample applications, as we demonstrate in
comparisons with other functional classifiers in simulations and various data
applications, including wine spectral data, functional magnetic resonance

techniques and makes the estimation of PLDA parameters easier. Experimental
results on telephone conversations of the NIST 2008 and 2010 speaker

employs unique discretization and parallelization algorithms based on a
hexagonal close-packed lattice for efficient execution particularly on large

main goals of the planet formation studies. As an attempt to guide the
observational searches for weak lines of complex species in discs, we modelled
the (sub-)millimetre spectrum of gaseous methanol (CH$_3$OH), one of the
simplest organic molecules, in the representative T Tauri system. We used 1+1D
disc physical model coupled to the gas-grain ALCHEMIC chemical model with and
without 2D-turbulent mixing. The computed CH$_3$OH abundances along with the
CH$_3$OH scheme of energy levels of ground and excited torsional states were
used to produce model spectra obtained with the non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (non-LTE) 3D line radiative transfer code LIME. We found that the
modelled non-LTE intensities of the CH$_3$OH lines can be lower by factor of
$>10$--$100$ than those calculated under assumption of LTE. Though population
inversion occurs in the model calculations for many (sub-)millimetre
transitions, it does not lead to the strong maser amplification and noticeably
high line intensities. We identify the strongest CH$_3$OH (sub-)millimetre
lines that could be searched for with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)
in nearby discs. The two best candidates are the CH$_{3}$OH $5_0-4_0~A^+$
(241.791 GHz) and $5_{-1}-4_{-1}~E$ (241.767 GHz) lines, which could possibly
be detected with the $\sim5\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio after $\sim3$ hours of
integration with the full ALMA array.

computational time of the conventional branch-and-bound algorithms is rather
far from real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel bound computation method
on an efficient measurement domain for MF estimation, i.e., the extended

Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the performance of
the proposed method for various synthetic and real-world data. We also show the

considered key enablers for a flexible air-interface design for multi-service
support in future 5G systems. One candidate from this category of waveforms is
pulse shaped OFDM, which follows the idea of subcarrier filtering and aims at
fully maintaining the advantages of standard OFDM systems while addressing
their drawbacks. In this paper, we elaborate on several pulse shaping design
methods, and show how pulse shapes can be exploited as an additional degree of
freedom to provide better frequency localization and more efficient spectrum
utilization under a pre-defined spectrum mask. The performance analysis and
evaluation results show that, for a practical mobile communication systems, the
application of pulse shaping is a simple and effective means to achieve a lower
out-of-band leakage for OFDM systems at virtually no costs. In fact, the
complexity increase amounts to 1-2% compared to CP-OFDM only. In addition, the
system's robustness against both time and frequency distortions is shown to be
substantially improved by a proper pulse shape design. By allowing for the
flexible configuration of physical layer parameters per sub-band according to
the diverse requirements of future 5G services, pulse shaped OFDM systems can
efficiently facilitate asynchronous transmissions and fragmented spectrum
access, rendering it beneficial for various mobile-broadband and
Internet-of-Things applications.

for characterizing entanglement, has been extensively employed to explore

mean-field (MF) approach successfully predicts the emergence of QPTs, it fails
to include any entanglement. Here, for the first time, in the framework of a
cluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of
interacting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement
the cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to
superfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator
phases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part. To
quantify the residual bipartite entanglement in a cluster, we calculate the
second-order Renyi entropy, which can be experimentally measured by quantum
interference of many-body twins. The second-order Renyi entropy itself is
continuous everywhere, however, the continuousness of its first-order
derivative breaks down at the phase boundary. This means that the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions can still be efficiently captured by the
residual entanglement in our cluster MF treatment. Besides to the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions, our cluster MF treatment may also be used to
capture the signature of EE for other QPTs in quantum superlattice models.

that is thought to contribute to the transfer of angular momentum in
differentially rotating stars. It has been included in recent codes of stellar
evolution in a diffusion-like approximation, under the assumption that the
kinematic viscosity $\nu$ is unimportant for the development of the
instability. As noted previously by other authors, for most stellar
applications this may not be a valid approximation. We discuss this issue in
detail, solving the dispersion relation of the perturbed modes for realistic
values of $\nu$ in the bulk of the radiative zone of the Sun and of three red
giant stars at various evolutionary stages. We find that the GSF instability is
triggered only in layers of extremely strong shear. In a simple case study, we
also investigate the effect of a small deviation from axisymmetry or a small
background magnetic field. We find that, like the viscosity, these have a
stabilising effect. We conclude that this instability is probably far less
efficient in transporting angular momentum than is often assumed, and may not
even be present.

enhancement. This result demonstrates that the multilayer structures are useful

describe expert-designed prediction modes operating in certain angular

iteratively refine these predictors through regularized regression. The

minimizing a local distortion measure which depends only on the marginal
distribution of its observation. The central node, on the other hand, has
knowledge of the joint distribution of the source and all the observations and
produces the source estimate which minimizes a different distortion measure

investigate the problem of optimally choosing the rate of each lossy-compressed
remote estimate so as to minimize the distortion at the central processing unit
subject to a bound on the overall communication rate between the remote sensors

relevance: the case of a Gaussian source observed in additive Gaussian noise
and reconstructed under quadratic distortion, and the case of a binary source
observed in bit-flipping noise and reconstructed under Hamming distortion. In
both scenarios we show that there exist regimes under which having more remote
encoders does reduce the source distortion: in other words, having fewer,
high-quality remote estimates provides a smaller distortion than having more,
lower-quality estimates.

existence of positive and negative tendencies, while arousal increases when
reading emotional content regardless of its polarity. The tendency of

When participating in an online discussion, the content of participants'

  (SSSF) method",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When an acoustic wave travels in a lossy medium such as a liquid, it
progressively transfers its pseudo-momentum to the fluid, which results in a
steady acoustic streaming. Remarkably, the phenomenon involves a balance
between sound attenuation and shear, such that viscosity vanishes in the final
expression of the velocity field. For this reason, the effect of viscosity has
long been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments. Here, we show
experimentally that the viscosity plays a major role in cavities such as the
streaming induced by surface acoustic waves in sessile droplets. We develop a
numerical model based on the spatial filtering of the streaming source term to
compute the induced flow motion with dramatically reduced computational
requirements. We evidence that acoustic fields in droplets are a superposition
of a chaotic field and a few powerful caustics. It appears that the caustics
drive the flow, which allows a qualitative prediction of the flow structure.
Finally, we reduce the problem to two dimensionless numbers related to the
surface and bulk waves attenuation and simulate hemispherical sessile droplets
resting on a lithium niobate substrate for a range of parameters. Even in such
a baseline configuration, we observe at least four distinct flow regimes. For
each of them, we establish a correlation of the average streaming speed in the
droplet, which is increasingly dependent on the bulk wave attenuation as the
viscosity increases. These correlations extend our results to a wide range of
fluids and actuation frequencies.

representative heating rate. A heating series is also performed on the $768^3$

$1.33\times10^{-6}~M_\odot~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The $768^3$ simulation with the

convective boundary is found to scale linearly with the driving luminosity and
with the cube of the shear velocity at the upper boundary, while the radial RMS
fluid velocity scales with the cube root of the driving luminosity, as
expected. The mixing is analysed in a 1D diffusion framework, resulting in a
simple model for CB mixing. The analysis confirms previous findings that
limiting the MLT mixing length to the distance to the CB in 1D simulations
better represents the spherically-averaged radial velocity profiles from the 3D
simulations and provides an improved determination of the reference diffusion
coefficient $D_0$ for the exponential diffusion CB mixing model in 1D. From the

  pp. 91-101, 2016",,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents the design of a new asynchronous early output full
adder which when cascaded leads to a relative-timed ripple carry adder (RCA).
The relative-timed RCA requires imposing a very small relative-timing
assumption to overcome the problem of gate orphans associated with internal
carry propagation. The relative-timing assumption is however independent of the
RCA size. The primary benefits of the relative-timed RCA are processing of
valid data incurs data-dependent forward latency, while the processing of
spacer involves a very fast constant time reverse latency of just 1 full adder
delay which represents the ultimate in the design of an asynchronous RCA with
the fastest reset. The secondary benefits of the relative-timed RCA are it
achieves good optimization of power and area metrics simultaneously. A 32-bit
relative-timed RCA constructed using the proposed early output full adder
achieves respective reductions in forward latency by 67%, 10% and 3.5% compared
to the optimized strong-indication, weak-indication, and early output 32-bit
asynchronous RCAs existing in the literature. Based on a similar comparison,
the proposed 32-bit relative-timed RCA achieves corresponding reductions in
cycle time by 83%, 12.7% and 6.4%. In terms of area, the proposed 32-bit
relative-timed RCA occupies 27% less Silicon than its optimized
strong-indication counterpart and 17% less Silicon than its optimized
weak-indication counterpart, and features increased area occupancy by a meager
1% compared to the optimized early output 32-bit asynchronous RCA. The average
power dissipation of all the asynchronous 32-bit RCAs are found to be
comparable since they all satisfy the monotonic cover constraint. The
simulation results obtained correspond to a 32/28nm CMOS process.

  pp. 108-122, 2016",,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For digital system designs, triple modular redundancy (TMR), which is a
3-tuple version of N-modular redundancy is widely preferred for many
mission-control and safety-critical applications. The TMR scheme involves
two-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter
ensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system
remain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring
the correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the
TMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not
hold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions
of the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the
classical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the
literature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter
designs generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either
a faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.
Since multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,
simultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should
be considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under
such a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant
majority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing
voters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the
voter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and
area metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS
process.

our source by measuring the violation of a non-Gaussian state witness and show
that its output corresponds to ideal attenuated single photons. Combined with
current efforts to enhance collection efficiency from single emitters, our
results suggest that single trapped ions are not only ideal stationary qubits

MIMO channel when the input vector lies on a circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is
obtained and is shown to have a finite number of mass points on the circle.
Subsequently, it is shown that the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a full-rank $n$

by a uniform distribution over the surface of the hypersphere whose radius is
defined by the constant envelope. Finally, for the 2 by 2 channel, the power
allocation scheme of the constant envelope signaling is compared with that of
the conventional case, in which the constraint is on the average transmitted
power. It is observed that when the condition number of the channel is close to

better understanding of these challenges can help researchers and practitioners

relation to other software quality characteristics including usability. In this
empirical study, we have interviewed 17 practitioners from eight software
development companies. Their responses are coded and analysed with thematic
analysis. We report 11 challenges that practitioners face in their work with
UX. Some of these challenges partly overlap with those reported in existing
literature about usability or software quality characteristics. In contrast to
these overlaps, the participants of our study either view many of the
challenges unique to UX, or more severe than for usability or other quality
characteristics. Although at a superficial level challenges with UX and other
quality characteristics overlap, we differentiate these challenges at a deeper
level through two main aspects of UX: subjectivity and emergent nature. In
particular, we identify at least five issues that are essential to the very
nature of UX, and add at least seven extra difficulties to the work of
practitioners. These difficulties can explain why practitioners perceive the
challenges to be more severe than for other quality characteristics. Our
findings can be useful for researchers in identifying industrially relevant
research areas and for practitioners to learn from empirically investigated
challenges and base their improvement efforts on such knowledge. Investigating
the overlaps can help finding research areas not only for enhancing practice of
UX but also software quality in general. It also makes it easier for
practitioners to spot, better understand as well as find mitigation strategies
for UX challenges.

Technology in 2013. The experimental setup was designed to search for electrons
produced in meter-scale sparks using a 1 MV Marx generator. Negative voltage
was applied to the high voltage (HV) electrode. Five thin (1 mm) plastic
detectors (5 $\rm cm^2$ each) were distributed in various configurations close
to the spark gap. Earlier studies have shown (for HV negative) that X-rays are
produced when a cloud of streamers is developed 30-60 cm from the negative
electrode. This indicates that the electrons producing the X-rays are also
accelerated at this location, that could be in the strong electric field from
counterstreamers of opposite polarity. Comparing our measurements with modeling
results, we find that $\sim$300 keV electrons produced about 30-60 cm from the
negative electrode are the most likely source of our measurements. A
statistical analysis of expected detection of photon bursts by these fiber
detectors indicates that only 20%-45% of the detected bursts could be from soft
($\sim$10 keV) photons, which further supports that the majority of detected
bursts are produced by relativistic electrons.

to explain speed-dependent thicknesses of ice bandings. The dynamic interface
undercooling was obtained to explore curvature undercooling of pore ices and

Particle Tracking Method for measurements of flow or particle velocities.
First, a stereoscopic multicamera calibration method that does not require any

method gives better results than the most commonly-used technique, based on the
Tsai camera/optics model. Additionally, the methods uses a simple interpolant
to compute the transformation matrix and it is trivial to apply for any
experimental fluid dynamics visualization set up. The second contribution
proposes a solution to remove noise from Eulerian measurements of velocity
statistics obtained from Particle Tracking velocimetry, without the need of
filtering and/or windowing. The novel method presented here is based on
recomputing particle displacement measurements from two consecutive frames for
multiple different time-step values between frames. We show the successful
application of this new technique to recover the second order velocity
structure function of the flow. Increased accuracy is demonstrated by comparing
the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy measured from the second order
structure function against previously validated measurements. These two
techniques for improvement of experimental fluid/particle velocity measurements
can be combined to provide high accuracy 3D particle and/or flow velocity
statistics and derived variables needed to characterize a turbulent flow.

pornographic images and videos based on visual content, particularly on the
detection of skin color. Although these approaches provide good results, they
generally have the disadvantage of a high false positive rate since not all
images with large areas of skin exposure are necessarily pornographic images,
such as people wearing swimsuits or images related to sports. Local feature
based approaches with Bag-of-Words models (BoW) have been successfully applied
to visual recognition tasks in the context of pornography detection. Even
though existing methods provide promising results, they use local feature
descriptors that require a high computational processing time yielding
high-dimensional vectors. In this work, we propose an approach for pornography
detection based on local binary feature extraction and BossaNova image
representation, a BoW model extension that preserves more richly the visual

to the convective core at the core radius. This results in a large prefactor,
which is very sensitive to the global properties of the star, that multiplies
the torque. This large factor is compensated by a very small multiplicative
factor, $E_{2}$. Although this is mathematically accurate, depending on the
application this can lead to significant errors. The problem is even more
severe, since the calculation of $E_{2}$ itself is non-trivial, and different

$E_{2}$ values to the stellar mass, often in regimes where this is not sound
practice. We express the torque in an alternate form, cast in terms of

$\beta_{2}$. Previous attempts to express the torque in such a form are either
missing an important factor, which depends on the density profile of the star,

reward objectives, the problem of deciding whether a player can ensure
satisfaction of the objectives with given thresholds is decidable. The result
relies on intricate and novel proof which shows that the Pareto curves contain
only finitely many points. As a consequence, we get that the two-objective

decidable.

probability of security threat, which makes crowd counting more and more
important. Most of the existing approaches estimate the number of pedestrians
within one frame, which results in inconsistent predictions in terms of time.
This paper, for the first time, introduces a quadratic programming model with
the network flow constraints to improve the accuracy of crowd counting.
Firstly, the foreground of each frame is segmented into groups, each of which
contains several pedestrians. Then, a regression-based map is developed in
accordance with the relationship between low-level features of each group and
the number of people in it. Secondly, a directed graph is constructed to
simulate constraints on people's flow, whose vertices represent groups of each
frame and arcs represent people moving from one group to another. Then, the
people flow can be viewed as an integer flow in the constructed digraph.
Finally, by solving a quadratic programming problem with network flow
constraints in the directed graph, we obtain consistency in people counting.
The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the crowd
counting errors and improve the accuracy. Moreover, this method can also be
applied to any ultramodern group-based regression counting approach to get
improvements.

search. In this paper, we propose a novel decoding strategy motivated by an
earlier observation that nonlinear hidden layers of a deep neural network
stretch the data manifold. The proposed strategy is embarrassingly
parallelizable without any communication overhead, while improving an existing
decoding algorithm. We extensively evaluate it with attention-based neural
machine translation on the task of En->Cz translation.

normality of sums of random variables. In this article, we introduce a more

  To illustrate the power of the theory, we give applications to the following
objects: uniform random pair partitions, the random graph model $G(n,M)$,
uniform random permutations, the symmetric simple exclusion process and
multilinear statistics on Markov chains. The application to random permutations
gives a bivariate extension of a functional central limit theorem of Janson and

We present our results on tension propagating along the polymer segment on the
cis-side that is measured for the first time using our method that works also
in the presence of hydrodynamics. For simulations we use stochastic rotation
dynamics, also called multi-particle collision dynamics. We find that in the
good solvent the tension propagates very similarly whether hydrodynamics is
included or not. Only the tensed segment is by a constant factor shorter in the
presence of hydrodynamics. The shorter tensed segment and the hydrodynamic
interactions contribute to a smaller friction for the translocating polymer
when hydrodynamics is included, which shows as smaller waiting times and a
smaller exponent in the scaling of the translocation time with the polymer
length. In the bad solvent hydrodynamics has a minimal effect on polymer
translocation in contrast to the good solvent where it speeds up translocation.
We find that under bad-solvent conditions tension does not spread appreciably
along the polymer. Consequently, translocation time does not scale with the
polymer length. By measuring the effective friction in a setup where a polymer
in free solvent is pulled by a constant force at the end, we find that
hydrodynamics does speed up collective polymer motion in the bad solvent even
more effectively than in the good solvent. However, hydrodynamics has a
negligible effect on the motion of individual monomers within the highly
correlated globular conformation on the cis-side and hence on the entire driven
translocation under bad-solvent conditions.

on a one dimensional lattice, undergo directed or undirected diffusion, and
reconstitute -when in contact- by transferring a single monomer unit from one
k-mer to the other; the rates depend on the size of participating k-mers. This
polydispersed system has two conserved quantities, the number of k-mers and the
packing fraction. We provide a matrix product method to write the steady state
of this model and to calculate the spatial correlation functions analytically.
We show that for a constant reconstitution rate, the spatial correlation
exhibits damped oscillations in some density regions separated, from other
regions with exponential decay, by a disorder surface. In a specific limit,
this constant-rate reconstitution model is equivalent to a single dimer model
and exhibits a phase coexistence similar to the one observed earlier in totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring with a defect.

how to achieve small CP violation in the strong interactions despite large CP
violation in weak interactions. Observation of CP violation is exclusively
through the Higgs--Yukawa interactions. In this paper, we show that with
minimal assumptions on the structure of mass (Yukawa) matrices they do not
contribute to the strong CP problem and thus we can provide a pathway to a
solution of the strong CP problem within the structures of the Standard Model

flavor puzzle, models based on minimal SU(3) flavor groups leading to the
proposed flavor matrices are favored. Though we refrain from an explicit a UV
completion of the Standard Model, we provide a simple requirement those models

its orbital angular momentum vector, due to the tidal gravity of its host star,
if these directions are misaligned. This induces internal fluid motions inside
the planet that are subject to a hydrodynamic instability. We study the
turbulent damping of precessional fluid motions, as a result of this
instability, in the simplest local computational model of a giant planet (or
star), with and without a weak internal magnetic field. Our aim is to determine
the outcome of this instability, and its importance in driving tidal evolution
of the spin-orbit angle in precessing planets (and stars). We find that this
instability produces turbulent dissipation that is sufficiently strong that it
could drive significant tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle for hot
Jupiters with orbital periods shorter than about 10-18 days. If this mechanism
acts in isolation, this evolution would be towards alignment or anti-alignment,
depending on the initial angle, but the ultimate evolution (if other tidal
mechanisms also contribute) is expected to be towards alignment. The turbulent
dissipation is proportional to the cube of the precession frequency, so it
leads to much slower damping of stellar spin-orbit angles, implying that this
instability is unlikely to drive evolution of the spin-orbit angle in stars
(either in planetary or close binary systems). We also find that the
instability-driven flow can act as a system-scale dynamo, which may play a role
in producing magnetic fields in short-period planets.

propose two versions of a binomial likelihood ratio test for the null
hypothesis of no treatment effect. We show that both versions are more powerful
to detect any distributional change than existing methods in finite sample
cases, and are asymptotically equivalent to the two-sample Anderson-Darling
test. We also develop an efficient algorithm for computing our estimates, and

of complex networks. A modeling framework to capture this are temporal graphs
which consist of a set of vertices (entities in the network) and a set of
time-stamped binary interactions between the vertices. We focus on enumerating
delta-cliques, an extension of the concept of cliques to temporal graphs: for a
given time period delta, a delta-clique in a temporal graph is a set of
vertices and a time interval such that all vertices interact with each other at
least after every delta time steps within the time interval. Viard, Latapy, and
Magnien [ASONAM 2015, TCS 2016] proposed a greedy algorithm for enumerating all
maximal delta-cliques in temporal graphs. In contrast to this approach, we
adapt the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm - an efficient, recursive backtracking
algorithm which enumerates all maximal cliques in static graphs - to the
temporal setting. We obtain encouraging results both in theory (concerning
worst-case running time analysis based on the parameter ""delta-slice
degeneracy"" of the underlying graph) as well as in practice with experiments on
real-world data. The latter culminates in an improvement for most interesting
delte-values concerning running time in comparison with the algorithm of Viard,

quantized vector potential. We next show these are three equivalent alternative
ways of calculating the AB shift. We consider the exact problem where all three
entities are quantized. We approximate the wave function as the product of
three wave functions, a vector potential wave function, an electron wave
function and a solenoid wave function. We apply the variational principle for
the exact Schrodinger equation to this approximate form of solution. This leads
to three Schrodinger equations, one each for vector potential, electron and
solenoid, each with classical sources for the other two entities. However, each
Schrodinger equation contains an additional real c-number term, the time
derivative of an extra phase. We show that these extra phases are such that the
net phase of the total wave function produces the AB shift. Since none of the
three entities requires different treatment from any of the others, this leads
to three alternative views of the physical cause of the AB magnetic effect.
