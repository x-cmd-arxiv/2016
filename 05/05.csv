random typing model but it has multiple advantages over random typing: (1) it
starts from realistic cognitive pressures (2) it does not require fine tuning
of parameters and (3) it sheds light on the origins of other statistical laws

findings suggest that the recurrence of Zipf's law in human languages could
originate from pressure for easy and fast communication.

is of interest to generalize the results obtained in semi-static trading to the
case when one is allowed to statically trade American options. However, this
problem has proved to be elusive so far because of the asymmetric nature of the
positions of holding versus shorting such options. Here we provide a unified
framework and generalize the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) and
hedging dualities in arXiv:1502.06681 (to appear in Annals of Applied
Probability) to the case where the investor can also short American options.
Following arXiv:1502.06681, we assume that the longed American options are
divisible. As for the shorted American options, we show that the divisibility
plays no role regarding arbitrage property and hedging prices. Then using the
method of enlarging probability spaces proposed in arXiv:1604.05517, we convert
the shorted American options to European options, and establish the FTAP and
sub- and super-hedging dualities in the enlarged space both with and without
model uncertainty.

speech enhancement algorithms, and hinders such methods from being used more
extensively. A dictionary based speech enhancement method that emphasizes
preserving the underlying speech is proposed. Spectral patches of clean speech
are sampled and clustered to train a dictionary. Given a noisy speech spectral
patch, the best matching dictionary entry is selected and used to estimate the
noise power at each time-frequency bin. The noise estimation step is formulated
as an outlier detection problem, where the noise at each bin is assumed present
only if it is an outlier to the corresponding bin of the best matching
dictionary entry. This framework assigns higher priority in removing spectral
elements that strongly deviate from a typical spoken unit stored in the trained
dictionary. Even without the aid of a separate noise model, this method can
achieve significant noise reduction for various non-stationary noises, while
effectively preserving the underlying speech in more challenging noisy

wants to send two independent packet streams to destinations $\{d_1,d_2\}$ with
the help of relay $r$. The transmission from $s$ or $r$ is modeled by packet
erasure channels: For each time slot, a packet transmitted by $s$ may be
received, with some probabilities, by a random subset of $\{d_1,d_2,r\}$; and
those transmitted by $r$ will be received by a random subset of $\{d_1,d_2\}$.
Interference is avoided by allowing at most one of $\{s,r\}$ to transmit in
each time slot. One example of this model is any cellular network that supports
two cell-edge users when a relay in the middle uses the same downlink resources
for throughput/safety enhancement.
  In this setting, we study the capacity region of $(R_1,R_2)$ when allowing
linear network coding (LNC). The proposed LNC inner bound introduces more
advanced packing-mixing operations other than the previously well-known
butterfly-style XOR operation on overheard packets of two co-existing flows. A
new LNC outer bound is derived by exploring the inherent algebraic structure of
the LNC problem. Numerical results show that, with more than 85% of the
experiments, the relative sum-rate gap between the proposed outer and inner
bounds is smaller than 0.08% under the strong-relaying setting and 0.04% under

re-brightenings. A newly born magnetar will lose its rotational energy in the
form of Poynting-flux, which may be converted into a wind of electron-positron
pairs through some magnetic dissipation processes. As proposed by Dai (2004),
this wind will catch up with the GRB outflow and a long-lasting reverse shock
would form. By applying this scenario to GRB afterglows, we find that the
reverse shock propagating back into the electron-positron wind can lead to an
observable optical re-brightening and a simultaneous X-ray plateau (or X-ray
shallow decay). In our study, we select four GRBs, i.e., GRB 080413B, GRB
090426, GRB 091029, and GRB 100814A, of which the optical afterglows are well
observed and show clear re-brightenings. We find that they can be well
interpreted. In our scenario, the spin-down timescale of the magnetar should be
slightly smaller than the peak time of the re-brightening, which can provide a

cancellation of the self-interference (SI) signal generated by the
transmitter.Current techniques for suppressing SI rely on generating a copy of
the SI signal and subtracting it partly in the RF (radio frequency) and digital
domains. A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation
of the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to
the antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath
reflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and
digital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the
analog and the digital domain. Assuming such a model leads to a large
form-factor for the analog and RF circuits and increased complexity in the
digital domain.
  In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the
self-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modelled
as $H(f)=C_0 + C_1f$ in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective
self-interference channel can be represented by two parameters $C_0$ and $C_1$,
irrespective of the multipath environment. We also provide experimental
evidence to verify the above channel model and propose novel low-complexity
designs for self-interference cancellation. Linearization not only aids in the
practicality of analog cancellation by reducing the form factor, but also
results in a simpler SI filter model in the digital domain due to
dimensionality reduction of the channel parameters. Therefore this method can
enable the widespread adoption of full-duplex techniques to portable devices in
addition to infrastructure base-stations.

these models must reproduce the emission at the solar limb. In this work, we
tested both the VALC and the C7 semi-empirical models by computing their
emission spectrum in the frequency range from 2 GHz to 10 THz, at solar limb
altitudes. We calculate the Sun's theoretical radii as well as their limb

hydrogen, electron density, and H-. In order to solve the radiative transfer
equation a 3D geometry was employed to determine the ray paths and
Bremsstrahlung, H-, and inverse Bremsstrahlung opacity sources were integrated
in the optical depth. We compared the computed solar radii with high resolution
observations at the limb obtained by Clark (1994). We found that there are
differences between observed and computed solar radii of 12000 km at 20 GHz,
5000 km at 100 GHz, and 1000 km at 3 THz for both semi-empirical models. A
difference of 8000 km in the solar radii was found comparing our results

  (Extended Version)","Samsung Research America Technical Report",,,"SRA-CSIC-2016-001","cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent years have seen growing interest in the retrofitting of type systems
onto dynamically-typed programming languages, in order to improve type safety,
programmer productivity, or performance. In such cases, type system developers
must strike a delicate balance between disallowing certain coding patterns to
keep the type system simple, or including them at the expense of additional
complexity and effort. Thus far, the process for designing retrofitted type
systems has been largely ad hoc, because evaluating multiple variations of a
type system on large bodies of existing code is a significant undertaking.
  We present trace typing: a framework for automatically and quantitatively
evaluating variations of a retrofitted type system on large code bases. The
trace typing approach involves gathering traces of program executions,
inferring types for instances of variables and expressions occurring in a
trace, and merging types according to merge strategies that reflect specific
(combinations of) choices in the source-level type system design space.
  We evaluated trace typing through several experiments. We compared several
variations of type systems retrofitted onto JavaScript, measuring the number of
program locations with type errors in each case on a suite of over fifty
thousand lines of JavaScript code. We also used trace typing to validate and
guide the design of a new retrofitted type system that enforces fixed object
layout for JavaScript objects. Finally, we leveraged the types computed by
trace typing to automatically identify tag tests --- dynamic checks that refine
a type --- and examined the variety of tests identified.

promising dark matter candidates. An important feature of pNGBs is their
periodic potential, whose scale of periodicity controls all their couplings. As
a consequence of the periodicity the maximal potential energy is limited and,
hence, producing the observed dark matter density poses significant constraints
on the allowed masses and couplings. In the presence of a monodromy, the field
range as well as the range of the potential can be significantly extended. As
we argue in this paper this has important phenomenological consequences. The
constraints on the masses and couplings are ameliorated and couplings to
Standard Model particles could be significantly stronger, thereby opening up
considerable experimental opportunities. Yet, monodromy models can also give
rise to new and qualitatively different features. As a remnant of the
periodicity the potential can feature pronounced wiggles. When the field is
passing through them quantum fluctuations are enhanced and particles with
non-vanishing momentum are produced. Here, we perform a first analysis of this
effect and delineate under which circumstances this becomes important. We
discuss possible cosmological consequences.

segmentation with deep convolutional neural nets (ConvNet) when densely labeled
training images are not available. More specifically, the proposed loss
function penalizes the L1-norm of the gradient of the label probability vector
image , i.e. total variation, produced by the ConvNet. This can be seen as a
regularization term that promotes piecewise smoothness of the label probability
vector image produced by the ConvNet during learning. The unsupervised loss
function is combined with a supervised loss in a semi-supervised setting to
learn ConvNets that can achieve high semantic segmentation accuracy even when
only a tiny percentage of the pixels in the training images are labeled. We
demonstrate significant improvements over the purely supervised setting in the
Weizmann horse, Stanford background and Sift Flow datasets. Furthermore, we
show that using the proposed piecewise smoothness constraint in the learning
phase significantly outperforms post-processing results from a purely
supervised approach with Markov Random Fields (MRF). Finally, we note that the
framework we introduce is general and can be used to learn to label other types
of structures such as curvilinear structures by modifying the unsupervised loss
function accordingly.

In contrast, for death-birth (DB) updating, we derive a simple, computationally
tractable formula for weak selection to favor cooperation when starting from
any configuration containing any number of cooperators and defectors. This
formula elucidates two important features: (i) the takeover of cooperation can
be enhanced by the strategic placement of cooperators and (ii) adding more
cooperators to a configuration can sometimes suppress the evolution of
cooperation. These findings give a formal account for how selection acts on all
transient states that appear in evolutionary trajectories. They also inform the
strategic design of initial states in social networks to maximally promote
cooperation. We also derive general results that characterize the interaction

unstable causing it to turn into an insulating one. Despite the fact that the
interplay of these two routes to a vanishing conductivity has been a central
research topic, a unifying picture has not emerged so far. Here, we establish
that the two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model, one of the simplest lattice
models of strong electron correlation does allow for the study of this
interplay. In particular, we show that this model at particle-hole symmetry
possesses three distinct thermodynamic insulating phases and exhibits Anderson
localization. The previously reported metallic phase is identified as a
finite-size feature due to the presence of weak localization. We characterize
these phases by their electronic density of states, staggered occupation,
conductivity, and the generalized inverse participation ratio. The implications
of our findings for other strongly correlated systems are discussed.

the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) also requires a corresponding increase in
the precision of theoretical modeling. A commonly made approximation is to
model the CMB deflection angle or lensing potential as a Gaussian random field.
In this paper, however, we analytically quantify the influence of the
non-Gaussianity of large-scale structure lenses, arising from nonlinear
structure formation, on CMB lensing measurements. In particular, evaluating the
impact of the non-zero bispectrum of large-scale structure on the relevant CMB
four-point correlation functions, we find that there is a bias to estimates of
the CMB lensing power spectrum. For temperature-based lensing reconstruction
with CMB Stage-III and Stage-IV experiments, we find that this lensing power
spectrum bias is negative and is of order one percent of the signal. This
corresponds to a shift of multiple standard deviations for these upcoming
experiments. We caution, however, that our numerical calculation only evaluates
two of the largest bias terms and thus only provides an approximate estimate of
the full bias. We conclude that further investigation into lensing biases from
nonlinear structure formation is required and that these biases should be
accounted for in future lensing analyses.

of the silicon and iron core according to a 1D stellar evolution model with a
self-consistent treatment of core deleptonization and nuclear
quasi-equilibrium. The simulation covers the full solid angle to allow the
emergence of large-scale convective modes. Due to core contraction and the
concomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective Mach number
increases to ~0.1 at collapse, and an l=2 mode emerges shortly before the end
of the simulation. Aside from a growth of the oxygen shell from 0.51 to 0.56
solar masses due to entrainment from the carbon shell, the convective flow is
reasonably well described by mixing length theory, and the dominant scales are
compatible with estimates from linear stability analysis. We deduce that
artificial changes in the physics, such as accelerated core contraction, can
have precarious consequences for the state of convection at collapse. We argue
that scaling laws for the convective velocities and eddy sizes furnish good
estimates for the state of shell convection at collapse and develop a simple
analytic theory for the impact of convective seed perturbations on shock
revival in the ensuing supernova. We predict a reduction of the critical

a finite volume method. The damper is assumed to consist of a shaft, with or
without a spherical bulge, oscillating axially in a containing cylinder filled
with a viscoplastic material of Bingham type. The response of the damper to a
forced sinusoidal displacement is studied. In the bulgeless case the
configuration is the annular analogue of the well-known lid-driven cavity
problem, but with a sinusoidal rather than constant lid velocity. Navier slip
is applied to the shaft surface in order to bound the reaction force to finite
values. Starting from a base case, several problem parameters are varied in
turn in order to study the effects of viscoplasticity, slip, damper geometry
and oscillation frequency to the damper response. The results show that,
compared to Newtonian flow, viscoplasticity causes the damper force to be less
sensitive to the shaft velocity; this is often a desirable damper property. The
bulge increases the required force on the damper mainly by generating a
pressure difference across itself; the latter is larger the smaller the gap
between the bulge and the casing is. At high yield stresses or slip
coefficients the amount of energy dissipation that occurs due to sliding
friction at the shaft-fluid interface is seen to increase significantly. At low
frequencies the flow is in quasi steady state, dominated by viscoplastic
forces, while at higher frequencies the fluid kinetic energy storage and
release also come into the energy balance, introducing hysteresis effects.

from modifying the growth rate of various instabilities to the energization and
mass transport within the magnetosphere. Global multi-fluid simulations using a
full treatment of the pressure tensor are used to evaluate the influence of
temperature anisotropies on the magnetospheric dynamics for an idealized
substorm. The simulations are able to resolve the development of conics over
the polar cap which eventually turn into beams in the lobes. Entry of this
plasma, particularly heavy ions with high Tparallel, leads to a faster
reconnection rate, additional turbulence within the reconnection region, and
the substorm onset time occurs approximately 5 min earlier relative to
isotropic simulations. The anisotropic treatment yields much more intense
auroral currents on the nightside associated with onset and a faster expansion
phase of the substorm. The plasma entering into the current sheet experiences
stronger heating in the anisotropic simulations, which increases plasma
transport into the equatorial dayside. Hence, the convection of the
plasmasphere towards the dayside magnetosphere during the growth phase is
accompanied by a relative increase in Tparallel. This leads to a very distinct
temperature profile on the dayside. The injection of the energetic particles
from the substorm leads to an overall increase Tperpendicular on the dayside,
but only O+ reaches sufficient energies for the bulk of these ions to be able
to cross noon local time during the expansion phase to participate in the
formation of symmetric ring current. The net effect from these processes is to
decrease the cross-polar cap potential, modify the timing of the development of
reconnection and the development of the auroral currents and enhance the
injection of energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere.

comparison and benchmarking can be difficult. In 2012 the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development completed a benchmark study that is
perhaps the most complete published comparison performed. Despite this, various
results from the simulators were often significantly different because of
inconsistencies in modeling decisions involving reprocessing strategies,
refueling behavior, reactor end-of-life handling, etc. This work identifies and
quantifies the effects of selected modeling choices that may sometimes be taken
for granted in the fuel cycle simulation domain. Four scenarios are compared
using combinations of fleet-based or individually modeled reactors with monthly
or quarterly (3-month) time steps. The scenarios approximate a transition from
the current U.S. once-through light water reactor fleet to a full sodium fast
reactor fuel cycle. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator's plug-in capability along
with its market-like dynamic material routing allow it to be used as a level
playing field for comparing the scenarios. When under supply-constraint
pressure, the four cases exhibit noticeably different behavior. Fleet-based
modeling is more efficient in supply-constrained environments at the expense of
losing insight on issues such as realistically suboptimal fuel distribution and
challenges in reactor refueling cycle staggering. Finer-grained time steps
enable more efficient material use in supply-constrained environments resulting
in lower standing inventories of separated Pu. Large simulations with
fleet-based reactors run much more quickly than their individual reactor
counterparts. Gaining a better understanding of how these and other modeling
choices affect fuel cycle dynamics will enable making more deliberate decisions
with respect to trade-offs such as computational investment vs. realism.

external star-forming galaxies. Recent spectral data from a new generation of
radio telescopes enable us to find more robust estimations of the CRE
propagation. We model the synchrotron spectral index of M 51 using the
time-dependent diffusion energy-loss equation and to compare the model results
with the observed spectral index determined from recent low-frequency
observations with LOFAR. This is the first time that this model for CRE
propagation has been solved for a realistic distribution of CRE sources, which
we derive from the observed star formation rate, in an external galaxy. The
radial variation of the synchrotron spectral index and scale-length produced by
the model are compared to recent LOFAR and older VLA observational data and
also to new observations of M 51 at 325MHz obtained with the GMRT. We find that
propagation of CREs by diffusion alone is sufficient to reproduce the observed
spectral index distribution in M 51. An isotropic diffusion coefficient with a
value of $6.6\pm0.2\,\times 10^{28}\mathrm{cm}^2\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is found to
fit best and is similar to what is seen in the Milky Way. We estimate an escape

external influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic
properties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial
time-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal
entanglement and total scrambling. We show that for black hole type quantum
computers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-life
time. Furthermore, we construct explicitly a set of Hamiltonians that generates
a universal set of quantum gates for the black hole type computer. We find that
the gates work at maximal energy efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a
fundamental bound on the complexity of quantum circuits encoded on these
systems, and characterize the unitary operations that are implementable. It
becomes apparent that the computational power is very limited due to the fact
that the black hole life-time is of the same order of the gate operation time.
As a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve its information, within the
life-time of a black hole, by externally coupling to the black hole qubits.
However, we show that, in principle, coupling to some of the internal degrees
of freedom allows acquiring knowledge about the micro-state. Still, due to the
trivial complexity of operations that can be performed, there is no time
advantage over the collection of Hawking radiation and subsequent decoding.

itself. The neutrinos emitted from thermonuclear - type Ia - supernovae also
possess the same potential, although these supernovae are dimmer neutrino
sources. For the first time, we calculate the time, energy, line of sight, and
neutrino-flavor-dependent features of the neutrino signal expected from a
three-dimensional delayed-detonation explosion simulation, where a
deflagration-to-detonation transition triggers the complete disruption of a
near-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We also calculate the
neutrino flavor evolution along eight lines of sight through the simulation as
a function of time and energy using an exact three-flavor transformation code.
We identify a characteristic spectral peak at $\sim 10$ MeV as a signature of
electron captures on copper. This peak is a potentially distinguishing feature
of explosion models since it reflects the nucleosynthesis conditions early in
the explosion. We simulate the event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, and
DUNE neutrino detectors with the SNOwGLoBES event rate calculation software and
also compute the IceCube signal. Hyper-K will be able to detect neutrinos from
our model out to a distance of $\sim 10$ kpc. At 1 kpc, JUNO, Super-K, and DUNE
would register a few events while IceCube and Hyper-K would register several
tens of events.

neutrino flux that is expected to dominate at high energies because long-lived
high-energy pions and kaons interact in the atmosphere before decaying into
neutrinos. We focus on the production of forward charm particles which carry a
large fraction of the momentum of the incident proton. In the case of strange
particles, such a component is familiar from the abundant production of $K^{+}
\Lambda$ pairs. These forward charm particles can dominate the high-energy
atmospheric neutrino flux in underground experiments. Modern collider
experiments have no coverage in the very large rapidity region where charm
forward pair production dominates. Using archival accelerator data as well as
IceCube measurements of atmospheric electron and muon neutrino fluxes, we
obtain an upper limit on forward $\bar{D}^0 \Lambda_c$ pair production and on
the associated flux of high-energy atmospheric neutrinos. We conclude that the
prompt flux may dominate the much-studied central component and represent a
significant contribution to the TeV atmospheric neutrino flux. Importantly, it
cannot accommodate the PeV flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, nor the excess
of events observed by IceCube in the 30--200 TeV energy range indicating either
structure in the flux of cosmic accelerators, or a presence of more than one
component in the cosmic flux observed.

We argue that if the same system is considered in the background of a small

from the vacuum, similar to the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) where photons
are radiated from the vacuum due to time-dependent boundary conditions. The
fundamental technical difficulty for such an analysis is that the radiation of
physical photons on mass shell is inherently a real-time Minkowskian phenomenon
while the vacuum fluctuations interpolating between topological $|k\rangle$
sectors rest upon a Euclidean instanton formulation. We overcome this obstacle
by introducing auxiliary topological fields which allows for a simple
analytical continuation between Minkowski and Euclidean descriptions, and
develop a quantum mechanical technique to compute these effects.

spin wavelets to analyse the spin-2 polarisation signal $P = Q + iU$. The

such systems in narrow-band and spectroscopic surveys is less than 10%,

integral-field instrument to perform a blind survey for giant Ly $\alpha$
nebulae around 17 bright radio-quiet quasars at $3<z<4$ that does not suffer
from most of the limitations of previous surveys. After data reduction and
analysis performed with specifically developed tools, we found that each quasar

physical kpc and, in some cases, extending up to 320 kpc. The circularly
averaged surface brightness profiles of the nebulae appear very similar to each
other despite their different morphologies and are consistent with power laws
with slopes $\approx-1.8$. The similarity between the properties of all these

a large fraction of gas around bright quasars could be in a relatively ""cold""

is ubiquitous within at least 50 kpc from bright quasars at $3<z<4$

creates a drive-dependent skyrmion Hall effect as measured by the change in the

increases linearly with increasing drive, in agreement with recent experimental

regime, $R$ saturates to the disorder-free limit. This behavior is robust for a
wide range of disorder strengths and intrinsic Hall angle values, and occurs
whenever plastic flow is present. For systems with small intrinsic Hall angles,
we find that the Hall angle increases linearly with external drive, as also
observed in experiment. In the weak pinning regime where the skyrmion lattice
depins elastically, $R$ is nonlinear and the net direction of the skyrmion
lattice motion can rotate as a function of external drive.

good properties for preserving sharp edges and contours in objects with spatial

numerous, pairwise different graphs on the very same set of vertices. In the
case of human braingraphs or connectomes, however, this is the standard
situation: the nodes correspond to anatomically identified cerebral regions,
and two vertices are connected by an edge if a diffusion MRI-based workflow
identifies a fiber of axons, running between the two regions, corresponding to
the two vertices. Therefore, if we examine the braingraphs of $n$ subjects,
then we have $n$ graphs on the very same, anatomically identified vertex set.
It is a natural idea to describe the $k$-frequently appearing edges in these
graphs: the edges that are present between the same two vertices in at least
$k$ out of the $n$ graphs. Based on the NIH-funded large Human Connectome
Project's public data release, we have reported the construction of the
Budapest Reference Connectome Server \url{http://connectome.pitgroup.org} that

an edge could be included only if it is present in at least $k$ graphs out of

of these consensus connectomes earlier. In the present work we are focusing on
the frontal lobe of the brain, and we report here a similarly surprising
dynamical property of the consensus connectomes when $k$ is gradually changed
from $k=n$ to $k=1$: the connections between the nodes of the frontal lobe are
seemingly emanating from those nodes that were connected to sub-cortical
structures of the dorsal striatum: the caudate nucleus, and the putamen. We
hypothesize that this dynamic behavior copies the axonal fiber development of
the frontal lobe.

single-particle states connected by $k$-body interactions is studied. These
networks are modeled by embedded Gaussian random matrix ensemble (EGE). The
conductance bandwidth as well as the ensemble-averaged total current attain
their maximal values if the system is highly filled $n \sim l-1$ and $k\sim
n/2$. For the cases $k=1$ and $k=n$ the bandwidth is minimal. We show that for
all parameters the transport is enhanced significantly whenever centrosymmetric
ensemble (csEGE) are considered. In this case the transmission shows numerous
resonances of perfect transport. Analyzing the transmission by spectral
decomposition, we find that centrosymmetry induces strong correlations and
enhances the extrema of the distributions. This suppresses destructive
interference effects in the system and thus, causes backscattering-free
transmission resonances which enhance the overall transport. The distribution
of the total current for the csEGE has a very large dominating peak for
$n=l-1$, close to the highest observed currents.

routing must take into account energy efficiency as well as capacity

accomplished in a real-time, distributed manner that remains robust in the
presence of random disturbances and noise. In view of this, we derive a pricing
scheme whose Nash equilibria coincide with the network's socially optimum
states, and we propose a distributed learning method based on the Boltzmann
distribution of statistical mechanics. Using tools from stochastic calculus, we
show that the resulting Boltzmann routing scheme exhibits remarkable
convergence properties under uncertainty: specifically, the long-term average
of the network's power consumption converges within $\varepsilon$ of its
minimum value in time which is at most $\tilde O(1/\varepsilon^2)$,

global-scale dust storms (GDS) on Mars may occur when periods of circulatory
intensification (associated with positive and negative extrema of the waveform)

change of this waveform, may be unfavorable for the occurrence of GDS, when
they occur during the southern summer dust storm season. These hypotheses are
confirmed through comparisons between calculated dynamical time series of the
time rate of change of orbital angular momentum and historic observations. All
of the nine known global-scale dust storms on Mars took place during Mars years

nonsingular future asymptotes are the Kasner regime in GR as well as
exponential regimes. As of the past asymptotes, for a smooth transition only
Kasner regime in Gauss-Bonnet is an option. With that at hand, we are down only
to two viable regimes -- ""pure"" Kasner regime (transition from high- to

presented. Overall, the joint fitting of metallicity and CMD information can
increase the precision on measured age-metallicity relationships and star
formation rates by ~10% over CMD fitting alone. However, systematics in stellar

determinations can reduce the accuracy of the recovered SFHs. I present a

theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open
to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used
to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.
  In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing
the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a
diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure
flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum.
Since the operator is non-linear, we have to exploit other properties of the
diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning the ""second
eigenvalue"" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that higher order
spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework.
  We consider a stochastic diffusion process, in which each vertex also
experiences Brownian noise from outside the system. We show a relationship
between the second eigenvalue and the convergence behavior of the process.
  We show that various hypergraph parameters like multi-way expansion and
diameter can be bounded using this operator's spectral properties. Since higher
order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead
use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher order Cheeger-like
inequalities. For any positive integer $k$, we give a polynomial time algorithm
to compute an $O(\log r)$-approximation to the $k$-th procedural minimizer,
where $r$ is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this
approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis for constant values of
$k$.

geometric phases (GPs) when corresponding potential energy surfaces undergo

from the GP presence the nuclear quantum dynamics of the CI containing system

new construction of the system with removed GP via a modification of the
diabatic representation for the original CI containing system. Using an
absolute value function of diabatic couplings we remove the GP while preserving
adiabatic potential energy surfaces and CI. We assess GP effects in dynamics of
a two-dimensional linear vibronic coupling model both for ground and excited
state dynamics. Results are compared with those obtained with a conventional
removal of the GP by ignoring double-valued boundary conditions of the real
electronic wave-functions. Interestingly, GP effects appear similar in two
approaches only for the low energy dynamics. In contrast with the conventional
approach, a new approach does not have substantial GP effects in the ultra-fast

remarkably tight with a scatter $\sigma \sim$0.06 dex, or 14%. The scatter does
not change as a function of galaxy luminosity, HI richness or morphological

homogenous radial profile of HI surface density in the outer regions when the
radius is normalised by D$_{\rm HI}$. The early-type disk galaxies typically
have shallower HI radial profiles, indicating a different gas accretion

important problem in dynamic network research is community detection, which
identifies groups of topologically related nodes. Typically, this problem is
approached by assuming either that each time point has a distinct community
organization or that all time points share one community organization. In
reality, the truth likely lies between these two extremes, since some time
periods can have community organization that evolves while others can have
community organization that stays the same. To find the compromise, we consider
community detection in the context of the problem of segment detection, which
identifies contiguous time periods with consistent network structure.
Consequently, we formulate a combined problem of segment community detection
(SCD), which simultaneously partitions the network into contiguous time
segments with consistent community organization and finds this community
organization for each segment. To solve SCD, we introduce SCOUT, an
optimization framework that explicitly considers both segmentation quality and
partition quality. SCOUT addresses limitations of existing methods that can be
adapted to solve SCD, which typically consider only one of segmentation quality
or partition quality. In a thorough evaluation, SCOUT outperforms the existing
methods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity.

along with a Hubble Space Telescope detection of the color and magnitude of the
pre-outburst source. The transient outburst is consistent with dynamically
driven ejecta at the onset of a common envelope episode, which eventually leads
to the complete merger of a binary system. The light curve appears to contain
two components: first $\sim10^{-2} M_\odot$ of fast ejecta driven by shocks at
the onset of common envelope, and later, $\sim0.3 M_\odot$ of further ejecta as
the secondary becomes more deeply engulfed within the primary. Just prior to
merger, we find that the primary star is a $3-5.5 M_\odot$ sub-giant branch
primary star with radius of $30-40R_\odot$. Its position in the color-magnitude
diagram shows that it is growing in radius, consistent with a picture where it
engulfs its companion. By matching the properties of the primary star to the
transient outburst, we show that the optical transient lasts less than ten
orbits of the original binary, which had a pre-merger period of $\sim 10$ days.
We consider the possible orbital dynamics leading up to the merger, and argue
that if the system merged due to the Darwin tidal instability it implies a
lower mass main sequence companion of $0.1-0.6M_\odot$. This analysis
represents a promising step toward a more detailed understanding of flows in
common envelope episodes through direct observational constraints.

direction of the plasma drift of a FDTD Maxwell solver by using a customized
higher order finite difference operator for the spatial derivative along the
direction of the drift ($\hat 1$ direction). We show that this eliminates the
main NCI modes with moderate $\vert k_1 \vert$, while keeps additional main NCI
modes well outside the range of physical interest with higher $\vert k_1

spatial aliasing NCI modes which are also at the edge of the fundamental
Brillouin zone. The customized solver has the possible advantage of improved
parallel scalability because it can be easily partitioned along $\hat 1$ which
typically has many more cells than other directions for the problems of
interest. We show that FFTs can be performed locally to current on each
partition to filter out the main and first spatial aliasing NCI modes, and to
correct the current so that it satisfies the continuity equation for the
customized spatial derivative. This ensures that Gauss' Law is satisfied. We
present simulation examples of one relativistically drifting plasmas, of two
colliding relativistically drifting plasmas, and of nonlinear laser wakefield

MapReduce, the reducer produces an output from a list of inputs. Due to the
scheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in
different order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a
reducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is
undecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for
data analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the
simplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the
commutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to
separate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic
operations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity
problem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming
numerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets
introduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming
transducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are
intrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of
streaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of
SNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of
the values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs.

provide a baseline for monitoring future progress in increasing the

ordinary electron bands at $M$ points in Brillouin zone (BZ). We found that the

which the system dynamically renormalizes the original pairing cutoff
$\Lambda_{sf}$ to $\Lambda_{phys}=\epsilon_b$ ($< \Lambda_{sf}$), therefore
actively eliminates the incipient hole band from forming Cooper pairs, but

deviations in non-atomic selfish routing games. In our model, latencies are
subject to (bounded) deviations which are taken into account by the players.
The quality deterioration caused by such deviations is assessed by the
$\textit{Deviation Ratio}$, i.e., the worst-case ratio of the cost of a Nash
flow with respect to deviated latencies and the cost of a Nash flow with
respect to the unaltered latencies. This notion is inspired by the
$\textit{Price of Risk Aversion}$ recently studied by Nikolova and Stier-Moses.
Here we generalize their model and results. In particular, we derive tight
bounds on the Deviation Ratio for multi-commodity instances with a common
source and arbitrary non-negative and non-decreasing latency functions. These
bounds exhibit a linear dependency on the size of the network (besides other
parameters). In contrast, we show that for general multi-commodity networks an
exponential dependency is inevitable. We also improve recent smoothness results

symmetry breaking. This definition can be used in any approach to Effective
Field Theory, from perturbation theory to lattice simulations. It allows us to
study the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries without assuming that the
local gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is important since
perturbation theory is insufficient to study extended Higgs sectors: it is
insufficient to predict the physical spectrum of the SU(5) Grand Unified Theory
(Georgi-Glashow) or to predict the spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries.
  We also study background symmetries: these are symmetries that despite they
are already explicitly broken, can be still spontaneously broken. We analyse
examples where a background CP (charge-parity) symmetry is not spontaneously
broken: in the Standard Model, in rephasing symmetries and in geometrical
CP-violation.
  We show that all fields are real representations of the group of symmetries,
since CP is a unitary transformation. There are consequences: to study
accidental symmetries (e.g. custodial symmetry, pseudo-golstone bosons) we must
consider real representations; CP is a symmetry of order 4 if the neutrinos are
Majorana particles and the notion of CP-violating phases is inconsistent in
some Lagrangians; a recent claim that a toy model exhibits physical
CP-violation while the CP symmetry is conserved by the Lagrangian and the

equations of motion in such a system and by using the von Neumann entropy, the
degree of entanglement (DEM) could be measured in semi classical regime and in
the multi-photon resonance condition. We interested in investigating the
maximum value for DEM and controlled the DEM via relative phase. At first we
consider three laser fields as CW optical laser fields and one femtosecond
Gaussian field. In this case DEM has interesting behavior. When the system is
applied by the other laser fields and Gaussian pulse is still there DEM can be
controlled via phase but after finishing the time duration of the femtosecond
Gaussian pulse DEM will be phase independent. Then we consider all the laser
fields as femtosecond Gaussian pulses which interact with atomic system and we
achieve to this point that the steady state entanglement can be occurred by
using such ultra-short laser pulses; in this situation DEM will be phase
independent. The system would be disentangled in special parameters of Rabi
frequencies and all the atoms are coherently populated in a dark state in
dressed state picture. Moreover when the system is entangled, there is a
population distribution of the atoms in dressed states.

framework is composed by promising application-specific preconditioners
presented previously in the literature with the common feature that they are
able to be implemented for a generic coupled problem, involving an arbitrary
number of fields, and to be used to solve a variety of applications. The first
selected preconditioner is based on a generic block Gauss-Seidel iteration for
uncoupling the fields, and standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for
solving the resulting uncoupled problems. The second preconditioner is based on
the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) which is
extended here to deal with an arbitrary number of fields, and also results in
uncoupled problems that can be solved with standard AMG. Finally, a more
sophisticated preconditioner is considered which enforces the coupling at all
AMG levels, in contrast to the other two techniques which resolve the coupling
only at the finest level. Our purpose is to show that these methods perform
satisfactory in quite different scenarios apart from their original
applications. To this end, we consider three very different coupled problems:
thermo-structure interaction, fluid-structure interaction and a complex model
of the human lung. Numerical results show that these general purpose methods
are efficient and scalable in this range of applications.

derive the IGL and the extrapolated-IGL in all bands. We argue undetected low

our extrapolated-IGL measurements are an accurate representation of the
extra-galactic background light. Our data agree with most earlier IGL estimates
and with direct measurements in the far-IR, but disagree strongly with direct
estimates in the optical. Close agreement between our results and recent very
high-energy experiments (H.E.S.S. and MAGIC), suggest that there may be an
additional foreground affecting the direct estimates. The most likely culprit

high-$z$ galaxies constrain the cut-off halo circular velocity below which
star-formation is suppressed by photo-ionization feedback to $v_c^{\rm cut} <

$\approx5.6\times10^9~M_\odot$ and $\approx2.3\times10^9~M_\odot$ at $z=5$ and

show that, in addition to its by now common application to state estimation, DA
may be used for model selection. An important special case of the latter is the
discrimination between a factual model --- which corresponds, to the best of
the modeler's knowledge, to the situation in the actual world in which a
sequence of events has occurred --- and a counterfactual model, in which a
particular forcing or process might be absent or just quantitatively different
from the actual world. Three different ensemble-DA methods are reviewed for
this purpose: the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble four-dimensional
variational smoother (En-4D-Var), and the iterative ensemble Kalman smoother
(IEnKS). An original contextual formulation of model evidence (CME) is
introduced. It is shown how to apply these three methods to compute CME, using
the approximated time-dependent probability distribution functions (pdfs) each
of them provide in the process of state estimation. The theoretical formulae so
derived are applied to two simplified nonlinear and chaotic models: (i) the
Lorenz three-variable convection (L63) model, and (ii) the Lorenz 40-variable
mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics model (L95). The numerical results of these
three DA-based methods and those of an integration based on importance sampling
are compared. It is found that better CME estimates are obtained by using DA,
and the IEnKS method appears to be best among the DA methods. Differences among
the performance of the three DA-based methods are discussed as a function of
model properties. Finally, the methodology is implemented for parameter
estimation and for event attribution.

investigate here the impact of a nonequilibrium phase transition found in such
systems, where the tracer species carries a finite fraction of the total
kinetic energy (ordered phase). To this end, the diffusion coefficients are
first obtained for a granular binary mixture in spatially inhomogeneous states
close to the simple shear flow. In this situation, the set of coupled Boltzmann
equations are solved by means of a Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around the
(local) shear flow distributions for each species, thereby retaining all the
hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate $a$. Due to the anisotropy induced by the
shear flow, three tensorial quantities $D_{ij}$, $D_{p,ij}$, and $D_{T,ij}$ are
required to describe the mass transport process instead of the conventional
scalar coefficients. These tensors are given in terms of the solutions of a set
of coupled algebraic equations, which can be \emph{exactly} solved as functions
of the shear rate $a$, the coefficients of restitution $\alpha_{sr}$ and the
parameters of the mixture (masses and composition). Once the forms of $D_{ij}$,
$D_{p,ij}$, and $D_{T,ij}$ are obtained for arbitrary mole fraction
$x_1=n_1/(n_1+n_2)$ (where $n_r$ is the number density of species $r$), the
tracer limit ($x_1\to 0$) is carefully considered for the above three diffusion
tensors. Explicit forms for these coefficients are derived showing that their

  59 pages, 21 figures",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Even a first approximation of bound states requires contributions of all
powers in the coupling. This means that the concept of ""lowest order bound
state"" needs to be defined. In these lectures I discuss the ""Born"" (no loop,
lowest order in $\hbar$) approximation. Born level states are bound by gauge
fields which satisfy the classical field equations.
  As a check of the method, Positronium states of any momentum are determined
as eigenstates of the QED Hamiltonian, quantized at equal time. Analogously,
states bound by a strong external field $A^\mu(\boldsymbol{x})$ are found as
eigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian. Their Fock states have dynamically
created $e^+e^-$ pairs, whose distribution is determined by the Dirac wave
function. The linear potential of $D=1+1$ dimensions confines electrons but
repels positrons. As a result, the mass spectrum is continuous and the wave
functions have features of both bound states and plane waves.
  The classical solutions of Gauss' law are explored for hadrons in QCD. A
non-vanishing boundary condition at spatial infinity generates a constant
\order{\alpha_s^0} color electric field between quarks of specific colors.
Poincar\'e invariance limits the spectrum to color singlet $q\bar q$ and $qqq$
states, which do not generate an external color field. This restricts the
\order{\alpha_s^0} interactions between hadrons to string breaking dynamics as
in dual diagrams. Light mesons lie on linear Regge and parallel daughter
trajectories. There are massless states which may be significant for chiral
symmetry breaking. Since the bound states are defined at equal time in all
frames they have a non-trivial Lorentz covariance.

instrumented with hundreds of sensors. Using such data to detect anomalous
behaviour is critical for safety and efficient maintenance. However, anomalies
occur rarely and with great variety in such systems, so there is often
insufficient anomalous data to build reliable detectors. A standard approach to
mitigate this problem is to use one class methods relying only on data from
normal behaviour. Unfortunately, even these approaches are more likely to fail
in the scenario of a dynamical system with manual control input(s). Normal
behaviour in response to novel control input(s) might look very different to
the learned detector which may be incorrectly detected as anomalous. In this
paper, we address this issue by modelling time-series via Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODE) and utilising such an ODE model to simulate the behaviour of
dynamical systems under varying control inputs. The available data is then
augmented with data generated from the ODE, and the anomaly detector is
retrained on this augmented dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ODE-augmented
training data allows better coverage of possible control input(s) and results
in learning more accurate distinctions between normal and anomalous behaviour
in time-series.

functions to be Gaussian and their widths to be site dependent. We find that
the radiated heat from the slab does not receive any correction at the leading

appropriate choice of the widths. We observe that in the steady state limit
entire slab becomes an assembly of $N$ different thermally equilibriated

flow. We find an exponentially falling nature of the temperature profile as its
leading behaviour and its non-leading behaviour is governed by the two site

thermal conductivity remains independent of the environment temperature and is
dependent only on the difference of temperature of the extreme surfaces
linearly at the leading order of anharmonic coupling. We find that owing to
finiteness of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, Fourier's law holds to

the pencil $R(z)=1+z_1a+z_2t$ is obtained, and it is used to compute the first
singular homology group of the joint resolvent set $P^c(R)$. The joint spectrum
gives new insight into some earlier studies on groups of intermediate growth,
through which the corresponding joint spectrum of $(1,\ a,\ t)$ with respect to
the Koopman representation $\rho$ (constructed through a self-similar action of
$D_{\infty}$ on a binary tree) can be computed. It turns out that the joint
spectra with respect to the two representations coincide. Interestingly, this
fact leads to a self-similar realization of the group $C^*$-algebra
$C^*(D_{\infty})$. This self-similarity of $C^*(D_{\infty})$ is manifested by
some dynamical properties of the joint spectrum.

drawbacks such as the introduction of significant insertion losses,
particularly pronounced in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)

the energy efficiency sense, we further consider partially-connected switching
networks as an alternative switching architecture with reduced hardware
complexity, which we characterize in this work. In this context, we also
analyze the impact of reduced switching connectivity on the analog hardware and
digital signal processing of AS schemes that rely on channel power information.
Overall, the analytical and simulation results shown in this paper demonstrate
that partially-connected switching maximizes the energy efficiency of massive

order book on a stock market. This model was independently rediscovered and
generalized by H. Luckock in 2003. In his formulation, traders place buy and
sell limit orders of unit size according to independent Poisson processes with
possibly different intensities. Newly arriving buy (sell) orders are either
immediately matched to the best available matching sell (buy) order or stay in
the order book until a matching order arrives. Assuming stationarity, Luckock
showed that the distribution functions of the best buy and sell order in the
order book solve a differential equation, from which he was able to calculate
the position of two prices $J^{\rm c}_-<J^{\rm c}_+$ such that buy orders below
$J^{\rm c}_-$ and sell orders above $J^{\rm c}_+$ stay in the order book
forever while all other orders are eventually matched. We extend Luckock's
model by adding market orders, i.e., with a certain rate traders arrive at the
market that take the best available buy or sell offer in the order book, if
there is one, and do nothing otherwise. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for such an extended model to be positive recurrent and show how
these conditions are related to the prices $J^{\rm c}_-$ and $J^{\rm c}_+$ of
Luckock.

implies that the NLS1s and BLS1s have similar black hole masses and Eddington

two different deposited energy intervals, [10 TeV $-$ 10 PeV] and [60 TeV $-$

constrain its shape, normalization and flavor composition. Our results are in
agreement with the preliminary IceCube results, although we obtain a slightly
softer spectrum. We also find that current data are not sensitive to a possible
neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the astrophysical flux. Then, we show that
although a two-component power-law model leads to a slightly better fit, it
does not represent a significant improvement with respect to a single power-law
flux. Finally, we analyze the possible existence of a North-South asymmetry,
hinted at by the combination of the HESE sample with the through-going muon
data. If only using HESE data, the scarce statistics from the northern
hemisphere does not allow us to reach any conclusive answer, which indicates
that the HESE sample alone is not driving the potential North-South asymmetry.

  infrastructure with a single muon detector","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-energy muons generated from cosmic-ray particle showers have been shown
to exhibit properties ideal for imaging the interior of large structures. This
paper explores the possibility of using a single portable muon detector in
conjunction with image reconstruction methods used in nuclear medicine to
reconstruct a 3D image of the interior of critical infrastructure such as the
Zero Energy Deuterium (ZED-2) research reactor at Canadian Nuclear
Laboratories' Chalk River site. The ZED-2 reactor core and muon detector
arrangement are modeled in GEANT4 and Monte Carlo measurements of the resultant
muon throughput and angular distribution at several angles of rotation around
the reactor are generated. Statistical analysis is then performed on these
measurements based on the well-defined flux and angular distribution of muons
expected near the surface of the earth. The results of this analysis are shown
to produce reconstructed images of the spatial distribution of nuclear fuel
within the core for multiple fuel configurations. This one-sided tomography
concept is a possible candidate for examining the internal structure of larger
critical facilities, for example the Fukushima Daiichi power plant where the
integrity of the containment infrastructure and the location of the reactor
fuel is unknown.

local order and bond connectivity. We investigate both effects by
molecular-dynamics simulations on melts of fully-flexible linear chains ranging
from dimers ($M=2$) up to entangled polymers ($M=200$). The corresponding
atomic liquid is also considered as reference system. To disentangle the
influence of the local geometry and the bond arrangements, and reveal their
interplay, we define suitable measures of the anisotropy emphasising either the
former or the latter aspect. Connectivity anisotropy, as measured by the
correlation between the initial bond orientation and the direction of the
subsequent monomer displacement, shows a slight enhancement due to the local
order at times shorter than the structural relaxation time. At intermediate
times - when the monomer displacement is comparable to the bond length - a
pronounced peak and then decays slowly as $t^{-1/2}$, becoming negligible when
the displacements is as large as about five bond lengths, i.e. about four
monomer diameters or three Kuhn lengths. Local-geometry anisotropy, as measured
by the correlation between the initial orientation of a characteristic axis of
the Voronoi cell and the subsequent monomer dynamics, is affected at shorter
times than the structural relaxation time by the cage shape with antagonistic
disturbance by the connectivity. Differently, at longer times, the connectivity
favours the persistence of the local-geometry anisotropy which vanishes when
the monomer displacement exceeds the bond length. Our results strongly suggest
that the sole consideration of the local order is not enough to understand the
microscopic origin of the rattling amplitude of the trapped monomer in the cage

that store and make available recordings of human motions. However, annotating
each motion with multiple labels is a cumbersome and error-prone process. This
bachelor's thesis presents different approaches to solve the multi-label
classification problem using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). First, different
features that can be directly obtained from the raw data are introduced. Next,
additional features are derived to improve classification performance. These
features are then used to perform the multi-label classification using two
different approaches. The first approach simply transforms the multi-label
problem into a multi-class problem. The second, novel approach solves the same
problem without the need to construct a transformation by predicting the labels
directly from the likelihood scores. The second approach scales linearly with
the number of labels whereas the first approach is subject to combinatorial
explosion. All aspects of the classification process are evaluated on a data
set that consists of 454 motions. System 1 achieves an accuracy of 98.02% and
system 2 an accuracy of 93.39% on the test set.

interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data, where
the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism, is sometimes available.
Under some strong assumptions, observational data allows for the estimation of
dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample
sizes for controlled interventions may be small, while in the observational
case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In
this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs
a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational
data, and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform
learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different
sources is shown to speed-up learning, which we demonstrate with a thorough
sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on
cognitive skills of premature infants.

theorems derived from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, we
investigate the angular momentum independence of the entropy sum as well as the
entropy product of general rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes in higher
dimensions. We show that for both non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes
and non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein-AdS black holes, the angular momentum of
the black holes will not be present in entropy sum relation in dimensions
$d\geq4$, while the independence of angular momentum of the entropy product
holds provided that the black holes possess at least one zero rotation
parameter $a_j$ = 0 in higher dimensions $d\geq5$, which means that the
cosmological constant does not affect the angular momentum-free property of
entropy sum and entropy product under the circumstances that charge $\delta=0$.
For the reason that the entropy relations of charged rotating Kaluza-Klein
black holes as well as the non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes in
asymptotically flat spacetime act the same way, it is found that the charge has
no effect in the angular momentum-independence of entropy sum and product in
asymptotically flat spactime.

general linear model is applied and sample size is small. Here we studied the
performances of some of the available analytic methods applicable to the
analysis of proportion data; namely linear regression, Poisson regression,
beta-binomial regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We report
the conclusions from a simulation study evaluating power and Type I error rates

differing in sample size, cluster size and fixed effects parameters; plus, we
describe results from the application of these methods on data from two real

regression are powerful instruments for the analysis of clustered binary
outcomes, linear approximation can still provide reliable hypothesis testing in
this context. Poisson regression, on the other hand, can suffer heavily from
model misspecification when used to model proportion data. We conclude
providing some guidelines for the choice of appropriate analytical instruments,

Monte Carlo methods with multiple random walkers, particularly in the
Wang-Landau (WL) and $1/t$ algorithms. The classical algorithms are modified by
the use of $m$ independent random walkers in the energy landscape to calculate
the density of states (DOS). The Ising model is used to show the convergence
properties in the calculation of the DOS, as well as the critical temperature,
while the calculation of the number $\pi$ by multiple dimensional integration
is used in the continuum approximation. In each case, the error is obtained
separately for each walker at a fixed time, $t$; then, the average over $m$
walkers is performed. It is observed that the error goes as $1/\sqrt{m}$.
However, if the number of walkers increases above a certain critical value
$m>m_x$, the error reaches a constant value (i.e. it saturates). This occurs
for both algorithms; however, it is shown that for a given system, the $1/t$
algorithm is more efficient and accurate than the similar version of the WL
algorithm. It follows that it makes no sense to increase the number of walkers
above a critical value $m_x$, since it does not reduces the error in the
calculation. Therefore, the number of walkers does not guarantee convergence.

ubiquitous in real world applications such as crowdsourcing. To handle noisy
labels, in this paper, we present a family of robust losses for SGD methods. By
employing our robust losses, SGD methods successfully reduce negative effects

far-reaching analogies are established among (anti-) cooperative collective
behaviors in chemical kinetics, (anti-)ferromagnetic spin models in statistical
mechanics and operational amplifiers/flip-flops in cybernetics. The underlying
modeling -- based on spin systems -- has been proved to be accurate for a wide
class of systems matching classical (e.g. Michaelis--Menten, Hill, Adair)
scenarios in the infinite-size approximation. However, the current research in
biochemical information processing has been focusing on systems involving a
relatively small number of units, where this approximation is no longer valid.
Here we show that the whole statistical mechanical description of reaction
kinetics can be re-formulated via a mechanical analogy -- based on completely
integrable hydrodynamic-type systems of PDEs -- which provides explicit
finite-size solutions, matching recently investigated phenomena (e.g.
noise-induced cooperativity, stochastic bi-stability, quorum sensing). The

Auger Observatory to extend its range of detection and to directly measure the
muon content of the particle showers. It consists of an infill of surface
water-Cherenkov detectors accompanied by buried scintillator detectors used for
muon counting. The main objectives of the AMIGA engineering array, referred to
as the Unitary Cell, are to identify and resolve all engineering issues as well
as to understand the muon-number counting uncertainties related to the design
of the detector. The mechanical design, fabrication and deployment processes of
the muon counters of the Unitary Cell are described in this document. These
muon counters modules comprise sealed PVC casings containing plastic
scintillation bars, wavelength-shifter optical fibers, 64 pixel photomultiplier
tubes, and acquisition electronics. The modules are buried approximately 2.25 m
below ground level in order to minimize contamination from electromagnetic
shower particles. The mechanical setup, which allows access to the electronics
for maintenance, is also described in addition to tests of the modules'
response and integrity. The completed Unitary Cell has measured a number of air
showers of which a first analysis of a sample event is included here.

(if P($\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{\mu}) \neq \mbox{P}(\nu_{\mu}

$\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$-enhanced neutrino beam corresponding to $4.01 \times 10^{20}$
protons on target (roughly $1/3$ of the total protons on target collected by
T2K). We present world-leading measurements of $\Delta \bar{m}^2_{32}$ and
$\sin^2\bar{\theta}_{23}$ and the first analysis of $\bar{\nu}_e$ appearance

  Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Ad-hoc Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the secondary users (SUs) sense the
spectrum licensed to the primary users (PUs) to identify and possibly transmit
over temporarily unoccupied channels. Cooperative sensing was proposed to
improve the sensing accuracy, but in heterogeneous scenarios SUs do not
contribute equally to the cooperative sensing result because they experience
different received PU signal quality at their sensors. In this paper, a
two-layer coalitional game is developed for distributed sensing and access in
multichannel CR ad hoc networks where the SUs' transmission opportunities are
commensurate with their sensing contributions, thus fostering cooperation and
eliminating free-riders. Numerical results show that the proposed two-layer
game is computationally efficient and outperforms previously investigated
collaborative sensing and spectrum access approaches for heterogeneous
multichannel CR networks in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, SU
fairness, and complexity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this game is robust
to changes in the network topology and the number of SUs in low-mobility
scenarios. Finally, we propose a new physical-layer approach to distributing
the network-level miss-detection (MD) constraints fairly among the interfering
SUs for guaranteed PU protection and demonstrate the performance advantages of
the AND-rule combining of spectrum sensing results for heterogeneous SUs.

parameter that forms domain walls, of the type encountered in

domain wall is inherently anisotropic and non-local. Bound states in the
nonuniform region play a crucial role and control heat transport in several
ways: (i) they modify the spectrum of quasiparticle states and result in
Andreev reflection processes, and (ii) they hybridize with impurity band and
produce local transport environment with properties very different from those
in uniform superconductor. As a result of this interplay, heat transport
becomes highly sensitive to temperature, magnetic field and disorder. For
strongly scattering impurities we find that the transport across domain walls
at low temperatures is considerably more efficient than in the uniform

speaker recognition system for conversational speech. Some of the key
advancements that contribute to our system include: a nearest-neighbor
discriminant analysis (NDA) approach (as opposed to LDA) for intersession
variability compensation in the i-vector space, the application of speaker and
channel-adapted features derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR)
system for speaker recognition, and the use of a DNN acoustic model with a very
large number of output units (~10k senones) to compute the frame-level soft
alignments required in the i-vector estimation process. We evaluate these
techniques on the NIST 2010 SRE extended core conditions (C1-C9), as well as
the 10sec-10sec condition. To our knowledge, results achieved by our system
represent the best performances published to date on these conditions. For
example, on the extended tel-tel condition (C5) the system achieves an EER of
0.59%. To garner further understanding of the remaining errors (on C5), we
examine the recordings associated with the low scoring target trials, where
various issues are identified for the problematic recordings/trials.
Interestingly, it is observed that correcting the pathological recordings not
only improves the scores for the target trials but also for the nontarget
trials.

linear filter cascaded with a thresholding nonlinearity, which collectively
resemble a typical neural network layer. Consequently, a lengthy sequence of
algorithm iterations can be viewed as a deep network with shared, hand-crafted
layer weights. It is therefore quite natural to examine the degree to which a
learned network model might act as a viable surrogate for traditional sparse
estimation in domains where ample training data is available. While the
possibility of a reduced computational budget is readily apparent when a
ceiling is imposed on the number of layers, our work primarily focuses on
estimation accuracy. In particular, it is well-known that when a signal
dictionary has coherent columns, as quantified by a large RIP constant, then
most tractable iterative algorithms are unable to find maximally sparse
representations. In contrast, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
the potential for a trained deep network to recover minimal $\ell_0$-norm
representations in regimes where existing methods fail. The resulting system is
deployed on a practical photometric stereo estimation problem, where the goal
is to remove sparse outliers that can disrupt the estimation of surface normals

Laplacian eigenfunction maps into $\mathbb{R}^m$ for some $m$. We call the
smallest such $m$ the maximal embedding dimension of $M$. We show that the
maximal embedding dimension of $M$ is bounded from above by a constant
depending only on the dimension of $M$, a lower bound for injectivity radius, a
lower bound for Ricci curvature, and a volume bound. We interpret this result
for the case of surfaces isometrically immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, showing that
the maximal embedding dimension only depends on bounds for the Gaussian
curvature, mean curvature, and surface area. Furthermore, we consider the
relevance of these results for shape registration.

these RMSs through molecular line (N2H+ (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0)) observations.
Most of the detected N2H+ and HCO+ emissions match well with the dust emission,
implying a close link to their chemical evolution in the RMSs. We found that
the abundance of N2H+ is one order of magnitude lower than that in other
surveys of infrared dark clouds, and a positive correlation between the
abundances of N2H+ and HCO+. The fractional abundance of N2H+ with respect to
H2 seems to decrease as a function of NL. These observed trends could be
interpreted as an indication of enhanced destruction of N2H+, either by CO or
through dissociative recombination with electrons produced by central UV

hyper- and high-inflation in economy is proposed in the present work. In the
NLF model the consumer price index (CPI) exhibits a finite time singularity of
the type $1/(t_c -t)^{(1- \beta)/\beta}$, with $\beta>0$, predicting a blow up
of the economy at a critical time $t_c$. However, this model fails in
determining $t_c$ in the case of weak hyperinflation regimes like, e.g., that
occurred in Israel. To overcome this trouble, the NLF model is extended by
introducing a parameter $\gamma$, which multiplies all therms with past growth
rate index (GRI). In this novel approach the solution for CPI is also analytic
being proportional to the Gaussian hypergeometric function
$_2F_1(1/\beta,1/\beta,1+1/\beta;z)$, where $z$ is a function of $\beta$,
$\gamma$, and $t_c$. For $z \to 1$ this hypergeometric function diverges
leading to a finite time singularity, from which a value of $t_c$ can be
determined. This singularity is also present in GRI. It is shown that the
interplay between parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ may produce phenomena of
multiple equilibria. An analysis of the severe hyperinflation occurred in
Hungary proves that the novel model is robust. When this model is used for
examining data of Israel a reasonable $t_c$ is got. High-inflation regimes in
Mexico and Iceland, which exhibit weaker inflations than that of Israel, are
also successfully described.

restrictions may be removed. Furthermore, three physically important cases $A
\in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ are shown to lie deep within the allowed interval of $A$ for
all values of $\rho$. For the model of linearized Navier-Stokes equations ($A =
-1$) up to date unknown helical values of turbulent Prandtl number have been
shown to equal $1$ regardless of parity violation. Furthermore, we have shown
that interaction parameter $A$ exerts strong influence on advection diffusion
processes in turbulent environments with broken spatial parity. In explicit,
depending on actual value of $A$ turbulent Prandtl number may increase or
decrease with $\rho$. By varying $A$ continuously we explain high stability of
kinematic MHD model ($A=1$) against helical effects as a result of its
closeness to $A = 0.912$ (rounded on the last presented digit) case where
helical effects are completely suppressed. Contrary, for the physically
important $A=0$ model we show that it lies deep within the interval of models
where helical effects cause the turbulent Prandtl number to decrease with
$|\rho|$. We thus identify internal structure of interactions given by
parameter $A$, and not the vector character of the admixture itself to be the
dominant factor influencing diffusion advection processes in the helical $A$
model.
