configurations in the TORPEX device via a non-field-aligned coordinate system,
using an isothermal model which evolves density, vorticity, parallel velocity
and parallel current density. By modifying the parallel gradient operator to
include perpendicular perturbations from poloidal field coils, numerical
singularities associated with field aligned coordinates are avoided. A
comparison with a previously developed analytical model is performed and an
agreement is found with minimal modification. Experimental comparison
determines that the null region can cause an acceleration of filaments due to
increasing connection length, but this acceleration is small relative to other
effects, which we quantify. Experimental measurements are reproduced, and the
dominant acceleration mechanism is identified as that of a developing dipole in
a moving background. Contributions from increasing connection length close to
the null point are a small correction.

governments in affected areas. Streaming social media content, such as Twitter,
is increasingly being used for health vigilance applications such as flu
detection. However, previous work has not addressed the complexity of drastic
seasonal changes on Twitter content across multiple epidemic outbreaks. In
order to address this gap, this paper contrasts two complementary approaches to
detecting Twitter content that is relevant for Dengue outbreak detection,
namely supervised classification and unsupervised clustering using topic
modelling. Each approach has benefits and shortcomings. Our classifier achieves
a prediction accuracy of about 80\% based on a small training set of about
1,000 instances, but the need for manual annotation makes it hard to track
seasonal changes in the nature of the epidemics, such as the emergence of new
types of virus in certain geographical locations. In contrast, LDA-based topic
modelling scales well, generating cohesive and well-separated clusters from
larger samples. While clusters can be easily re-generated following changes in
epidemics, however, this approach makes it hard to clearly segregate relevant
tweets into well-defined clusters.

we develop an EPR source to supply Bell-type states for the teleportation, and
show how the same set-up can also be used as a Bell-state analyser (BSA) when

together to complete the teleportation protocol in a scheme that can deliver
perfect fidelity, albeit with an efficiency that decays exponentially as the

ordering phenomena on the large scale. In physical systems order is
statistically robust for large enough dimensions, with relative fluctuations
due to noise vanishing with system size. Several biological systems, however,
are less stable than their physical analogues and spontaneously change their
global state on relatively short timescales. In this paper we show that there
are two crucial ingredients in these systems that enhance the effect of noise,
leading to collective changes of state: the non-symmetric nature of
interactions between individuals, and the presence of local heterogeneities in
the topology of the network. The consequences of these features can be larger
the larger the system size leading to a localization of the fluctuation modes
and a relaxation time that remains finite in the thermodynamic limit. The
system keeps changing its global state in time, being constantly driven out of
equilibrium by spontaneous fluctuations. Our results explain what is observed
in several living and social systems and are consistent with recent
experimental data on bird flocks and other animal groups.

Atmospheric loss led to depressurization and cooling, and is thought to be the
primary driving force responsible for the loss of liquid water from its
surface. Recently, MAVEN observations have provided new insight into the
physics of atmospheric loss induced by ICMEs and solar wind interacting with
the Martian atmosphere. In addition to solar radiation, it is likely that its
atmosphere has been exposed to radiation bursts from high-energy astrophysical
sources which become highly probable on timescales of ~Gy and beyond. These
sources are capable of significantly enhancing the rates of photoionization and
charged particle-induced ionization in the upper atmosphere. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to model the interaction of charged particles and photons from
astrophysical sources in the upper Martian atmosphere and discuss its
implications on atmospheric loss. Our calculations suggest that the passage of
the solar system though dense interstellar clouds is the most significant

  appeared in the Notices of the AMS, May 2016",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum computers are hypothetical devices, based on quantum physics, that
would enable us to perform certain computations hundreds of orders of magnitude
faster than digital computers. This feature is coined as ""quantum supremacy""
and one aspect or another of such quantum computational supremacy might be
brought about in experiments in the near future: by implementing quantum
error-correction, systems of non-interacting bosons, exotic new phases of
matter called anyons, quantum annealing, or in various other ways.
  A main concern regarding the feasibility of quantum computers is that quantum
systems are inherently noisy: we cannot accurately control them, and we cannot
accurately describe them. We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum
noise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that
wouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses.
  Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as
explained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of
noise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small
scale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum
evolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational
power. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior
of noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow
reaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy,
making them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel
implicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on
the behavior of noisy quantum systems.

learn about the dark sector of the universe. To extract the WL signal from
astronomical observations, galaxy shapes must be measured and corrected for the
point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system with extreme accuracy. Future
WL missions (such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, WFIRST) will use
a family of hybrid nearinfrared CMOS detectors (HAWAII-4RG) that are untested
for accurate WL measurements. Like all image sensors, these devices are subject
to conversion gain nonlinearities (voltage response to collected photo-charge)
that bias the shape and size of bright objects such as reference stars that are
used in PSF determination. We study this type of detector nonlinearity (NL) and
show how to derive requirements on it from WFIRST PSF size and ellipticity
requirements. We simulate the PSF optical profiles expected for WFIRST and
measure the fractional error in the PSF size and the absolute error in the PSF
ellipticity as a function of star magnitude and the NL model. For our nominal
NL model (a quadratic correction), we find that, uncalibrated, NL can induce an
error of 0.01 (fractional size) and 0.00175 (absolute ellipticity error) in the
H158 bandpass for the brightest unsaturated stars in WFIRST. In addition, our
simulations show that to limit the bias of the size and ellipticity errors in
the H158 band to approximately 10% of the estimated WFIRST error budget, the
parameter of our quadratic NL model must be calibrated to about 1% and 2.4%,

deriving upper and lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the
dimension. First, we consider the problem of testing the hypothesis that the
support of the data-generating probability distribution is a well-behaved
manifold of intrinsic dimension $d_1$ versus the alternative that it is of
dimension $d_2$, with $d_{1}<d_{2}$. With an i.i.d. sample of size $n$, we
provide an upper bound on the probability of choosing the wrong dimension of
$O\left( n^{-\left(d_{2}/d_{1}-1-\epsilon\right)n} \right)$, where $\epsilon$
is an arbitrarily small positive number. The proof is based on bounding the
length of the traveling salesman path through the data points. We also
demonstrate a lower bound of $\Omega \left( n^{-(2d_{2}-2d_{1}+\epsilon)n}

probability distributions. We then extend these results to get minimax rates
for estimating the dimension of well-behaved manifolds. We obtain an upper
bound of order $O \left( n^{-(\frac{1}{m-1}-\epsilon)n} \right)$ and a lower
bound of order $\Omega \left( n^{-(2+\epsilon)n} \right)$, where $m$ is the

of intense interest for over a decade due to their rich physics and potential

where efforts are invested in developing devices. It is critical now to
understand the functionalities and limitations of such devices. Recent scanning
probe measurements of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface have revealed locally
enhanced current flow and accumulation of charge along channels related to
SrTiO3 structural domains. These observations raised a key question regarding
the role these modulations play in the macroscopic properties of devices. Here
we show that the microscopic picture, mapped by scanning superconducting
quantum interference device, accounts for a substantial part of the
macroscopically measured transport anisotropy. We compared local flux data with
transport values, measured simultaneously, over various SrTiO3 domain
configurations. We show a clear relation between maps of local current density
over specific domain configurations and the measured anisotropy for the same
device. The domains divert the direction of current flow, resulting in a
direction dependent resistance. We also show that the modulation can be
significant and that in some cases up to 95% of the current is modulated over
the channels. The orientation and distribution of the SrTiO3 structural domains
change between different cooldowns of the same device or when electric fields
are applied, affecting the device behavior. Our results, highlight the
importance of substrate physics, and in particular, the role of structural

Embedded Discontinuous Galerkin (IEDG) method for the discretization of the

solver for the resulting nonlinear system of equations. The IEDG method arises
from the marriage of the Embedded Discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method and the
Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. As such, the IEDG method
inherits the advantages of both the EDG method and the HDG method to make
itself well-suited for turbulence simulations. We propose a minimal residual
Newton algorithm for solving the nonlinear system arising from the IEDG
discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. The preconditioned GMRES
algorithm is based on a restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner in
conjunction with a block incomplete LU factorization at the subdomain level.
The proposed approach is applied to the ILES of transitional turbulent flows
over a NACA 65-(18)10 compressor cascade at Reynolds number 250,000 in both
design and off-design conditions. The high-order ILES results show good
agreement with a subgrid-scale LES model discretized with a second-order finite

powerful information theoretical framework---the Mutual Information

We require that the mutual information measurement has the key property that
any ""data processing"" on the two random variables will decrease the mutual
information between them. We identify such information measures that generalize
Shannon mutual information.
  Our Mutual Information Paradigm overcomes the two main challenges in
information elicitation without verification: (1) how to incentivize effort and
avoid agents colluding to report random or identical responses (2) how to
motivate agents who believe they are in the minority to report truthfully.
  Aided by the information measures we found, (1) we use the paradigm to design
a family of novel mechanisms where truth-telling is a dominant strategy and any
other strategy will decrease every agent's expected payment (in the
multi-question, detail free, minimal setting where the number of questions is
large); (2) we show the versatility of our framework by providing a unified
theoretical understanding of existing mechanisms---Peer Prediction [Miller

mapping them into our framework such that theoretical results of those existing

signal processing algorithms that require complete data sets. To address the
sparse data issue, we present a new gap-fill algorithm. The proposed method
predicts each missing value separately based on data points in a
spatio-temporal neighborhood around the missing data point. The computational
workload can be distributed among several computers, making the method suitable
for large datasets. The prediction of the missing values and the estimation of
the corresponding prediction uncertainties are based on sorting procedures and
quantile regression. The algorithm was applied to MODIS NDVI data from Alaska
and tested with realistic cloud cover scenarios featuring up to 50% missing
data. Validation against established software showed that the proposed method
has a good performance in terms of the root mean squared prediction error. The
procedure is implemented and available in the open-source R package gapfill. We
demonstrate the software performance with a real data example and show how it
can be tailored to specific data. Due to the flexible software design, users
can control and redesign major parts of the procedure with little effort. This
makes it an interesting tool for gap-filling satellite data and for the future
development of gap-fill procedures.

enhanced decay rates to two photons at the LHC, within the context of the
Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In the
CP-conserving limit of the theory, such a diphoton resonance may be identified
with the heavier CP-even $H$ boson, whose gluon-fusion production and decay
into two photons are enhanced by loops of the lightest supersymmetric partner
of the top quark $\tilde{t}_1$ when its mass $m_{\tilde{t}_1}$ happens to be
near the $\tilde{t}^*_1\tilde{t}_1$ threshold, i.e.~for
$m_{\tilde{t}_1}\!\simeq \!\frac12 M_H$. The scenario requires a relatively low
supersymmetry-breaking scale $M_S\stackrel{<}{{}_\sim} 1$ TeV, but large values
of the higgsino mass parameter, $\mu \stackrel{>}{{}_\sim} 1$ TeV, that lead to
a strong $H \tilde{t}^*_1 \tilde{t}_1$ coupling. Such parameters can
accommodate the observed mass and standard-like couplings of the 125 GeV $h$
boson in the MSSM, while satisfying all other constraints from the LHC and dark
matter searches. Additional enhancement to the diphoton rate could be provided
by Coulombic QCD corrections and, to a lesser extent, by resonant contributions
due to $\tilde{t}_1^* \tilde{t}_1$ bound states. To discuss the characteristic
features of such a scenario, we consider as an illustrative example the case of
a diphoton resonance with a mass of approximately 750 GeV, for which an excess
was observed in the early LHC 13 TeV data and which later turned out to be
simply a statistical fluctuation.

probabilities for the pairs of nodes that belong to the same class or different

measures (i.e., measures resulting after taking logarithm of the proximities)
perform better while distinguishing underlying classes than the ""plain""

distances confirms this conclusion. A similar conclusion can be made for
several well-known datasets. A possible origin of this effect is that most
kernels have a multiplicative nature, while the nature of distances used in
cluster algorithms is an additive one (cf. the triangle inequality). The
logarithmic transformation is a tool to transform the first nature to the
second one. Moreover, some distances corresponding to the logarithmic measures
possess a meaningful cutpoint additivity property. In our experiments, the
leader is usually the logarithmic Communicability measure. However, we indicate
some more complicated cases in which other measures, typically, Communicability

increase in density of states around the Fermi level upon thermal annealing at
~600 oC. The result indicates that while there is an apparent band gap for GO
prior to a thermal reduction, the gap closes after an annealing around that
temperature. This trend of band gap closure was correlated with electrical,
chemical, and structural properties to determine a set of GO material
properties that is optimal for optoelectronics. The results revealed that
annealing at a temperature of ~500 oC leads to the desired properties,
demonstrated by a uniform and an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent map
of an individual GO sheet compared to as-synthesized counterpart.

biases in weak gravitational lensing data sets. These tests are important
diagnostics for currently ongoing and planned cosmic shear surveys, as such
biases induce coherent shear patterns that can mimic and potentially bias the
cosmic shear signal. The central idea of these tests is to determine the
average ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the
pixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged
ellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to
systematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the
spatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution
from cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a
position-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the
publicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence
for a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this
residual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at
those scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the
published cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS. In CFHTLenS, the amplitude of this
systematic signal is consistent with zero in fields where the number of stars
used to model the PSF is higher than average, suggesting that the
position-dependent additive shear bias originates from undersampled PSF
variations across the image.

abundances in giant H II regions. It compares observed emission lines to a grid
of photoionization models without assuming any relation between O/H and N/O.
Our grid spans a wide range in O/H, N/O and ionization parameter U, and covers
different starburst ages and nebular geometries. Varying starburst ages
accounts for variations in the ionizing radiation field hardness, which arise
due to the ageing of H II regions or the stochastic sampling of the initial
mass function. All previous approaches assume a strict relation between the
ionizing field and metallicity. The other novelty is extracting information on
the nebular physics from semi-strong emission lines. While strong lines ratios
alone ([O III]/Hbeta, [O II]/Hbeta and [N II]/Hbeta) lead to multiple O/H
solutions, the simultaneous use of [Ar III]/[Ne III] allows one to decide
whether an H II region is of high or low metallicity. Adding He I/Hbeta pins
down the hardness of the radiation field. We apply our method to H II regions
and blue compact dwarf galaxies, and find that the resulting N/O vs O/H
relation is as scattered as the one obtained from the temperature-based method.
As in previous strong-line methods calibrated on photoionization models, the
BOND O/H values are generally higher than temperature-based ones, which might
indicate the presence of temperature fluctuations or kappa distributions in
real nebulae, or a too soft ionizing radiation field in the models.

imaging using Herschel SPIRE and millimetre spectroscopy from IRAM/NOEMA, in

of rotational support to line-of-sight velocity dispersion v/sigma ~ 5 +/- 2,
and specific angular momentum lambda_R = 0.83 +/- 0.06 - comparable to field
spirals of a similar mass at this redshift. The star formation rates of 3 - 26
M_solar/yr and average 12 CO derived gas mass of 1 x 10^10 M_solar suggest gas
depletion timescales of ~ 1Gyr (~ 0.25 of the cluster crossing time). We derive
characteristic dust temperatures (mean T_dust = 26 +/- 1 K) consistent with
local galaxies of similar far-infrared luminosity, suggesting that the low
density gas is yet to be stripped. Taken together, these results suggest that
these starbursts have only recently accreted from the field, with star
formation rates likely enhanced due to the effects of ram pressure. In order to
make the transition to cluster S0s these galaxies must lose ~ 40% of their
specific angular momentum. We suggest this must occur > 1 Gyr later, after the
molecular gas has been depleted and/or stripped, via multiple tidal
interactions with other cluster members.

of members of the large population of free-floating planets (FFPs) that has
previously been inferred from measurements of the rate of short-timescale
microlensing events. Using detailed simulations of the nominal campaign
(ignoring the loss of events due to Kepler's emergency mode) and ground-based
microlensing surveys, we predict the number of events that can be detected if
there is a population of 1-Jupiter-mass FFPs matching current observational
constraints. Using a Fisher matrix analysis we also estimate the number of
detections for which it will be possible to measure the microlensing parallax,
angular Einstein radius and FFP mass. We predict that between 1.4 and 7.9
events will be detected in the K2 data, depending on the noise floor that can
be reached, but with the optimistic scenario being more likely. For nearly all
of these it will be possible to either measure the parallax or constrain it to
be probabilistically consistent with only planetary-mass lenses. We expect that
for between 0.42 and 0.98 events it will be possible to gain a complete
solution and measure the FFP mass. For the emergency mode truncated campaign,
these numbers are reduced by 20~percent. We argue that when combined with
prompt high-resolution imaging of a larger sample of short-timescale events,
K2C9 will conclusively determine if the putative FFP population is indeed both
planetary and free-floating.

constrain the viability of such WDM models using star formation histories of
the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group. We compare their high
time-resolution star formation histories (SFHs) obtained with HST-based color
magnitude diagrams with the range of possible collapse redshifts of their dark
matter halos expected in CDM and in different WDM scenarios. The collapse
redshift is inferred after determining a plausible infall mass of the subhalo.
This is based on the current mass of individual dwarf inferred from stellar
kinematics combined with results of cosmological simulations providing
information on the subhalo evolution. Since WDM subhalos close to the filtering
mass scale form significantly later than CDM, we show that they are in the
first place difficult to reconcile with a truncation of star formation
occurring as early as $z\geq 3$. The Ultra-Faint Dwarfs (UFDs) provide the most
stringent constraints. Using 6 UFDs with the best determination of the SFHs, we
show that we can exclude a 1 keV warm particle to a 2-$\sigma$ confidence
interval consistently with other methods reported in the literature. For some
objects the $2$ keV model is also excluded. We discuss the various caveats of
the method, most notably the low number of dwarfs with accurately determined
star formation histories and the uncertainties in the determination of the
infall mass of the subhalos. Our preliminary analysis serves as a pathfinder
for future investigations that will combine upcoming accurate SFHs for more
local dSphs with direct analysis of WDM cosmological simulations with baryons.

theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of
dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them
using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a
radiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly
rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation
acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale
wind speeds. Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which
extends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find
that rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of
wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the
value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat
engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting
atmospheres. Fourth, we show using GCM simulations that rotation only has a
strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our
models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b and
show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of

defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation that
are transversely confined to propagate in an infinitely long channel. Families
of single, vortex, and multi-lobed solitons are computed using a
spectrally-accurate numerical scheme. The multi-lobed solitons are unstable to
small transverse perturbations. However, the single-lobed solitons are stable
if they are sufficiently confined along the transverse direction, which
explains their effective one-dimensional dynamics. The emergence of a
transverse modulational instability is characterized in terms of a spectral
bifurcation. The critical confinement width for this bifurcation is found to
coincide with the existence of a propagating vortex solution and the onset of a
""snaking"" instability in the dark soliton dynamics that, in turn, give rise to
vortex or multi-vortex excitations. These results shed light on the
superfluidic hydrodynamics of dispersive shock waves in Bose-Einstein

case of the two-factor equation the number of symmetries is submaximal in both

  Coercion Attacks","14 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current alphanumeric and biometric authentication systems cannot withstand
situations where a user is coerced into releasing their authentication
materials under hostile circumstances. Existing approaches of coercion
resistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as
implicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the
drawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the
task in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases
where the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the
authentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.
Therefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to
achieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS
that have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect
stress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using
Chill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique
neuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for
CRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called
Dopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,
resulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the
non-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have
experimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human
subjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype
system. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to
successfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\%. Our work
not only demonstrates the potential of Chill music as a unique stimulus for
CRAS, but also paves the path of wider adoption of CRAS in general.

The random phase approximation predicts no metallic screening at long distance

might expect that graphene should be a poorly screened system. However,
empirically graphene is a weakly interacting semimetal, which leads to the
question of how electron correlations take place in graphene at different
length scales. We address this question by computing the equal time and dynamic
structure factor $S(\vec q)$ and $S(\vec q, \omega)$ of freestanding graphene
using {\it ab-initio} fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo and the random phase
approximation. We find that the $\sigma$ electrons contribute strongly to
$S(\vec q,\omega)$ for relevant experimental values of $\omega$ even at
distances up to around 80 \AA. These findings illustrate how the emergent
physics from underlying Coulomb interactions results in the observed weakly
correlated semimetal.

for planktonic cells in well-agitated liquid culture, in which all cells have
equal access to nutrients. In the real world, bacteria are more likely to live
in physically structured habitats as colonies, within which individual cells
vary in their access to nutrients. The dynamics of bacterial growth in such
conditions is poorly understood, and, unlike that for liquid culture, there is
not a standard broadly used mathematical model for bacterial populations
growing in colonies in three dimensions (3-d). By extending the classic Monod
model of resource-limited population growth to allow for spatial heterogeneity
in the bacterial access to nutrients, we develop a 3-d model of colonies, in
which bacteria consume diffusing nutrients in their vicinity. By following the
changes in density of E.coli in liquid and embedded in glucose-limited soft
agar, we evaluate the fit of this model to experimental data. The model
accounts for the experimentally observed presence of a sub-exponential,
diffusion-limited growth regime in colonies, which is absent in liquid
cultures. The model predicts and our experiments confirm that, as a consequence
of inter-colony competition for the diffusing nutrients and of cell death,
there is a non-monotonic relationship between total number of colonies within
the habitat and the total number of individual cells in all of these colonies.
This combined theoretical-experimental study reveals that, within 3-d colonies,
E.coli cells are loosely packed, and colonies produce about 2.5 times as many
cells as the liquid culture from the same amount of nutrients. Our model
provides a baseline description of bacterial growth in 3-d, deviations from
which can be used to identify phenotypic heterogeneities and inter-cellular
interactions that further contribute to the structure of bacterial communities.

cosmological parameters, and future surveys will be able to constrain the dark
energy equation of state $w$. When analyzing galaxy surveys, redshift
information has proven to be a valuable addition to angular shear correlations.
We forecast parameter constraints on the triplet $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$ for an
LSST-like photometric galaxy survey, using tomography of the shear-shear power
spectrum, convergence peak counts and higher convergence moments. We find that
redshift tomography with the power spectrum reduces the area of the $1\sigma$
confidence interval in $(\Omega_m,w)$ space by a factor of 8 with respect to
the case of the single highest redshift bin. We also find that adding
non-Gaussian information from the peak counts and higher-order moments of the
convergence field and its spatial derivatives further reduces the constrained
area in $(\Omega_m,w)$ by a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. When we add cosmic
microwave background parameter priors from Planck to our analysis, tomography
improves power spectrum constraints by a factor of 3. Adding moments yields an
improvement by an additional factor of 2, and adding both moments and peaks

research has been traditionally based on low level features such as contrast,

WEPSAM : Weakly Pre-Learnt Saliency Model as a pioneering effort of using
domain specific pre-learing on ImageNet for saliency prediction using a light
weight CNN architecture. The paper proposes a two step hierarchical learning,
in which the first step is to develop a framework for weakly pre-training on a
large scale dataset such as ImageNet which is void of human eye fixation maps.
The second step refines the pre-trained model on a limited set of ground truth
fixations. Analysis of loss on iSUN and SALICON datasets reveal that
pre-trained network converges much faster compared to randomly initialized
network. WEPSAM also outperforms some recent state-of-the-art saliency

interactions between individuals. However, even if they could provide an
explanation for the emergence and stability of cooperation in modern societies,
they are not able to reproduce some key features observed in social and
economical interactions. The typical shape of wealth distribution - known as
Pareto Law - and the microscopic organization of wealth production are two of
them. Here, we introduce a modification to the classical formulation of Public
Goods Games that allows for the emergence of both of these features from first
principles. Unlike traditional Public Goods Games on networks, where players
contribute equally to all the games in which they participate, we allow
individuals to redistribute their contribution according to what they earned in
previous rounds. Results from numerical simulations show that not only a Pareto
distribution for the payoffs naturally emerges but also that if players don't
invest enough in one round they can act as defectors even if they are formally
cooperators. Finally, we also show that the players self-organize in a very
productive backbone that covers almost perfectly the minimum spanning tree of
the underlying interaction network. Our results not only give an explanation
for the presence of the wealth heterogeneity observed in real data but also
points to a conceptual change regarding how cooperation is defined in
collective dilemmas.

gravitational-wave observatories to look for macroscopic (kilogram-scale or
larger) objects. Keeping the size of the dark matter objects to be smaller than
the physical dimensions of the detectors, and keeping their mass as free
parameters, we derive the expected event rates. For favorable choice of mass,
we find that dark matter interactions could be detected in space-based
detectors such as LISA at a rate of one per ten years. We then assume the
existence of an additional Yukawa force between dark matter and regular matter.
By choosing the range of the force to be comparable to the size of the
detectors, we derive the levels of sensitivity to such a new force, which
exceeds the sensitivity of other probes in a wide range of parameters. For
sufficiently large Yukawa coupling strength, the rate of dark matter events can
then exceed 10 per year for both ground- and space-based detectors. Thus,
gravitational-wave observatories can make an important contribution to a global
effort of searching for non-gravitational interactions of dark matter.

complexes in the Milky Way is investigated. We compare their masses $M_{\rm

dispersions $\sigma$, star formation rates $SFR$, and SFR densities
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ with those of structures ranging from cores, clumps, Giant
Molecular Clouds (GMCs), to Molecular Cloud Complexes (MCCs), and to Galaxies,
spanning 8 orders of magnitudes in size and 13 orders of magnitudes in mass.
MCC are mostly large ($R>50$ pc), massive ($\sim 10^{6}$\,\msun)
gravitationally unbound cloud structures. This results in the following
universal relations:
  $\sigma\sim R^{0.5}$, $M_{\rm gas}\sim R^{2}$, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim
\Sigma_{M_{\rm gas}}^{1.5}$, ${SFR}\sim {M_{\rm gas}}^{0.9}$, and ${SFR}\sim
{\sigma}^{2.7}$.
  Variations in the slopes and the coefficients of these relations are found at
individual scales signifying different physics acting at different scales.
Additionally, there are breaks at the MCC scale in the $\sigma-R$ relation and
between the starburst and the normal star-forming objects in the $SFR-M_{\rm
gas}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-$\Sigma_{\rm M_{\rm gas}}$ relations. We propose
to use the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram to distinguish the starburst from the
normal star-forming structures by applying a $\Sigma_{M_{\rm gas}}$ threshold
of $\sim100$\,\msun pc$^{-2}$ and a $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ threshold of 1\,\msun
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Mini-starburst complexes have enhanced $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$
($>$1\,\msun yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$), probably caused by dynamic events such as
radiation pressure, colliding flows, or spiral arm gravitational instability.
Because of the dynamical evolution, gravitational boundedness does not play a
significant role in characterizing the star formation activity of MCCs,
especially the mini-starburst complexes.

erasure protection when the system is partially constrained to have local

offload mobile data traffic from macrocells. While cellular users' mobility
behaviors are taken into consideration, a dilemma is formed: Should a User
Equipment (UE) either handover into a femtocell or keep the current connection
with a macrocell? Indeed, various user mobility behaviors may incur significant
signaling overhead and degrade femtocell offloading capability due to frequent
handover in/out femtocells. To address this dilemma, in this paper we propose
an Optimal Threshold Offloading (OTO) algorithm considering the tradeoff
between the signaling overhead and femtocell offloading capability. We develop
an analytical model and define two performance metrics to quantify the
tradeoff. The proposed model not only models user mobility behaviors but also
captures femtocell offloading benefits, and shed light on their fundamental
relationship. The correctness of analytical model and simulation model are
cross-validated by extensive ns2 simulations. Both analytical and simulation
results demonstrate that the OTO algorithm can significantly reduce signaling
overhead at the minor cost of femtocell offloading capability. The results
enable wide applicability in various scenarios, and therefore, have important
theoretical significance. Moreover, the analytical results provide a quick way
to evaluate signaling overhead and offloading capability in LTE networks

new physics (NP) sector is odd under an exact global $Z_2$ symmetry. This
symmetry guaranties that the lightest NP neutral particle is stable, providing
a natural dark matter (DM) candidate, and leads to naturally suppressed
neutrino masses generated by a one-loop realization of an effective Weinberg
operator. We focus on the region with the highest sensitivity in present and
future LHC searches, with light scalar DM and at least one NP fermion triplet
at the sub-TeV scale. This region allows for significant production
cross-sections of NP fermion pairs at the LHC. We reinterpret a set of searches
for supersymmetric particles at the LHC obtained using the package CheckMATE,
to set limits on our model as a function of the masses of the NP particles and
their Yukawa interactions. The most sensitive search channel is found to be
dileptons plus missing transverse energy. In order to target the case of tau
enhanced decays and the case of compressed spectra we reinterpret the recent
slepton and chargino search bounds by ATLAS. For a lightest NP fermion triplet
with a maximal branching ratio to either electrons or muons we exclude NP
fermion masses of up to 650 GeV, while this bound is reduced to approximately
400 GeV in the tau-philic case. Allowing for a general flavor structure we set

Assembly (AIA) on board \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} disclose that the
CME first appears as a bubble-like structure. Subsequently, its expansion forms
the CME and causes a quasi-circular EUV wave. Interestingly, both the CME and
the wave front are clearly visible at all of the AIA EUV passbands. Through a
detailed kinematical analysis, it is found that the expansion of the CME
undergoes two phases: a first phase with a strong but transient lateral
over-expansion followed by a second phase with a self-similar expansion. The
temporal evolution of the expansion velocity coincides very well with the
variation of the 25--50 keV hard X-ray flux of the associated flare, which
indicates that magnetic reconnection most likely plays an important role in
driving the expansion. Moreover, we find that, when the velocity of the CME
reaches $\sim$600 km s$^{-1}$, the EUV wave starts to evolve into a shock wave,
which is evidenced by the appearance of a type II radio burst. The shock's
formation height is estimated to be $\sim$0.2$R_{sun}$, which is much lower
than the height derived previously. Finally, we also study the thermal
properties of the CME and the EUV wave. We find that the plasma in the CME
leading front and the wave front has a temperature of $\sim$2 MK, while that in
the CME core region and the flare region has a much higher temperature of
$\ge$8 MK.

this base, first, a canonical quantization scheme is presented for the
electromagnetic field interacting with atomic systems in an anisotropic,
inhomogeneous and absorbing magnetodielectric medium which can suitably be used
for studying the influence of arbitrary invisibility cloak on the atomic
radiative properties. The time dependence of the atomic subsystem is obtained
in the Schrodinger picture. By introducing a modified set of the spherical wave
vector functions, the Green tensor of the system is calculated via the
continuous and discrete methods. In this formalism, the decay rate and as well
the emission pattern of the aforementioned atom are computed analytically for
both weak and strong coupling interaction, and then numerically calculations
are done to demonstrate the performances of cloaking in the quantum mechanics

locations of atomic system near the spherical invisibility cloaking. Results in

To appear in ApJ",,"10.3847/0004-637X/826/2/215",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is evidence in 21cm HI emission for voids several kpc in size centered
approximately on the Galactic centre, both above and below the Galactic plane.
These appear to map the boundaries of the Galactic nuclear wind. An analysis of
HI at the tangent points, where the distance to the gas can be estimated with
reasonable accuracy, shows a sharp transition at Galactic radii $R\lesssim 2.4$
kpc from the extended neutral gas layer characteristic of much of the Galactic
disk, to a thin Gaussian layer with FWHM $\sim 125$ pc. An anti-correlation
between HI and $\gamma$-ray emission at latitudes $10^{\circ} \leq |b| \leq
20^{\circ}$ suggests that the boundary of the extended HI layer marks the walls
of the Fermi Bubbles. With HI we are able to trace the edges of the voids from
$|z| > 2$ kpc down to $z\approx0$, where they have a radius $\sim 2$ kpc. The
extended HI layer likely results from star formation in the disk, which is
limited largely to $R \gtrsim 3$ kpc, so the wind may be expanding into an area
of relatively little HI. Because the HI kinematics can discriminate between gas
in the Galactic center and foreground material, 21cm HI emission may be the
best probe of the extent of the nuclear wind near the Galactic plane.

there is an additional magnetic anomaly around 20 K, as though the N\'eel order

spin-fluctuations from the Ru 4d band needs to be revisited. Additionally, in
the vicinity of TN, AC \c{hi} shows a prominent frequency dependence and, below
TN, MIRM exhibits a slow decay with time. This raises a question whether the
antiferromagnetic structure in this compound is characterized by
spin-glass-like dynamics. In contrast to what was reported earlier, there is a
change in the sign of the magnetoresistance (MR) at the metamagnetic
transition. A butter-fly-shaped (isothermal) MR loop (interestingly spanning
over all the four quadrants) is observed at 2 K with distinct evidence for the
magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in zero field after travelling through
metamagnetic transition field. The results on polycrystals thus provide

both SES area and surface charge as well as several physical and geometrical

The relevance to protein-solvent interaction of these physical and geometrical

universal existence of negative surface charge and dipole, the characteristic

parameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson
($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling
between the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative
U(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak
symmetry. In this model context, we first investigate the electroweak vacuum

the two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the
top quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform

changes but also these changes are closely related, both spatially and
temporally. The magnitudes of the correlation coefficients between the temporal
variations of horizontal magnetic field and sunspot intensity are all larger

using four active regions in quiescent times, three observed and one simulated,
we show that in sunspot penumbra regions there also exists a close correlation
between sunspot intensity and horizontal magnetic field strength, in addition
to the well-known one between sunspot intensity and normal magnetic field
strength. Connecting these two observational phenomena, we show that the
sunspot structure change and the magnetic field change are the two facets of
the same phenomena of solar flares, one change might be induced by the change
of the other due to a linear correlation between sunspot intensity and magnetic

Since the probabilistic CGF is minimized in terms of the R\'enyi entropy of the
source, one of the motivations of this study is to derive an
individual-sequence analogue of the R\'enyi entropy, in the same way that the
FS compressibility is the individual-sequence counterpart of the Shannon
entropy. We consider the CGF of the code-length both from the perspective of
fixed-to-variable (F-V) length coding and the perspective of
variable-to-variable (V-V) length coding, where the latter turns out to yield a
better result, that coincides with the FS compressibility. We also extend our
results to compression with side information, available at both the encoder and

is the magnetic field organized forming vertical, helical structures or is it
dominantly horizontal? And concerning their dynamics, are tornadoes really
rotating or is it just a visual illusion? Here, we analyze four consecutive
spectropolarimetric scans of a prominence hosting tornadoes on its legs which
help us shed some light on their magnetic and dynamical properties. We show
that the magnetic field is very smooth in all the prominence, probably an
intrinsic property of the coronal field. The prominence legs have vertical
helical fields that show slow temporal variation probably related to the motion
of the fibrils. Concerning the dynamics, we argue that 1) if rotation exists,
it is intermittent, lasting no more than one hour, and 2) the observed velocity

where two pairs of users exchange information with the help of a common relay.
Each user $i$ is equipped with $M_i$ antennas, for $i=1,2,3,4$, and the relay
is equipped with $N$ antennas. First, we derive an outer bound of the DoF
region by using the cut-set theorem and the genie-message approach. Then, we
propose a new transmission scheme to achieve the outer bound of the DoF region.
Due to the asymmetric data exchange, where the two users in each pair can
communicate a different number of data streams, we not only need to form the
network-coded symbols but also need to process the additional asymmetric data
streams at the relay. This is realized through the joint design of relay
compression matrix and source precoding matrices. After obtaining the optimal
DoF region, we study the optimal sum DoF by solving a linear programming
problem. From the optimal DoF region of this channel, we show that in the
asymmetric antenna setting, some antennas at certain source nodes are redundant
and cannot contribute to enlarge the DoF region. We also show that there is no
loss of optimality in terms of the sum DoF by enforcing symmetric data
exchange, where the two users in each pair are restricted to communicate the
same number of data streams.

problems. The proposed methods use an approach from non-parametric statistics
called bootstrapping to create confidence bounds. This is achieved without
making any assumptions about the distribution of noise in the underlying
system. We present the X-Random and X-Fixed bootstrap bandits which correspond
to the two well-known approaches for conducting bootstraps on models, in the
literature. The proposed methods are compared to other popular solutions for
linear stochastic bandit problems, namely, OFUL, LinUCB and Thompson Sampling.
The comparisons are carried out using a simulation study on a hierarchical
probability meta-model, built from published data of experiments, which are run
on real systems. The model representing the response surfaces is conceptualized
as a Bayesian Network which is presented with varying degrees of noise for the
simulations. One of the proposed methods, X-Random bootstrap, performs better
than the baselines in-terms of cumulative regret across various degrees of
noise and different number of trials. In certain settings the cumulative regret
of this method is less than half of the best baseline. The X-Fixed bootstrap
performs comparably in most situations and particularly well when the number of
trials is low. The study concludes that these algorithms could be a preferred
alternative for solving linear bandit problems, especially when the
distribution of the noise in the system is unknown.

difficult to extract from any direct experimental characterization. Usually,
coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) models are constructed simply by aligning two
symmetric planes, ignoring various possible reconstructions. Here, we propose a
general self-passivation rule to determine the low-energy GB reconstruction,
and find new configurations for the CdTe sigma3 (112) GBs. First-principles
calculations show that it has lower formation energies than the prototype GBs
adopted widely in previous studies. Surprisingly, the reconstructed GBs show
self-passivated electronic properties without deep-level states in the band
gap. Based on the reconstructed configurations, we revisited the influence of
CdCl2 post-treatment on the CdTe GBs, and found that the addition of both Cd
and Cl atoms in the GB improves the photovoltaic properties by promoting
self-passivation and inducing n-type levels, respectively. The present study
provides a new route for further studies of GBs in covalent polycrystalline
semiconductors and also highlights that previous studies on the GBs of
multinary semiconductors which are based on the unreconstructed prototype GB
models, should be revisited.

here the steps we undertook to this end: firstly, we developed two ad hoc

language independent and can be used for generation of labeled documents
datasets (both scanned and cameracaptured) in any cursive and non-cursive
language, e.g., English, Russian, Arabic, Urdu, etc. To assess the
effectiveness of the presented method, two different datasets in English and
Russian are generated using the presented method. Evaluation of samples from
the two datasets shows that 99:98% of the images were correctly labeled. The
second contribution is a large dataset (called C3Wi) of camera-captured
characters and words images, comprising 1 million word images (10 million
character images), captured in a real camera-based acquisition. This dataset
can be used for training as well as testing of character recognition systems on
camera-captured documents. The third contribution is a novel method for the
recognition of cameracaptured document images. The proposed method is based on
Long Short-Term Memory and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for camera
based OCRs. As a fourth contribution, various benchmark tests are performed to
uncover the behavior of commercial (ABBYY), open source (Tesseract), and the
presented camera-based OCR using the presented C3Wi dataset. Evaluation results
reveal that the existing OCRs, which already get very high accuracies on
scanned documents, have limited performance on camera-captured document images;
where ABBYY has an accuracy of 75%, Tesseract an accuracy of 50.22%, while the

associate the Hankel determinants $D_{n} = \det \mathcal{H}_{n}$ of the Hankel
matrices $\mathcal{H}_{n}:= (s_{i + j})_{i, j = 0}^{n}$, $n \geq 0$, and the
nonempty set $N_{s}:= \{n \geq 1 \, | \, D_{n-1} \neq 0 \}$. We also define the
Hankel determinant polynomials $P_0:=1$, and $P_n$, $n\geq 1$ as the
determinant of the Hankel matrix $\mathcal H_n$ modified by replacing the last
row by the monomials $1, x, \ldots, x^n$. Clearly $P_n$ is a polynomial of
degree at most $n$ and of degree $n$ if and only if $n\in N_s $. Kronecker
established in 1881 that if $N_s $ is finite then rank $\mathcal{H}_{n} = r$
for each $n \geq r-1$, where $r := \max N_s $. By using an approach suggested
by I.S.Iohvidov in 1969 we give a short proof of this result and a transparent
proof of the conditions on a real sequence $\{t_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ to be of the
form $t_n=D_n$, $n\geq 0$ for a real sequence $\{s_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. This is the
Hankel determinant problem. We derive from the Kronecker identities that each
Hankel determinant polynomial $ P_n $ satisfying deg$P_n = n\geq 1$ is preceded
by a nonzero polynomial $P_{n-1}$ whose degree can be strictly less than $n-1$
and which has no common zeros with $ P_n $. As an application of our results we
obtain a new proof of a recent theorem by Berg and Szwarc about positive
semidefiniteness of all Hankel matrices provided that $D_0 > 0, \ldots, D_{r-1}
> 0 $ and $D_n=0$ for all $n\geq r$.

investigating the optical properties of vertical cavities including
subwavelength gratings. Three different techniques for determining the
resonance frequency and Q-factor of a cavity mode are compared. Based on that,
the Fabry-Perot approach has been chosen due to its numerical efficiency. The
computational uncertainty in determining the resonance frequency and Q-factor
is investigated, showing that the uncertainty in the Q-factor calculation can
be a few orders of magnitude larger than that in the resonance frequency
calculation. Moreover, a method for reducing 3D simulations to
lower-dimensional simulations is suggested, and is shown to enable approximate
and fast simulations of certain device parameters. Numerical calculation of the
cavity dispersion, which is an important characteristic of vertical cavities,
is illustrated. By employing the implemented FMM, it is shown that adiabatic
heterostructures designs are advantageous compared to abrupt heterostructures
for minimizing the cavity scattering loss.

classified as ionized jets (12 of which are candidates), 2 as ambiguous jets or
disc winds, 1 as a disc-wind, 14 as HII regions and 2 were unable to be
categorised. Classification as ionized jets is based upon morphology, radio
flux and spectral index, in conjunction with previous observational results at
other wavelengths. Radio-luminosity and momentum are found to scale with
bolometric luminosity in the same way as low-mass jets, indicating a common
mechanism for jet production across all masses. In 13 of the jets, we see
associated non-thermal/optically-thin lobes resulting from shocks either
internal to the jet and/or at working surfaces. Ten jets display non-thermal
(synchrotron emission) spectra in their lobes, with an average spectral index
of -0.55 consistent with Fermi acceleration in shocks. This shows that magnetic
fields are present, in agreement with models of jet formation incorporating
magnetic fields. Since the production of collimated radio jets is associated
with accretion processes, the results presented in this paper support the
picture of disc-mediated accretion for the formation of massive stars with an
upper-limit on the jet phase lasting approximately $6.5 \times 10^4 yr$.
Typical mass loss rates in the jet are found to be $1.4 \times 10^{-5} M_\odot

scales behave simultaneously as the inflation scale. This setup not only
realizes the previously-achieved consequences of inflation and leptogenesis,
but also provides new insights in superheavy dark matter and neutrino masses.
We argue that the 3-3-1-1 model can incorporate a scalar sextet, which induces
both small masses for the neutrinos via a combined type I and II seesaw and
large masses for the new neutral fermions. Additionally, all the new particles
have the large masses in the inflation scale. The lightest particle among the
W-particles that have abnormal (i.e., wrong) B-L number in comparison to those
of the standard model particles may be a superheavy dark matter as it is
stabilized by the W-parity. The dark matter candidate may be a Majorana
fermion, a neutral scalar, or a neutral gauge boson, which was properly created
in the early universe due to the gravitational effects on the vacuum or the
thermal production after cosmic inflation.

with specific sequence preferences. However, different TFs can partially share
their binding sequences due to their common evolutionary origin. This
`redundancy' of binding defines a way of organizing TFs in `motif families' by
grouping TFs with similar binding preferences. Since these ultimately define
the TF target genes, the motif family organization entails information about
the structure of transcriptional regulation as it has been shaped by evolution.
Focusing on the human TF repertoire, we show that a one-parameter evolutionary
model of the Birth-Death-Innovation type can explain the TF empirical
ripartition in motif families, and allows to highlight the relevant
evolutionary forces at the origin of this organization. Moreover, the model
allows to pinpoint few deviations from the neutral scenario it assumes: three
over-expanded families (including HOX and FOX genes), a set of `singleton' TFs
for which duplication seems to be selected against, and a higher-than-average
rate of diversification of the binding preferences of TFs with a Zinc Finger
DNA binding domain. Finally, a comparison of the TF motif family organization
in different eukaryotic species suggests an increase of redundancy of binding

non-monotonic flow curves occur which lead to the formation of persistent

with normally distributed noise, and it has been successfully applied in
numerous application areas. It provides sequentially calculated estimates of
the system states along with a corresponding covariance matrix. For nonlinear
systems, the extended Kalman filter is often used which is derived from the
Kalman filter by linearization around the current estimate. A key issue in
metrology is the evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the Kalman
filter state estimates. The ""Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
Measurements"" (GUM) and its supplements serve as the de facto standard for
uncertainty evaluation in metrology. We explore the relationship between the
covariance matrix produced by the Kalman filter and a GUM-compliant uncertainty
analysis. In addition, also the results of a Bayesian analysis are considered.
For the case of linear systems with known system matrices, we show that all
three approaches are compatible. When the system matrices are not precisely
known, however, or when the system is nonlinear, this equivalence breaks down
and different results can be reached then. Though for precisely known nonlinear
systems the result of the extended Kalman filter still corresponds to the
linearized uncertainty propagation of GUM. The extended Kalman filter can
suffer from linearization and convergence errors. These disadvantages can be
avoided to some extent by applying Monte Carlo procedures, and we propose such
a method which is GUM-compliant and can also be applied online during the
estimation. We illustrate all procedures in terms of a two-dimensional dynamic
system and compare the results with those obtained by particle filtering, which
has been proposed for the approximate calculation of a Bayesian solution.
Finally, we give some recommendations based on our findings.

ingredients have a fundamental role for computational efficiency, the major
conceptual change of paradigm with respect to the standard implementation is
the idea of using weighted quadrature: the test function is incorporated in the
integration weight while the trial function, the geometry parametrization and
the PDEs coefficients form the integrand function. This approach is very
effective in reducing the computational cost, while maintaining the optimal
order of approximation of the method. Analysis of the cost is confirmed by
numerical testing, where we show that, for $p$ large enough, the time required
by the floating point operations is less than the time spent in unavoidable

Observatory (CSO) observations of the prestellar core in L1689N, which has been
suggested to be interacting with a molecular outflow driven by the nearby solar
type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. This source is characterized by some of the
highest deuteration levels seen in the interstellar medium. The change in the
NH2D line velocity and width across the core provides clear evidence of an
interaction with the outflow, traced by the high-velocity water emission.
Quiescent, cold gas, characterized by narrow line widths is seen in the NE part
of the core, while broader, more disturbed line profiles are seen in the W/SW
part. Strong N2D+ and ND3 emission is detected with the ACA, extending S/SW
from the peak of the single-dish NH2D emission. The ACA data also reveal the
presence a compact dust continuum source, with a mean size of ~1100 au, a
central density of (1-2) 10^7 cm-3, and a mass of 0.2-0.4 Msun. The dust
emission peak is displaced ~5"" to the south with respect to the N2D+ and ND3
emission, as well as the single-dish dust continuum peak, suggesting that the
northern, quiescent part of the core is characterized by spatially extended
continuum emission, which is resolved out by the interferometer. We see no
clear evidence of fragmentation in this quiescent part of the core, which could
lead to a second generation of star formation, although a weak dust continuum
source is detected in this region in the ACA data.

the Schr{\""o}dinger propagator to L 2 -- L 2 microlocalized (in space and in
frequency) dispersion inequalities for the wave operator. This paper aims to
contribute in enlightening our comprehension of how dispersion for waves imply
dispersion for the Schr{\""o}dinger equation. More precisely, the hypothesis of
our main theorem encodes dispersion for the wave equation in an uniform way,
with respect to the light cone. In many situations the phenomena that arise
near the boundary of the light cone are the more complicated ones. The method
we present allows to forget those phenomena we do not understand very well yet.
The second main step shows the Strichartz estimates with loss of derivatives we
can obtain under those assumptions. The setting we work with is general enough
to recover a large variety of frameworks (infinite metric spaces, Riemannian
manifolds with rough metric, some groups, ...) where the lack of knowledge of
the wave propagator is a restraint to our understanding of the dispersion
phenomenon.

spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with V-band equivalent magnitudes
brighter than -10 mag for faint extended structures. Our data reveal peculiar
compact stellar systems, which appear asymmetric or elongated from their outer
light distribution. We characterize the structure of our objects by quantifying
their core concentration, as well as their outer asymmetry and ellipticity. For
the brighter objects of our sample we also investigate their spatial and
phase-space distribution within the cluster. We argue that the distorted outer
structure alone that is seen for some of our objects, is not sufficient to
decide whether these systems have a star cluster or a galaxy origin. However,
we find that objects with low core concentration and high asymmetry (or high
ellipticity) are primarily located at larger cluster-centric distances as
compared to the entire sample. This supports the hypothesis that at least some
of these objects may originate from tidally stripped galaxies.

non-increasing attenuation function $l:(0,\infty) \to (0,\infty)$ to create the
random field $\Psi(y)=\sum_{x\in \eta}l(|x-y|),$ where $\eta$ is a homogeneous
Poisson process in ${\mathbb R}^d.$ The field $\Psi$ is then a random potential
field with infinite range dependencies whenever the support of the function $l$
is unbounded.
  In particular, we study the level sets $\Psi_{\geq h}(y)$ containing the
points $y\in {\mathbb R}^d$ such that $\Psi(y)\geq h.$ In the case where $l$
has unbounded support, we give, for any $d\geq 2,$ exact conditions on $l$ for
$\Psi_{\geq h}(y)$ to have a percolative phase transition as a function of $h.$
  We also prove that when $l$ is continuous then so is $\Psi$ almost surely.
Moreover, in this case and for $d=2,$ we prove uniqueness of the infinite
component of $\Psi_{\geq h}$ when such exists, and we also show that the
so-called percolation function is continuous below the critical value $h_c$.

Bayesian methodology, we model the full posterior distribution of possible

the complexity of the state representation used by the expert, and to learn

biological processes. The reaction-radius at which the reactant and target may
interact is often a small parameter relative to the diameter of the domain in
which the reactant diffuses. We develop uniform in time asymptotic expansions
in the reaction-radius of the full solution to the corresponding diffusion
equations for two separate reactant-target interaction mechanisms: the Doi or
volume reactivity model, and the Smoluchowski-Collins-Kimball partial
absorption surface reactivity model. In the former, the reactant and target
react with a fixed probability per unit time when within a specified
separation. In the latter, upon reaching a fixed separation, they
probabilistically react or the reactant reflects away from the target.
Expansions of the solution to each model are constructed by projecting out the
contribution of the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction to the solution of the
diffusion equation, and then developing matched asymptotic expansions in
Laplace-transform space. Our approach offers an equivalent, but alternative,
method to the pseudo-potential approach we previously employed in [Isaacson and
Newby 2013] for the simpler Smoluchowski pure absorption reaction mechanism. We
find that the resulting asymptotic expansions of the diffusion equation
solutions are identical with the exception of one parameter: the diffusion
limited reaction rates of the Doi and partial absorption models. This
demonstrates that for biological systems in which the reaction-radius is a
small parameter, properly calibrated Doi and partial absorption models may be
functionally equivalent.

quantization of Lie bialgebras by giving their complete classification up to
homotopy equivalence. An important new technical ingredient introduced in this
paper is an endofunctor D in the category of augmented props with the property
that for any representation of a prop P in a vector space V the associated prop
DP admits an induced representation on the graded commutative tensor algebra
S(V) given in terms of polydifferential operators. Applying this functor to the
prop LieB of Lie bialgebras we show that universal formality maps for
quantizations of Lie bialgebras are in in 1-1 correspondence with prop
morphisms from the minimal resolution AssB_infty of the prop of associative
bialgebras to the polydifferential prop DLieB_infty satisfying certain boundary
conditions. We prove that the set of such formality morphisms (having an extra
property of being Lie connected) is non-empty. The latter result is used in
turn to give a short proof of the formality theorem for universal quantizations
of arbitrary Lie bialgebras which says that for any Drinfeld associator there
is an associated Lie_infty quasi-isomorphism between the Lie_infty algebras
controlling, respectively, deformations of the standard bialgebra structure in
S(V) and deformations of any given Lie bialgebra structure in V.
  We study the deformation complex of an arbitrary universal formality morphism
and show that it is quasi-isomorphic (up to one class corresponding to the
standard rescaling automorphism of the properad LieB) to the full oriented
graph complex studied earlier in \cite{Wi2}. This result gives a complete
classification of the set of gauge equivalence classes of universal Lie
connected formality maps --- it is a torsor over the Grothendieck-Teichm\""uller
group GRT and can hence can be identified with the set of Drinfeld associators.

expands at a speed of $\sim 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ and has a mass of $\sim 220$

relative to $^{12}$CO J=1-0 emission and possible line broadenings (in velocity
range $-64$ to $-60$ km s$^{-1}$) are found at the northeastern boundary of the
SNR, where the shell is deformed and decelerated. These features, combined with
the morphological correspondence between the expanding molecular bubble and
Tycho, suggest that the SNR is associated with the bubble at the velocity range
$-66$ to $-57$ km s$^{-1}$. The most plausible origin for the expanding bubble
is the fast outflow (with velocity of hundreds km s$^{-1}$) driven from the
vicinity of a WD as it accreted matter from a nondegenerate companion star. The
SNR has been expanding in the low-density wind-blown bubble, and the shock wave
has just reached the molecular cavity wall. The SNR has been expanding in the

nm. According to the ratio of the single photon spectral bandwidth to the joint
spectral bandwidth of the photon pairs, the degree of frequency entanglement is
quantified to be 6.19. Based on a Hong Ou Mandel interferometric coincidence
measurement, a frequency indistinguishability of 95 % is demonstrated. The good

is to boost the confidence of recent in-expectation $O(d/n)$ excess risk bounds
for empirical risk minimization (ERM), without sacrificing the rate, by
leveraging a Bernstein condition which holds due to exp-concavity. We also show
that with probability $1 - \delta$ the standard ERM method obtains excess risk
$O(d (\log(n) + \log(1/\delta))/n)$. We further show that a regret bound for
any online learner in this setting translates to a high probability excess risk
bound for the corresponding online-to-batch conversion of the online learner.
Lastly, we present two high probability bounds for the exp-concave model
selection aggregation problem that are quantile-adaptive in a certain sense.
The first bound is a purely exponential weights type algorithm, obtains a
nearly optimal rate, and has no explicit dependence on the Lipschitz continuity
of the loss. The second bound requires Lipschitz continuity but obtains the
optimal rate.

the B clone. We also derive, analytically and numerically, via population

investigating the nature of the ejecta from the central engine. If the ejecta
magnetization is not high enough to suppress the RS, a strong RS emission
component, usually peaking in the optical/IR band early on, would give
important contribution to early afterglow light curves. In the radio band,
synchrotron self-absorption may suppress early RS emission, and also delay the
RS peak time. In this paper, we calculate the self-absorbed RS emission in the
radio band for different dynamical conditions. In particular, we stress that
the RS radio emission is subject to self-absorption in both reverse and forward
shocks. We calculate the ratio between the reverse to forward shock flux at the
RS peak time for different frequencies, which is a measure of the detectability
of the RS emission component. We then constrain the range of physical
parameters for a detectable RS, in particular the role of magnetization. We
notice that unlike optical RS emission which is enhanced by moderate
magnetization, a moderately magnetized ejecta does not necessarily produce a
brighter radio RS due to the self-absorption effect. For typical parameters,
the RS emission component would not be detectable below 1 GHz unless the medium
density is very low (e.g. $n < 10^{-3} ~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ for ISM and $A_* <
5\times 10^{-4}$ for wind). These predictions can be tested with the afterglow
observations with current and upcoming radio facilities such as JVLA, LOFAR,

of resources partially based on the history of latencies. Response time was
considered as a metric for evaluation of proposed method. Results indicated the
better response time, especially by increasing the number of tasks. Besides,
the proposed method is inherently capable for detecting the unavailable

understand the physics at work in gamma-ray bursts. This can only be done for
GRBs with known redshift. Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical
spectrum of the afterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions
may introduce biases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt
emission. Our analysis is based on a sample of 90 GRBs with good optical
follow-up and well measured prompt emission. 76 of them have a measure of
redshift and 14 have no redshift. We estimate their optical brightness with
their R magnitude measured two hours after the trigger and compare the rest
frame prompt properties of different classes of GRB afterglow brightness. We
find that the optical brightness of GRBs in our sample is mainly driven by
their intrinsic afterglow luminosity. We show that GRBs with low and high
afterglow optical fluxes have similar Epi , Eiso , Liso , indicating that the
rest-frame distributions computed from GRBs with a redshift are not
significantly distorted by optical selection effects. However we found that the
rest frame T90 distribution is not immune to optical selection effect, which
favor the selection of GRBs with longer durations. Finally, we note that GRBs
in the upper part of the Epi-Eiso plane have fainter optical afterglows and we
show that optical selection effects strongly favor the detection of GRBs with
bright afterglows located close or below the best-fit Epi-Eiso relation, whose

line-of-sight turbulent magnetic field to the line-of-sight mean magnetic field
to depict the level of turbulence. When this ratio is either large
($\eta\gg1$), which characterizes a turbulent field dominated region, or small
($\eta\lesssim0.2$), which characterizes a mean field dominated region, we
obtain the polarization variance $\left<P^2\right>\propto\lambda^{-2}$ and
$\left<P^2\right>\propto\lambda^{-2-2m}$, respectively. At small $\eta$, i.e.,
the mean field dominated region, we successfully recover the turbulent spectral
index by the polarization variance. We find that our simulations agree well
with the theoretical prediction of Lazarian \& Pogosyan. With existing and
upcoming data cubes from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio astronomy (LOFAR)
and Square Kilometer Array (SKA), this new technique can be applied to study
the magnetic turbulence in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

laboratory studies of fire whirls initiated as pool fires, but where the fuel

to a fire whirl, and then to a previously unobserved state, a blue whirl. A
blue whirl is smaller, very stable, and burns completely blue-violet in a
hydrocarbon flame, indicating soot-free burning. The combination of fast mixing
and the water-surface boundary creates the conditions leading to nearly
soot-free combustion. With the worldwide need to reduce emissions from both
wanted and unwanted combustion, discovery of this new state points to new
pathways for highly efficient and low-emission energy production and fuel-spill
cleanup. Because current methods to generate a stable vortex are difficult, we
also propose that the blue whirl may serve as a research platform for
fundamental studies of vortices in fluid mechanics.

address this question for a pointlike Unruh-DeWitt detector, coupled linearly
to a real Klein-Gordon field of mass $m\ge0$ and treated within first order
perturbation theory, in the limit of large detector energy gap
$E_{\text{gap}}$. We first show that when the interaction duration $\Delta T$
is fixed, thermality in the sense of detailed balance cannot hold as
$E_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$, and this property generalises from the Unruh effect
to any Kubo-Martin-Schwinger state satisfying certain technical conditions. We
then specialise to a massless field in four spacetime dimensions and show that
detailed balance does hold when $\Delta T$ grows as a power-law in
$E_{\text{gap}}$ as $E_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$, provided the switch-on and
switch-off intervals are stretched proportionally to $\Delta T$ and the
switching function has sufficiently strong Fourier decay. By contrast, if
$\Delta T$ grows by stretching a plateau in which the interaction remains at
constant strength but keeping the duration of the switch-on and switch-off
intervals fixed, detailed balance at $E_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$ requires $\Delta
T$ to grow faster than any polynomial in $E_{\text{gap}}$, under mild technical
conditions. These results also hold for a static detector in a Minkowski heat
bath.
  The results limit the utility of the large $E_{\text{gap}}$ regime as a probe
of thermality in time-dependent versions of the Hawking and Unruh effects, such
as an observer falling into a radiating black hole. They may also have
implications on the design of prospective experimental tests of the Unruh
effect.

Such orbits could be the
result of strong scatterings with other giant planets. The same dynamical
instability that produces these scatterings may also cause habitable planets in
interior orbits to become ejected, destroyed, or be transported out of the
habitable zone. We say that a habitable planet has resilient habitability if it
is able to avoid ejections and collisions and its orbit remains inside the
habitable zone. Here we model the orbital evolution of rocky planets in
planetary systems where giant planets become dynamically unstable. We measure
the resilience of habitable planets as a function of the observed, present-day
masses and orbits of the giant planets. We find that the survival rate of
habitable planets depends strongly on the giant planet architecture. Equal-mass
planetary systems are far more destructive than systems with giant planets of
unequal masses. We also establish a link with observation; we find that giant
planets with present-day eccentricities higher than 0.4 almost never have a
habitable interior planet. For a giant planet with an present-day eccentricity
of 0.2 and semimajor axis of 5 AU orbiting a Sun-like star, 50% of the orbits
in the habitable zone are resilient to the instability. As semimajor axis
increases and eccentricity decreases, a higher fraction of habitable planets
survive and remain habitable. However, if the habitable planet has rocky
siblings, there is a significant risk of rocky planet collisions that would
sterilize the planet.

develop a clear & concise scientific definition. This paper is aimed at laying
the foundations for a new theory concerning the mechanics of information
alongside its intimate relationship with working processes. Principally it aims
to provide a better understanding of what information is. We find that like
entropy, information is also a state variable, and both their values are
surprisingly contextual. Conversely, contrary to popular belief, we find that
information is not negative entropy. However, unlike entropy, information can
be both positive and negative. We further find that it is possible to consider
a communications process as a working process and that Shannon's entropy is
only applicable to the modelling of statistical distributions. In extension, it
appears that information could exist within any system, even thermodynamic
systems at equilibrium. Surprisingly, the amount of mechanical work a
thermodynamic system can do directly relates to the appropriate corresponding
information available. If the system does not have corresponding information,
it can do no work irrespective of how much energy it may contain. Following the
theory we present, it will become evident to the reader that information is an
intrinsic property which exists naturally within our universe, and not an
abstract human notion.

protocol, the main components of the gas mixtures presently used in the
Resistive Plate Chambers systems of the LHC experiments will be most probably
phased out of production in the coming years. Identifying possible replacements
with the adequate characteristics requires an intense R&D, which was recently
started, also in collaborations across the various experiments. Possible
candidates have been proposed and are thoroughly investigated. Some tests on
one of the most promising candidate - HFO-1234ze, an allotropic form of
tetrafluoropropane- have already been reported. Here an innovative approach,
based on the use of Helium, to solve the problems related to the too elevate
operating voltage of HFO-1234ze based gas mixtures, is discussed and the
relative first results are shown.

of 15$\times $15, 25$\times $25, 50$\times $50, and 100$\times $100 $\mu
$m$^2$, manufactured by KETEK, has been investigated. From the current-voltage
characteristics measured with and without illumination by LED light of 470 nm
wavelength, the current-breakdown voltage, $V_I$, and from linear fits of the
voltage dependence of the SiPM gain, measured by recording pulse-area spectra,
the gain-breakdown voltage, $V_G$, have been obtained. The voltage dependence
of the Geiger-breakdown probability was determined from the fraction of zero
photoelectron events with LED illumination. By comparing the results to a model
calculation, the photodetection-breakdown voltage, $V_{PD}$, has been
determined. Within experimental uncertainties, $V_I$ and $V_{PD}$ are equal and
independent of pixel size. For $V_G$, a dependence on pixel size is observed.
The difference $V_I - V_G$ is about 1 V for the SiPM with 15 $\mu $m pixels,
decreases with pixel size and is compatible with zero for the SiPM with 100
$\mu $m pixels.

  Modulation Spaces and Their Interrelations; Applications",,,,,"math.CA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this investigation is to extend basic equations and
inequalities which hold for functions $f$ in a Bernstein space $B_\sigma^2$ to
larger spaces by adding a remainder term which involves the distance of $f$
from $B_\sigma^2$.
  First we present a modification of the classical modulation space
$M^{2,1}(\mathbb{R})$, the so-called readapted modulation space
$M^{2,1}_\text{a}(\mathbb{R})$. Our approach to the latter space and its role
in functional analysis is novel. In fact, we establish several chains of
inclusion relations between $M^{2,1}_\text{a}(\mathbb{R})$ and the more common
Lipschitz and Sobolev spaces, including Sobolev spaces of fractional order.
  Next we introduce an appropriate metric for describing the distance of a
function belonging to one of the latter spaces from a Bernstein space. It will
be used for estimating remainders and studying rates of convergence.
  In the main part, we present the desired extensions. Our applications include
the classical Whittaker-Kotel'nikov-Shannon sampling formula, the reproducing
kernel formula, the Parseval decomposition formula, Bernstein's inequality for
derivatives, and Nikol'ski\u{\i}'s inequality estimating the $l^p(\mathbb{Z})$
norm in terms of the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm.

($z_{em}$=2.197, $\theta =22^{\prime\prime}\!\!.5$) to observe its outflowing
wind through two different sightlines. We present an analysis of three
observations, including two with the Subaru telescope in 2010 February (Misawa
et al. 2013) and 2014 April (Misawa et al. 2014), separated by 4 years, and one
with the Very Large Telescope, separated from the second Subaru observation by
$\sim$2 months. We detect 66 narrow absorption lines (NALs), of which 24 are
classified as intrinsic NALs that are physically associated with the quasar
based on partial coverage analysis. The velocities of intrinsic NALs appear to
cluster around values of $v_{ej}$ $\sim$ 59,000, 43,000, and 29,000 km/s, which
is reminiscent of filamentary structures obtained by numerical simulations.
There are no common intrinsic NALs at the same redshift along the two
sightlines, implying that the transverse size of the NAL absorbers should be
smaller than the sightline distance between two lensed images. In addition to
the NALs with large ejection velocities of $v_{ej}$ > 1,000 km/s, we also
detect broader proximity absorption lines (PALs) at $z_{abs}$ $\sim$ $z_{em}$.
The PALs are likely to arise in outflowing gas at a distance of r $\leq$ 620 pc
from the central black hole with an electron density of $n_e$ $\geq$
8.7$\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$. These limits are based on the assumption that
the variability of the lines is due to recombination. We discuss the
implications of these results on the three-dimensional structure of the
outflow.
