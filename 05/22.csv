share the same feature space and class label space, but have significantly
different distributions. One domain has sufficient labels, named as source

problem is to learn a effective classifier for the target domain. In this
paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for this problem by learning
a partially shared classifier for the target domain, and weighting the source
domain data points. We learn some shared subspaces for both the data points of
the two domains, and a shared classifier in the shared subspaces. We hope that
in the shared subspaces, the distributions of two domain can match each other
well, and to match the distributions, we weight the source domain data points
with different weighting factors. Moreover, we adapt the shared classifier to
each domain by learning different adaptation functions. To learn the subspace
transformation matrices, the classifier parameters, and the adaptation
parameters, we build a objective function with weighted clas- sification
errors, parameter regularization, local reconstruction regularization, and
distribution matching. This objective function is minimized by an itera- tive
algorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness over benchmark data sets,

form of decretion discs. They are often members of binary systems, where it is
expected that the decretion disc interacts both radiatively and gravitationally
with the companion. In this work we study how various orbital (period, mass
ratio and eccentricity) and disc (viscosity) parameters affect the disc
structure in coplanar systems. We simulate such binaries with the use of a
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The main effects of the secondary on the
disc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.
We find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular
or nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in
shape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc is smaller
in size, more elongated and more massive for low viscosity parameter, small
orbital separation and/or high mass ratio. (ii) Highly eccentric orbits are
more complex, with the disc structure and total mass strongly dependent on the
orbital phase and the distance to the secondary. We also study the effects of
binarity in the disc continuum emission. Since the infrared and radio SED are
sensitive to the disc size and density slope, the truncation and matter
accumulation result in considerable modifications in the emergent spectrum. We
conclude that binarity can serve as an explanation for the variability
exhibited in observations of Be stars, and that our model can be used to detect
invisible companions.

mechanisms are far from satisfactory. With lessons learned from how native apps

fundamentally reducing redundant transfers by restructuring the resource
loading of mobile Web apps. ReWAP is based on an efficient mechanism of
resource packaging where stable resources are encapsulated and maintained into
a package, and such a package shall be loaded always from the local storage and
updated by explicitly refreshing. By retrieving and analyzing the update of
resources, ReWAP maintains resource packages that can accurately identify which
resources can be loaded from the local storage for a considerably long period.
ReWAP also provides a wrapper for mobile Web apps to enable loading and
updating resource packages in the local storage as well as loading resources
from resource packages. ReWAP can be easily and seamlessly deployed into
existing mobile Web architectures with minimal modifications, and is
transparent to end-users. We evaluate ReWAP based on continuous 15-day access
traces of 50 mobile Web apps that suffer heavily from the problem of redundant
transfers. Compared to the original mobile Web apps with cache enabled, ReWAP
can significantly reduce the data traffic, with the median saving up to 51%. In
addition, ReWAP can incur only very minor runtime overhead of the client-side
browsers.

  Vol. 31, No.2, 2012",,,,"cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the development of modern industrial technology a large number of
non-linear loads are used in power system, which causes harmonic distortion in
the power system. At the same time the power quality and safe operation becomes
inferior. Therefore mitigation of harmonics is very necessary under the
situation. This paper presents the design of two passive filters to reduce the
current harmonics produced by nonlinear loads in industrial power system.
Matlab /simulink software has been used for the simulation purpose. The results
have been obtained with and without installation of filters and then it is
observed that after installation of filters harmonics of the current are
reduced and power factor is improved.

  Mechanical Energy Density Perspective",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, a new methodology for comparing high power performance of
different piezoelectric materials is presented. When comparing high power
performance of piezoelectric materials of varying compositions and vibration
modes, there exists an inherent problem in comparing the mechanical quality
factor directly. Typically the behavior of the mechanical quality factor is
reported as a function of tip vibration velocity of the sample. This paper
shows why this approach can be inherently problematic and proposes an energy
approach to characterize the mechanical quality factor as the solution. By
utilizing mechanical energy density ($u_{e}$), the mass density of the material
system ($\rho$), and the vibration mode shape (e.g. $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$) of
the sample are accounted for. Therefore, a better method to compare high power
performance of varying piezoelectric compositions is introduced. Furthermore,
the new method is applied to various compositions by using data available in
the literature. As a result, the high power behavior of the materials appear to
be significantly different when the new ""energy density approach"" is used to
compare the mechanical quality factor rather than vibration velocity. Also, the
technique's ability to be utilized to consolidate data from different
resonators to determine anisotropic loss factors is demonstrated on hard and
soft PZT samples of $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$ geometries.

interviews, online surveys and automatic database search. Methods: We asked
open-ended questions to farmers who know the worms, consulted experts and
searched the Internet to document folkloric and artistic instances using all
the names that these animals receive in English, Spanish and Portuguese
(languages of the countries where they occur) as well as other languages, and
automatic image search, in Web of Science, CrossRef, Google Scholar and Google.
Results: We found more than 80 cases of direct references to velvet worms in
folklore and art, mostly from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and New
Zealand. Per capita the countries with more cases are New Zealand (24 cases per
million inhabitants), Costa Rica (16 cases per million inhabitants) and
Australia (3 cases per million inhabitants). The most frequent expressions are
cartoons, followed by tourism agencies using velvet worms in their ads,
products with velvet worm representations, folkloric beliefs, and music bands

perform complex thermally activated biochemical reactions such as the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have applied a 3D computational fluid
dynamics model to resolve the complex flow patterns in such geometries. The
resulting 3D flow trajectories are then used as input to a kinetic model to
resolve the time evolution of DNA replication process. A simple mass action
kinetic model was developed to couple these biochemical reactions with the
intricate flow. Residence time analysis of virtual particles in the flow
revealed that the flow has a strong chaotic component in wider geometries in
comparison with taller geometries (quasi periodic motion). This work shows, for
the first time that the chaotic aspect of the flow field plays a key role in
determining the strength of the coupling between the reactions and the flow.
Our model can quantify the doubling times of these reactions capturing the lag,
exponential and plateau phases of PCR. It predicts that doubling times are
lower in wider geometries, in agreement with experimental results.

of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These
waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is
usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records.
Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a
valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development
of a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals
and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis
techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a
classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm's
performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with
epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained for
both Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70

factorization models that produce essentially unique latent representations of
the data to unravel latent cluster structure -- which is otherwise obscured
because of the freedom to apply an oblique transformation in latent space. At
the same time, latent cluster structure is used as prior information to enhance
the performance of factorization. Specific contributions include several

two invariants of the plastic deformation of the matrix influence the
mechanical response of a porous metallic material. To this end, we first
propose a new isotropic potential for description of the plastic behavior of
the matrix that depends on both invariants of the strain-rate deviator. The
relative weight of the two invariants is described by a material parameter b.
Depending on the sign of the parameter b, the new plastic potential for the
matrix is either interior to von Mises strain-rate potential (b <0), coincides
with it (b =0) or it is exterior to it. Next, an analytic criterion for a
porous solid with matrix governed by the new strain-rate potential is obtained
using rigorous upscaling methods. Analysis is conducted for both tensile and
compressive axisymmetric loading scenarios and spherical void geometry. No
simplifying approximations are considered when estimating the local and overall
plastic dissipation, respectively. It is shown that the value of b has a
drastic influence on all aspects of the mechanical response. There is a value b
= b *<0such that there is almost no influence of J3 on the mechanical response
of the porous solid. If the matrix is characterized by b > b*, the response of
the porous material for tensile loadings and J3>0 is softer than that for
loadings at J3<0. The reverse holds true for b < b *. The noteworthy result is
that irrespective of the value of the parameter b, the response of the porous
solid is harder than that of a porous Tresca material. However, depending on
the value of b, the rate of void growth or collapse can be either faster or
slower than that of a porous Mises material.

capture their respective fragments of quantum mechanics by elegant and succinct
axioms; and both come with their conceptual mysteries. A particularly elegant
and mysterious constraint, imposed on Frobenius algebras to characterize a

contentious issue on the quantum logic side is the modularity law, proposed by
von Neumann to mitigate the failure of distributivity of quantum logical

are formalized in the same framework, then the antispecial law of categorical
quantum mechanics corresponds to the natural requirement of effect algebras
that the units are each other's unique complements; and that the modularity law
corresponds to the Frobenius condition. These correspondences lead to the
equivalence announced in the title. Aligning the two formalisms, at the very
least, sheds new light on the concepts that are more clearly displayed on one
side than on the other (such as e.g. the orthogonality). Beyond that, it may
also open up new approaches to deep and important problems of quantum mechanics

found that it can describe the creation process with rich physical picture,
showing all the creation channels and giving the yields of each channel
specifically. Evenly as a very convenient and powerful detection quantity it
can be applicable to some complicated pair creation processes such as that
triggered by cooperation of two different photons as well as the dynamically

collimated outflows and dense equatorial structures, is a key object in the
study of the poorly understood transition of AGB stars into aspherical
planetary nebulae. Using the STIS instrument onboard HST, we have obtained high
spatial-resolution long-slit optical spectra of V Hya that show high-velocity
emission in [SII] and [FeII] lines. Our dataset, spanning three epochs spaced
apart by a year during each of two periods (in 2002-2004 and 2011-2013), shows
that V Hya ejects high-speed (about 200-250 km/s) bullets once every ~8.5 yr.
The ejection axis flip-flops around a roughly eastern direction, both in and
perpendicular to the sky-plane, and the radial velocities of the ejecta also
vary in concert between low and high values. We propose a model in which the
bullet ejection is associated with the periastron passage of a binary companion
in an eccentric orbit around V Hya with an orbital period of ~8.5 yr. The
flip-flop phenomenon is likely the result of collimated ejection from an
accretion disk (produced by gravitational capture of material from the primary)
that is warped and precessing, and/or that has a magnetic field that is
misaligned with that of the companion or the primary star. We show how a
previously observed 17-year period in V Hya's light-cycle can also be explained
in our model. Additionally, we describe how the model proposed here can be
extended to account for multipolar nebulae.

convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it
is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling
operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability
of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input.
We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically
validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well.
Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a
given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being
separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports
exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being
limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling
geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves
as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as
commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones,
orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other
pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the
network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In
addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only
linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions
brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation
under favored partitions of the input.

others or the quantum bus it connected to, but as the number of qubits
increases this becomes problematic to achieve in practice due to frequency
crowding issues. Here, we demonstrate that by applying a fast longitudinal
control field to the target qubit, we can turn off its couplings to other
qubits or buses (in principle on/off ratio higher than 100 dB). This has
important implementations in superconducting circuits as it means we can keep
the qubits at their optimal points, where the coherence properties are
greatest, during coupling/decoupling processing. Our approach suggests a new
way to control coupling among qubits and data buses that can be naturally
scaled up to large quantum processors without the need for auxiliary circuits
and yet be free of the frequency crowding problems.

InfraRed Intensive Transient Survey (SPIRITS), an ongoing systematic search for

decrease measured ~150 d before and ~80 d after the initial outburst,
respectively, reveal a mid-IR counterpart to the coincident optical and high

address the leading interpretation of SN 2010da as an eruption from a luminous

2010da is instead a supergiant (sg)B[e]-HMXB based on similar luminosities and
dust masses exhibited by two other known sgB[e]-HMXB systems. Additionally, the
SN 2010da progenitor occupies a similar region on a mid-IR color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) with known sgB[e] stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The lower
limit estimated for the orbital eccentricity of the sgB[e]-HMXB (e>0.82) from

the claim that SN 2010da may be associated with a newly formed HMXB system.

Many qualitative features of the emerging collective phenomena, such as
correlated activity, stability, response to inputs, chaotic and regular

treatment in statistical mechanics, or, more precisely, classical statistical
field theory.
  This tutorial presents the fundamentals behind contemporary developments in
the theory of neural networks of rate units that are based on methods from
statistical mechanics of classical systems with a large number of interacting
degrees of freedom. In particular we will focus on a relevant class of systems
that have quenched (time independent) disorder. In neural networks, the main
source of disorder arises from random synaptic couplings between neurons. These
systems are in many respects similar to spin glasses. The tutorial therefore
also explains the methods for these disordered systems as far as they are
applied in neuroscience.
  The presentation consists of two parts. In the first part we introduce
stochastic differential equations in the Martin - Siggia - Rose - De Dominicis
- Janssen path integral formalism. In the second part we employ this language
to derive the dynamic mean-field theory for deterministic random networks, the
basis of the seminal work by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, Sommers 1988, as well as a

systems with the giant planet interior to the HZ no SR can occur in the
Newtonian framework. Taking into account the general relativistic precession of
the perihelion, which increases the precession frequencies, planets with $a <
0.1$ au can cause SR in the HZ. We find two cases where the SR is located
inside the HZ, and some more where it is close to the HZ. Generally, giant
planets interior to the HZ are more favourable than exterior planets to avoid
SR in the HZ. Around the location of the SR weaker mean-motion resonances are
excited, and resonance overlap is possible. Existing analytical models are not
as accurate as the semi-analytical method in locating the SR and deviate by
$\sim 0.1$ au or more.

reconstruction algorithm with multiple SI using adaptive weights (RAMSIA) to
robustly exploit the multiple SIs with different qualities. We experimentally
perform our algorithm on generated sparse signals and also correlated feature

structures, in terms of transmission pathways, loss of immunity, and other
features. These differences may yield different predictions and parameter
estimates from the same data. Given the increasing use of models to inform
public health decision-making, it is important to assess distinguishability
(whether models can be distinguished based on fit to data) and inference
robustness (whether model inferences are robust to realistic variations in
model structure). We examined the effects of uncertainty in model structure in
epidemic cholera, testing a range of models based on known features of cholera
epidemiology. We fit to simulated epidemic and long-term data, as well as data
from the 2006 Angola epidemic. We evaluated model distinguishability based on
data fit, and whether parameter values and forecasts can accurately be inferred
from incidence data. In general, all models were able to successfully fit to
all data sets, even if misspecified. However, in the long-term data, the best
model fits were achieved when the loss of immunity form matched those of the
model that simulated the data. Two transmission and reporting parameters were
accurately estimated across all models, while the remaining showed broad
variation across the different models and data sets. Forecasting efforts were
not successful early, but once the epidemic peak had been achieved, most models
showed similar accuracy. Our results suggest that we are unlikely to be able to

down to $0.0012\pm0.00012$ for Fe$_{1.75}$Co$_{1.25}$Si. The effective damping

hole (BH) X-ray binary LMC X-3. We estimate the properties of the system at 4
evolutionary stages: 1) at the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), 2) just prior to
the supernova (SN) explosion of the primary, 3) just after the SN, and 4) at
the moment of RLO onset.We use a hybrid approach, combining detailed stellar
structure and binary evolution calculations with approximate population
synthesis models. This allows us to estimate potential natal kicks and the
evolution of the BH spin. In the whole analysis we incorporate as model
constraints the most up-to-date observational information, encompassing the
binary's orbital properties, the companion star mass, effective temperature,
surface gravity and radius, as well as the black hole's mass and spin. We find
that LMC X-3 began as a ZAMS system with the mass of the primary star in the
range $M_{\rm{1,ZAMS}}$ = 22-31 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and a secondary star of
$M_{\rm{2,ZAMS}} = 5.0-8.3M_{\odot}$, in a wide ($P_{ZAMS} \gtrsim 2.000\, \rm
days$) and eccentric ($e_{\rm{ZAMS}} \gtrsim 0.23$) orbit. Just prior to the
SN, the primary has a mass of $M_{\mathrm{1,preSN}} = 11.1-18.0\,\rm
M_{\odot}$, with the secondary star largely unaffected. The orbital period
decreases to $0.6-1.7\, \rm days$, and is still eccentric $0 \leq
e_{\rm{preSN}} \leq 0.44$. We find that a symmetric SN explosion with no or
small natal kicks (a few tens of $\rm km\, s^{-1}$) imparted on the BH cannot
be formally excluded, however, large natal kicks in excess of $\gtrsim 120

  oscillation","Soft Matter, 2016",,"10.1039/c6sm00788k",,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a new method to characterize the spatial distribution of
particles' vibrations in solids with much lower computational costs compared to
the usual normal mode analysis. We excite the specific vibrational mode in a
two dimensional athermal jammed system by giving a small amplitude of active
oscillation to each particle's size with an identical driving frequency. The
response is then obtained as the real time displacements of the particles. We
show remarkable correlations between the real time displacements and the eigen
vectors obtained from conventional normal mode analysis. More importantly, from
these real time displacements, we can measure the participation ratio and
spatial polarization of particles' vibrations. From these measurements, we find
three distinct frequency regimes which characterize the spatial distribution
and correlation of particles' vibrations in jammed amorphous solids.
Furthermore, we can possibly apply this method to a much larger system to
examine the low frequency behaviour of amorphous solids with a much higher
resolution of the frequency space.

  to Ancillary Service Provision",,,"10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741402",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyzes the pessimistic effect on the inherent load shifting
potential (LSP) of buildings due to the participation in the reserve market. A
generic model-based optimization approach is deployed, which uses a validated
dynamic model along with its experienced external and internal disturbances, to
quantify the LSP in the presence of various price signals. The theoretical
maximum LSP is obtained using a base energy price without the provision of
ancillary services (AS). The deviation from the base case LSP is observed after
including the time varying energy and the reserve price from the spot market.
Factors affecting the LSP are found to be as: (1) physics of the model, (2) the
nature of price signal and (3) the competency of the reserve price with respect
to the energy price. Due to its simple formulation, low computation
requirements, and modular nature, the method proposed in this paper can easily
be deployed by retailers and system operators for the assessment of monetary
incentives as well as qualified load type for various demand response (DR)
services in liberalized markets.

  Locally Triangle-Free",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we show the existence of a polynomial time graph isomorphism
algorithm for all graphs excluding graphs that are locally trianglefree. This
particular class of graphs allows to divide the graph into neighbourhood
sub-graph where each of induced sub-graph (neighbourhood) has at least 2
vertices. We construct all possible permutations for each induced sub-graph
using a search tree. We construct automorphisms of subgraphs based on these
permutations. Finally, we decide isomorphism through automorphisms .
  The author expects that the solution, present in this paper, may lead to a
faster algorithm for the general case of graph isomorphism (using "" barycentric
subdivision"" ). The paper might affect group isomorphism also as we may
construct graphs (corresponds to a particular group) in way so we can avoid it
to be a triangle free graph. Since,for a given group G , each choice of a
generating set will give a different Cayley graph.
