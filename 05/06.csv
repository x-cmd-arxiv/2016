nematic couplings on a non-bipartite triangular lattice are investigated in the
exchange interactions parameter space. We demonstrate that the model displays a
number of ordered and quasi-ordered phases as a result of geometrical
frustration and/or competition between the magnetic and generalized nematic
interactions. The nature and the extent of the respective phases depend on the
parameter $q$, characterizing the higher-order harmonics term in the
Hamiltonian. Motivated by the recent discovery of the experimental realization
of the model with $q=2$ in the seemingly unrelated field of the systems
chemistry [A.B. Cairns et al., Nature Chemistry 8, 442 (2016)], the model for
$q>2$ is discussed in the context of the prediction of structural phases of a
class of bimetalic cyanides based on a mapping between the two systems.

We present a framework for the systematic construction of flux-based graphs

directionality of metabolic fluxes via edges that represent the flow of
metabolites from source to target reactions. The methodology can be applied in
the absence of a specific biological context by modelling fluxes
probabilistically, or can be tailored to different environmental conditions by
incorporating flux distributions computed through constraint-based approaches
such as Flux Balance Analysis. We illustrate our approach on the central carbon

The flux-dependent graphs under various environmental conditions and genetic
perturbations exhibit systemic changes in their topological and community

importance of specific reactions and pathways. By integrating constraint-based
models and tools from network science, our framework allows the study of

show that the column density of the clouds varies significantly across the

appropriate Wess-Zumino-Witten models) is retained by quantum $W$-symmetries
when the horizon area is not preserved due to Hawking radiation. It is key that
the exactly-marginal conformal world-sheet operator representing a massless
stringy particle interacting with the black hole requires a contribution from
$W_\infty$ generators in its vertex function. The latter correspond to
delocalised, non-propagating, string excitations that guarantee the transfer of
information between the string black hole and external particles. When
infalling matter crosses the horizon, these topological states are excited via
a process: (Stringy black hole) + infalling matter $\rightarrow $ (Stringy
black hole)$^\star$, where the black hole is viewed as a stringy state with a
specific configuration of $W_\infty$ charges that are conserved. Hawking
radiation is then the reverse process, with conservation of the $W_\infty$
charges retaining information. The Hawking radiation spectrum near the horizon
of a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole is specified by matrix elements of
higher-order currents that form a phase-space $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show
that an appropriate gauging of this algebra preserves the horizon
two-dimensional area classically, as expected because the latter is a conserved

connection between the restricted isometry property (RIP) and the sparsity
parameter for a vast volume of hard thresholding based algorithms, which
renders an improvement on the RIP condition especially when the true sparsity
is unknown. This suggests that in essence, many more kinds of sensing matrices
or fewer measurements are admissible for the data acquisition procedure.
  Machine Learning. In terms of large-scale machine learning, a significant yet
challenging problem is learning accurate sparse models in an efficient manner.
In stark contrast to prior work that attempted the $\ell_1$-relaxation for
promoting sparsity, we present a novel stochastic algorithm which performs hard
thresholding in each iteration, hence ensuring such parsimonious solutions.
Equipped with the developed bound, we prove the {\em global linear convergence}
for a number of prevalent statistical models under mild assumptions, even
though the problem turns out to be non-convex.

evolution of massive stars, the supernova explosion mechanism, and the
equation-of-state of cold, nuclear matter beyond the nuclear saturation
density. A number of recent NS mass measurements in binary millisecond pulsar
(MSP) systems increase the fraction of massive NSs (with $M > 1.8$ M$_{\odot}$)
to $\sim 20\% $ of the observed population. In light of these results, we
employ a Bayesian framework to revisit the MSP mass distribution. We find that
a single Gaussian model does not sufficiently describe the observed population.
We test alternative empirical models and infer that the MSP mass distribution
is strongly asymmetric. The diversity in spin and orbital properties of
high-mass NSs suggests that this is most likely not a result of the recycling
process, but rather reflects differences in the NS birth masses. The asymmetry
is best accounted for by a bimodal distribution with a low mass component
centred at $1.393_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$ M$_{\odot}$ and dispersed by
$0.064_{-0.025}^{+0.064}$ M$_{\odot}$, and a high-mass component with a mean of
$1.807_{-0.132}^{+0.081}$ and a dispersion of $0.177_{-0.072}^{+0.115}$
M$_{\odot}$. We also establish a lower limit of $M_{max} \ge 2.018$ M$_{\odot}$
at 98% C.L. for the maximum NS mass, from the absence of a high-mass truncation
in the observed masses. Using our inferred model, we find that the measurement
of 350 MSP masses, expected after the conclusion of pulsar surveys with the
Square-Kilometre Array, can result in a precise localization of a maximum mass
up to 2.15 M$_{\odot}$, with a 5% accuracy. Finally, we identify possible
massive NSs within the known pulsar population and discuss birth masses of
MSPs.

mode (EB), which are most sensitive to the effect. We build specific, so-called
D-estimators for birefringence and assess their performances and error budgets
by using realistic Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimental
characteristics provided by the ACTpol collaboration. We determine the optimal
multipole range for our analysis to be $250 < \ell < 3025$ over which we find a

features that make them attractive for wind and marine renewable energy. To
maximize power output, the turbine blade kinematics may be controlled during
the course of the blade revolution, thus optimizing the unsteady fluid dynamic
forces. Dynamically pitching the blades, similar to blade control in a
helicopter, is an established method. However, this technique adds undesirable
mechanical complexity to the turbine, increasing cost and reducing durability.
Here we introduce a novel alternative requiring no additional moving parts: we
optimize the turbine rotation rate as a function of blade position resulting in
motion (including changes in the effective angle of attack) that is precisely
timed to exploit unsteady fluid effects. We demonstrate experimentally that
this approach results in a 79% increase in power output over industry standard
control methods. Analysis of the fluid forcing and blade kinematics show that
maximal power is achieved through alignment of fluid force and rotation rate
extrema. In addition, the optimized controller excites a well-timed dynamic
stall vortex, as is found in many examples of biological propulsion. This
control strategy allows a structurally robust turbine operating at relatively
low angular velocity to achieve high efficiency and could enable a new
generation of environmentally-benign turbines for wind and water current power
generation.

crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is approached. Based on a two-band prototype
system with one shallow and one deep band, we demonstrate that the fundamental
phase diagram of the superconducting magnetic response changes qualitatively as
compared to standard superconductors with only deep bands. The so-called
intertype (IT) domain between superconductivity types I and II systematically
expands in the phase diagram when passing from the BCS to BEC side: its width
is inversely proportional to the squared Cooper-pair radius that shrinks
several orders of magnitude through the crossover. We also show that the
coupling to a stable condensate of the deep band makes the system rather robust
against the otherwise strong superconducting fluctuations. Thus, the BCS-BEC
crossover induced by a shallow band pushes standard superconductivity types
wide apart so that the IT domain tends to dominate the phase diagram and
therefore the magnetic properties of shallow-band superconductors.

associate functionality to regions in the environment. Our goal is to automate
dense functional understanding of large spaces by leveraging sparse activity
demonstrations recorded from an ego-centric viewpoint. The method we describe
enables functionality estimation in large scenes where people have behaved, as
well as novel scenes where no behaviors are observed. Our method learns and
predicts ""Action Maps"", which encode the ability for a user to perform
activities at various locations. With the usage of an egocentric camera to
observe human activities, our method scales with the size of the scene without
the need for mounting multiple static surveillance cameras and is well-suited
to the task of observing activities up-close. We demonstrate that by capturing
appearance-based attributes of the environment and associating these attributes
with activity demonstrations, our proposed mathematical framework allows for
the prediction of Action Maps in new environments. Additionally, we offer a
preliminary glance of the applicability of Action Maps by demonstrating a
proof-of-concept application in which they are used in concert with activity
detections to perform localization.

roughness or fractal dimension. However, a broad class of real-world signals
have a high-frequency slope, like fBm, but a plateau in the vicinity of zero
frequency. This low-frequency plateau, it is shown, implies that the temporal

is known that without arity bounds exclusion logic is equivalent with
dependence logic. By observing the translations, we see that the expressive
power of EXC[k] lies in between k-ary and (k+1)-ary dependence logics. We will
show that, at least in the case of k=1, the both of these inclusions are
proper.
  In a recent work by the author it was shown that k-ary inclusion-exclusion
logic is equivalent with k-ary existential second order logic, ESO[k]. We will
show that, on the level of sentences, it is possible to simulate inclusion
atoms with exclusion atoms, and this way express ESO[k]-sentences by using only
k-ary exclusion atoms. For this translation we also need to introduce a novel
method for ""unifying"" the values of certain variables in a team. As a
consequence, EXC[k] captures ESO[k] on the level of sentences, and we get a
strict arity hierarchy for exclusion logic. It also follows that k-ary
inclusion logic is strictly weaker than EXC[k].
  Finally we will use similar techniques to formulate a translation from ESO[k]
to k-ary inclusion logic with strict semantics. Consequently, for any arity
fragment of inclusion logic, strict semantics is more expressive than lax
semantics.

characterized by two time-independent sets of rules (also called steps) which
have a privileged direction of increase and are therefore essentially
one-dimensional objects. Depending on the spatial coordinate, one of the two
sets of rules applies, namely one for altitude 0 and one for altitude bigger
than 0. The abscissa y=0 thus acts as a border which either absorbs or reflects
steps. The absorption model corresponds to the model analyzed by Banderier and
Flajolet (""Analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths""), while the
reflecting model leads to a more complicated situation. We show how the
generating functions are then modified: the kernel method strikes again but
here it unfortunately does not give a nice product formula. This makes the
analysis more challenging, and, in the case of {\L}ukasiewicz walks, we give
the asymptotics for the number of excursions, arches and meanders. Limit laws
for the number of returns to 0 of excursions are given. We also compute the
limit laws of the final altitude of meanders. The full analytic situation is
more complicated than the Banderier-Flajolet model (partly because new
""critical compositions"" appear, forcing us to introduce new key quantities,

drift at 0 play a role in the ""universal"" behavior of such walks.

contrast, the proactive caching of popular content at the ENs allows for the
low-latency delivery of the cached files, but with generally limited
opportunities for cooperative transmission among the ENs. The interplay between
cloud processing and edge caching is addressed from an information-theoretic
viewpoint by investigating the fundamental limits of a high
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) metric, termed normalized delivery time (NDT),
which captures the worst-case coding latency for delivering any requested

of minimizing the NDT. Information-theoretic lower bounds on the NDT are also
derived. Achievability arguments and lower bounds are leveraged to characterize

depolarizing phase of the action potential in most nerve cells, and
Na$_\mathrm{v}$ channel localization to the axon initial segment is vital to
action potential initiation. Na$_\mathrm{v}$ channels in the soma play a role
in the transfer of axonal output information to the rest of the neuron and in
synaptic plasticity, although little is known about Na$_\mathrm{v}$ channel
localization and dynamics within this neuronal compartment. This study uses
single-particle tracking and photoactivation localization microscopy to analyze
cell-surface Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 within the soma of cultured hippocampal
neurons. Mean-square displacement analysis of individual trajectories indicated
that half of the somatic Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 channels localized to stable
nanoclusters $\sim$230 nm in diameter. Strikingly, these domains were
stabilized at specific sites on the cell membrane for >30 min, notably via an
ankyrin-independent mechanism, indicating that the means by which
Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 nanoclusters are maintained in the soma is biologically
different from axonal localization. Nonclustered Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 channels
showed anomalous diffusion, as determined by mean-square-displacement analysis.
High-density single-particle tracking of Na$_\mathrm{v}$ channels labeled with
photoactivatable fluorophores in combination with Bayesian inference analysis
was employed to characterize the surface nanoclusters. A subpopulation of
mobile Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 was observed to be transiently trapped in the
nanoclusters. Somatic Na$_\mathrm{v}$1.6 nanoclusters represent a new, to our
knowledge, type of Na$_\mathrm{v}$ channel localization, and are hypothesized
to be sites of localized channel regulation.

peculiar optical properties in the presence of oxygen vacancies or intercalated
alkali atoms have been observed and investigated for a long time. In this paper
we propose a rationalization of experiments based on first-principles
calculations of optical and electrical properties of oxygen deficient (reduced)
WO$_3$. Our approach is based on a parameter-free dielectric-dependent hybrid
density functional methodology, used in combination with the charge transition
levels formalism, for studying excitation mechanisms in the presence of
defects. Our results indicate that oxygen vacancies lead to a different physics
in $\gamma$-monoclinic WO$_3$, depending on the orientation of the W-O-W chain
where the vacancy is created, thus evidencing strong anisotropic effects rooted
in the peculiar structural properties of the original nondefective monoclinic
cell. Different types of oxygen vacancies can hence be classified on the basis
of the calculated ground state properties, electronic structure, and
excitation/emission energies, giving a satisfactory explanation to a range of
experimental observations made on oxygen deficient WO$_3$.

its exceptionally close approach to Earth during May of 2014, the third
smallest perigee of any comet in two centuries. These circumstances permitted
us to pursue several studies of this intrinsically faint object, including
measurements of gas and dust production rates, searching for coma morphology,
and direct detection of the nucleus to measure its properties. Indeed, we
successfully measured the lowest water production rates of an intact comet in
over 35 years and a corresponding smallest active area, ~0.007 km^2. When
combined with the nucleus size found from radar (Howell et al. 2014), this also
yields the smallest active fraction for any comet, ~0.024%. In all, this
strongly suggests that 209P/LINEAR is on its way to becoming an inert object.
The nucleus was detected but could not easily be disentangled from the inner
coma due to seeing variations and changing spatial scales. Even so, we were
able to measure a double-peaked lightcurve consistent with the shorter of two
viable rotational periods found by Hergenrother (2014). Radial profiles of the
dust coma are quite steep, similar to that observed for some other very anemic
comets and suggestive that vaporizing icy grains are present.

the determination of the dissipation mechanism which is most efficient in

gravitational-wave or electromagnetic losses. We here consider the latter and
compute the energy losses in the form of Poynting fluxes, Joule heating and
Ohmic dissipation in a relativistic oscillating spherical star with a dipolar
magnetic field in vacuum. While this approach is not particularly realistic for
rapidly rotating stars, it has the advantage that it is fully analytic and that
it provides expressions for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the
most common modes of oscillation both in the vicinity of the star and far away
from it. In this way we revisit and extend to a relativistic context the
classical estimates of McDermott et al. Overall, we find that
general-relativistic corrections lead to electromagnetic damping time-scales
that are at least one order of magnitude smaller than in Newtonian gravity.
Furthermore, with the only exception of $g$ (gravity) modes, we find that $f$

structure which allows one to plug in any off-the-shelf image denoising
algorithm for a subproblem in the ADMM algorithm. Because of the plug-in

Plug-and-Play ADMM has demonstrated promising empirical results in a number of
recent papers. However, it is unclear under what conditions and by using what
denoising algorithms would it guarantee convergence. Also, since Plug-and-Play
ADMM uses a specific way to split the variables, it is unclear if fast

problems.
  In this paper, we propose a Plug-and-Play ADMM algorithm with provable fixed

asymptotic criteria, called bounded denoisers, Plug-and-Play ADMM converges to
a fixed point under a continuation scheme. We also present fast implementations
for two image restoration problems on super-resolution and single-photon

counterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These

remedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum

mutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in
nature---suggesting a ""many interacting worlds"" interpretation. It is shown
that the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation
results in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In
particular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and
its spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally,
the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through
spacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic
quantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.

translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 1D spin chain is
QMAEXP-complete, even for systems of low local dimension (roughly 40). This is
an improvement over the best previously-known result by several orders of
magnitude, and it shows that spin-glass-like frustration can occur in
translationally-invariant quantum systems with a local dimension comparable to
the smallest-known non-translationally-invariant systems with similar
behaviour.
  While previous constructions of such systems rely on standard models of
quantum computation, we construct a new model that is particularly well-suited
for encoding quantum computation into the ground state of a
translationally-invariant system. This allows us to shift the proof burden from
optimizing the Hamiltonian encoding a standard computational model to proving
universality of a simple model.
  Previous techniques for encoding quantum computation into the ground state of
a local Hamiltonian allow only a linear sequence of gates, hence only a linear
(or nearly linear) path in the graph of all computational states. We extend
these techniques by allowing significantly more general paths, including
branching and cycles, thus enabling a highly efficient encoding of our
computational model. However, this requires more sophisticated techniques for
analysing the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian. To address this, we
introduce a framework of graphs with unitary edge labels. After relating our
Hamiltonian to the Laplacian of such a unitary labelled graph, we analyse its
spectrum by combining matrix analysis and spectral graph theory techniques.

occurrence rate of TDEs per unit volume as a function of peak luminosity and
redshift, utilizing an unbiased sample observed by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray

decay with an index of $-5/3$, a systematic search using the MAXI data in the
first 37 months detected four TDEs, all of which have been found in the
literature. To formulate the TDE XLF, we consider the mass function of SMBHs,
that of disrupted stars, the specific TDE rate as a function of SMBH mass, and
the fraction of TDEs with relativistic jets. We perform an unbinned maximum
likelihood fit to the MAXI TDE list and check the consistency with the observed
TDE rate in the ROSAT all sky survey. The results suggest that the intrinsic
fraction of the jet-accompanying events is $0.0007$--$34\%$. We confirm that at

functions of active galactic nuclei is not significant and hence that their
contribution to the growth of SMBHs is negligible at the redshifts.

catastrophic cooling in galaxy clusters. However, how the feedback energy is
transformed into heat, and how the AGN jets heat the intracluster medium (ICM)
isotropically, still remain elusive. In this work, we gain insights into the
relative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet
feedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the
properties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet
cones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains
entropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.
Outside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough
to overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.
Consequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over
billions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling
as the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy
is supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as
adiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the
fluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat
provided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any
process is necessary. Throughout the cluster evolution, turbulent energy is
only at the percent level compared to gas thermal energy, and thus turbulent
heating is not the main source of heating in our simulation.

find a good agreement for large $g$, which is the perturbative regime of the

exhibits a deviation compatible with the presence of quadratic divergences.
After their non-perturbative subtraction the continuum limit can be taken, and
suggests a qualitative agreement with the non-perturbative expectation from
AdS/CFT. Furthermore, we detect a phase in the fermion determinant, whose
origin we explain, that for very small $g$ leads to a sign problem not
treatable via standard reweigthing. The continuum extrapolations of the

strongly suggesting that they lead to the same continuum limit. Part of the

the halo. In contrast, if the central is perpendicular to the satellite system,

for thick/hot discs, with $H/R\gtrsim 0.1$, the binary torque does not prevent
the gas from penetrating the cavity formed in the disc by the binary (in line
with previous investigations). The situation drastically changes for thinner
discs, in this case the mass accretion rate is suppressed, such that only a
fraction (linearly dependent on $H/R$) of the available gas is able to flow
within the cavity and accrete on to the binary. Extrapolating this result to
the cold and thin accretion discs expected around supermassive black hole
binary systems implies that this kind of systems accretes less material than
predicted so far, with consequences not only for the electromagnetic and
gravitational waves emissions during the late inspiral phase but also for the
recoil speed of the black hole formed after binary coalescence, thus
influencing also the evolutionary path both of the binary and of the host

the factorization and renormalization scales, the scale of the Yukawa coupling,

central renormalization scale of $m_H$/2, which is halfway between the values
typically chosen in the 4-flavor and 5-flavor scheme calculations. We evaluate
the parametric uncertainties due to the PDFs and the b-quark mass, and in

relatively late phases of the supernova evolution. Photoionisation, however, is
predicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks

have obtained photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of SNe Ia 2013gh and
iPTF 13dge, to search for absorption- line variations. Furthermore, we study
interstellar absorption features in relation to the observed photometric
colours of the SNe. Results. Both SNe display deep Na I D and Ca II H&K

with either geometric effects of rapidly moving or patchy gas clouds or
photoionisation of Na I gas at R \approx 1019 cm from the explosion. Our
analysis indicates that it is necessary to focus on early phases to detect
photoionisation effects of gases in the circumstellar medium of SNe Ia.
Different absorbers such as Na I and Ca II can be used to probe for matter at

black hole accretion rates of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on
observations at X-ray wavelengths, the observed Eddington ratio distribution
appears as a power law, while optical studies have often yielded a lognormal
distribution. There is increasing evidence that these observed discrepancies
may be due to contamination by star formation and other selection effects.
Using a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we
test if an intrinsic Eddington ratio distribution that takes the form of a
Schechter function is consistent with previous work that suggests that young
galaxies in optical surveys have an observed lognormal Eddington ratio
distribution. We simulate the optical emission line properties of a population
of galaxies and AGN using a broad instantaneous luminosity distribution
described by a Schechter function near the Eddington limit. This simulated AGN
population is then compared to observed galaxies via the positions on an
emission line excitation diagram and Eddington ratio distributions. We present
an improved method for extracting the AGN distribution using BPT diagnostics
that allows us to probe over one order of magnitude lower in Eddington ratio
counteracting the effects of dilution by star formation. We conclude that for
optically selected AGN in young galaxies, the intrinsic Eddington ratio
distribution is consistent with a possibly universal, broad power law with an
exponential cutoff, as this distribution is observed in old optically selected
galaxies and in X-rays.

atomic memory objects in large scale asynchronous distributed storage systems.
When compared with the traditional replication based schemes, erasure codes
have the potential of significantly lowering storage and communication costs
while simultaneously guaranteeing the desired resiliency levels. In this work,
we propose the Storage-Optimized Data-Atomic (SODA) algorithm for implementing
atomic memory objects in the multi-writer multi-reader setting. SODA uses
Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, and is specifically designed to
optimize the total storage cost for a given fault-tolerance requirement. For
tolerating $f$ server crashes in an $n$-server system, SODA uses an $[n, k]$
MDS code with $k=n-f$, and incurs a total storage cost of $\frac{n}{n-f}$. SODA
is designed under the assumption of reliable point-to-point communication
channels. The communication cost of a write and a read operation are
respectively given by $O(f^2)$ and $\frac{n}{n-f}(\delta_w+1)$, where
$\delta_w$ denotes the number of writes that are concurrent with the particular
read. In comparison with the recent CASGC algorithm, which also uses MDS codes,
SODA offers lower storage cost while pays more on the communication cost.
  We also present a modification of SODA, called SODA$_{\text{err}}$, to handle
the case where some of the servers can return erroneous coded elements during a
read operation. Specifically, in order to tolerate $f$ server failures and $e$
error-prone coded elements, the SODA$_{\text{err}}$ algorithm uses an $[n, k]$
MDS code such that $k=n-2e-f$. SODA$_{\text{err}}$ also guarantees liveness and
atomicity, while maintaining an optimized total storage cost of
$\frac{n}{n-f-2e}$.

the difference of this progressive reconstruction with respect to the input can
be seen as minimizing the number of active output units required for the
reconstruction of the input. The model thus learns to reconstruct optimally
using the least number of active output units. This leads to high sparsity
without the need for extra hyperparameters, the amount of sparsity is instead
implicitly learned by minimizing this progressive reconstruction error. Results
of the trained model are given for patches of the CIFAR10 dataset, showing
rapid convergence of features and extremely sparse output activations while
maintaining a minimal reconstruction error and showing extreme robustness to
overfitting. Additionally the reconstruction as function of number of active
units is presented which shows the autoencoder learns a rank order code over

spectrum changes not only in normalisation, but also in spectral shape. Using
several different spectral models which parameterise the blackbody and
power-law components seen in the time-averaged spectrum, we find that both
components are required to vary, although the fractional rms amplitude of
blackbody emission is small, ~1.4 per cent compared to ~25 per cent for the
power-law emission. However the blackbody variation leads the power-law
variation by ~0.3 in relative phase (~110 degrees), giving a significant break
in the Fourier lag-energy spectrum that our phase-resolved spectral models are
able to reproduce. Our results support a geometric interpretation for the QPO
variations where the blackbody variation and its phase relation to the
power-law are explained by quasi-periodic heating of the approaching and
receding sides of the disc by a precessing Comptonising region. The small
amplitude of blackbody variations suggests that the Comptonising region
producing the QPO has a relatively large scale-height, and may be linked to the
base of the jet, as has previously been suggested to explain the binary orbit
inclination-dependence of Type B QPO amplitudes.

tomographic setup, accurate reconstruction is still possible with $270^{\circ}$
coverage which is called the minimal-scan angle range. This can be done by
applying weighing functions (or filters) on projection data of the object to
eliminate the redundancies and accurately reconstruct the image from this lower
angular coverage. This paper demonstrates procedures to generate many general
classes of these weighing filters. These are all equivalent at $270^{\circ}$
coverage but would perform differently at lower angular coverages and under
presence of noise. This paper does a comparative analysis of different filters
when angular coverage is lower than minimal-scan angle of $270^{\circ}$.
Simulation studies have been done to find optimum weight filters for
sub-minimal angular coverage. The optimum weights can generate images
comparable to a full $360^{\circ}$ coverage FBPP reconstruction. Performance of
these in presence of noise is also analyzed. These algorithms are capable of

intersection curves, we treat meshes as adaptive surfaces which can be
arbitrarily refined. Rather than depending on computing precise face
intersections, our approach refines the input meshes in the intersection
regions, then discards intersecting triangles and fills the resulting holes
with high-quality triangles. The original intersection curves are approximated
to a user-definable precision, and our method can identify and preserve creases
and sharp features. Advantages of our approach include the ability to trade
speed for accuracy, support for open meshes, and the ability to incorporate
tolerances to handle cases where large numbers of faces are slightly
inter-penetrating or near-coincident.

be active. Ice photodesorption was proposed to explain the abundances of
gas-phase molecules toward the coldest regions. Laboratory experiments were
performed to investigate the potential photodesorption of methanol toward the
coldest regions. Solid methanol was deposited at 8 K and UV-irradiated at
various temperatures starting from 8 K. The irradiation of the ice was
monitored by means of infrared spectroscopy and the molecules in the gas phase
were detected using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. Fully deuterated methanol was
used for confirmation of the results. The photodesorption of methanol to the
gas phase was not observed in the mass spectra at different irradiation
temperatures. We estimate an upper limit of 3x10e-5 molecules per incident
photon. On the other hand, photon-induced desorption of the main photoproducts
was clearly observed. The negligible photodesorption of methanol could be
explained by the ability of UV-photons in the 114 - 180 nm (10.87 - 6.88 eV)
range to dissociate this molecule efficiently. Therefore, the presence of
gas-phase methanol in the absence of thermal desorption remains unexplained. On

not found to desorb in the pure CH_4 ice irradiation experiments.

media which exhibits a transition from normal to anomalous diffusion. The model
consists of a set of non-interacting overdamped particles moving on a
disordered potential. The disordered potential can be thought as a substrate
having some ""defects"" scattered along a one-dimensional line. The distance
between two contiguous defects is assumed to have a heavy-tailed distribution
with a given exponent $\alpha$, which means that the defects along the
substrate are scarce if $\alpha$ is small. We prove that this system exhibits a
transition from normal to anomalous diffusion when the distribution exponent
$\alpha$ decreases, i.e., when the defects become scarcer. Thus we identify
three distinct scenarios: a normal diffusive phase for $\alpha>2$, a
superdiffusive phase for $1/2<\alpha\leq 2$, and a subdiffusive phase for
$\alpha \leq 1/2$. We also prove that the particle current is finite for all
the values of $\alpha$, which means that the transport is normal independently
of the diffusion regime (normal, subdiffusive, or superdiffusive). We give
analytical expressions for the effective diffusion coefficient for the normal
diffusive phase and analytical expressions for the diffusion exponent in the
case of anomalous diffusion. We test all these predictions by means of
numerical simulations.

large fraction of stars formed in clusters hosting massive stars. OB stars have
an important feedback on the evolution of protoplanetary disks around nearby
young stars and likely on the process of planet formation occurring in them.
The nearby massive association Cygnus OB2 is an outstanding laboratory to study
this feedback. It is the closest massive association to our Sun, and hosts
hundreds of massive stars and thousands of low mass members. In this paper, we
analyze the spatial variation of the disk fraction in Cygnus OB2 and we study
its correlation with the local values of Far and Extreme ultraviolet radiation
fields and the local stellar surface density. We present definitive evidence
that disks are more rapidly dissipated in the regions of the association
characterized by intense local UV field and large stellar density. In
particular, the FUV radiation dominates disks dissipation timescales in the
proximity (i.e. within 0.5 pc) of the O stars. In the rest of the association,
EUV photons potentially induce a significant mass loss from the irradiated
disks across the entire association, but the efficiency of this process is
reduced at increasing distances from the massive stars due to absorption by the
intervening intracluster material. We find that disk dissipation due to close
stellar encounters is negligible in Cygnus OB2, and likely to have affected 1%
or fewer of the stellar population. Disk dissipation is instead dominated by
photoevaporation. We also compare our results to what has been found in other
young clusters with different massive populations, concluding that massive
associations like Cygnus OB2 are potentially hostile to protoplanetary disks,
but that the environments where disks can safely evolve in planetary systems
are likely quite common in our Galaxy.

uncertainties is a challenge. It involves solving a stochastic control problem
modeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) in a general
framework. For a convex environment, we propose an optimization-based open-loop
optimal control problem coupled with receding horizon control strategy to plan
for high quality trajectories along which the uncertainty of the state
localization is reduced while the system reaches to a goal state with minimum
control effort. In a static environment with non-convex state constraints, the
optimization is modified by defining barrier functions to obtain collision-free
paths while maintaining the previous goals. By initializing the optimization
with trajectories in different homotopy classes and comparing the resultant
costs, we improve the quality of the solution in the presence of action and
measurement uncertainties. In dynamic environments with time-varying
constraints such as moving obstacles or banned areas, the approach is extended
to find collision-free trajectories. In this paper, the underlying spaces are
continuous, and beliefs are non-Gaussian. Without obstacles, the optimization
is a globally convex problem, while in the presence of obstacles it becomes
locally convex. We demonstrate the performance of the method on different
scenarios.

  equations with nonnegative density",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the
nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Local strong solutions
are established, for any initial data $(\rho_0, u_0)\in (W^{1,\gamma} \cap
L^\infty)\times H_{0,\sigma}^1$, with $\gamma>1$, and if $\gamma\geq2$, then
the strong solution is unique. The initial density is allowed to be
nonnegative, and in particular, the initial vacuum is allowed. The assumption
on the initial data is weaker than the previous widely used one that $(\rho_0,
u_0)\in (H^1 \cap L^\infty )\times(H_{0,\sigma}^1 \cap H^2)$, and no
compatibility condition is required.

  interaction during aerial navigation","Manuscript as initially submitted to Journal of Neural Engineering in
  March, 2016",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective. We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a
fine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been
known to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high
performance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash; these failures are
termed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and
pupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within
a virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT
can be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the
electroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma
spectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma
band activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest
contribution, while theta band activity with a frontocentral topography has the
most robust contribution in terms of real world usability. We show that the
output of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We
also find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the
magnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the
decoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the
dysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to
similar control failures in other cases of tight man machine coupling where
gains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for
by the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological
decoding of workload buildup that targets the LC ACC circuit may positively
impact operator performance in such situations.

selected on the basis of (1) proximity (within approximately 15 Mpc), (2)
tightness of observational constraints on the time of core collapse that
defines the gravitational-wave search window, and (3) coincident operation of
at least two interferometers at the time of core collapse. We find no plausible
gravitational-wave candidates. We present the probability of detecting signals
from both astrophysically well-motivated and more speculative

experiments, the community will become concerned with determining if events
counted in a dark matter experiment are good dark matter candidates or
low-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. We investigate the feasibility
of using neutrino-electron scattering in a terrestrial detector medium as a
means to determine the flight direction of the original, low-energy solar
neutrino.Using leading-order weak interactions in the Standard Model and
constrains from energy and momentum conservation, we developed a simple
simulation that suggests that 68% of the time the ejected electron would be
within 0.99 radians of the incident neutrino's direction. This suggests that it
may be fruitful to pursue low-energy neutrino detection capability that can

moving targets in multiantenna SAR. As a high resolution radar imaging
modality, SAR detects and localizes non-moving targets accurately, giving it an
advantage over lower resolution GMTI radars. Moving target detection is more
challenging due to target smearing and masking by clutter. Space-time adaptive
processing (STAP) is often used to remove the stationary clutter and enhance
the moving targets. In this work, it is shown that the performance of STAP can
be improved by modeling the clutter covariance as a space vs. time Kronecker
product with low rank factors. Based on this model, a low-rank Kronecker
product covariance estimation algorithm is proposed, and a novel separable
clutter cancelation filter based on the Kronecker covariance estimate is
introduced. The proposed method provides orders of magnitude reduction in the
required number of training samples, as well as improved robustness to
corruption of the training data. Simulation results and experiments using the
Gotcha SAR GMTI challenge dataset are presented that confirm the advantages of
our approach relative to existing techniques.

solar pores present themselves as an intriguing phenomenon that is not
completely understood. We examine in this work a solar pore observed with
Hinode/SP using two state of the art techniques. The first one is the spatial
deconvolution of the spectropolarimetric data that allows removing the stray
light contamination induced by the spatial point spread function of the
telescope. The second one is the inversion of the Stokes profiles assuming
local thermodynamic equilibrium that let us to infer the atmospheric physical
parameters. After applying these techniques, we found that the spatial
deconvolution method does not introduce artefacts, even at the edges of the
magnetic structure, where large horizontal gradients are detected on the
atmospheric parameters. Moreover, we also describe the physical properties of
the magnetic structure at different heights finding that, in the inner part of
the solar pore, the temperature is lower than outside, the magnetic field
strength is larger than 2 kG and unipolar, and the LOS velocity is almost null.
At neighbouring pixels, we found low magnetic field strengths of same polarity
and strong downward motions that only occur at the low photosphere, below the
continuum optical depth $\log \tau=-1$. Finally, we studied the spatial
relation between different atmospheric parameters at different heights
corroborating the physical properties described before.

dynamic games and control theory problems. An important tool for such problems
when they involve geometric motion is the level set method. This was first used
for reachability problems. The cost of these algorithms, and, in fact, all PDE
numerical approximations is exponential in the space dimension and time.
  In this work we propose and test methods for solving a large class of the HJ
PDE relevant to optimal control problems without the use of grids or numerical
approximations. Rather we use the classical Hopf formulas for solving initial
value problems for HJ PDE. We have noticed that if the Hamiltonian is convex
and positively homogeneous of degree one that very fast methods exist to solve
the resulting optimization problem. This is very much related to fast methods
for solving problems in compressive sensing, based on $\ell_1$ optimization. We
seem to obtain methods which are polynomial in the dimension. Our algorithm is
very fast, requires very low memory and is totally parallelizable. We can
evaluate the solution and its gradient in very high dimensions at $10^{-4}$ to
$10^{-8}$ seconds per evaluation on a laptop.
  We carefully explain how to compute numerically the optimal control from the
numerical solution of the associated initial valued HJ-PDE for a class of
optimal control problems. We show that our algorithms compute all the
quantities we need to obtain easily the controller.

find that, in some circumstances, the QKD relative performance of Gaussian and

different chiralities and associated dynamics that occurred during 2014 April
18 -- 20. While two flux ropes of different helicity with parallel axial
magnetic fields can only undergo a bounce interaction when they are brought
together, the observations at the first glance show that the heated plasma is
moving from one filament channel to the other. The SDO/AIA 171 A observations
and the PFSS magnetic field extrapolation reveal the presence of fan-spine
magnetic configuration over the filament channels with a null point located
above them. Three different events of filament activations, partial eruptions,
and associated filament channel interactions have been observed. The activation
initiated in one filament channel seems to propagate along the neighbour
filament channel. We believe that the activation and partial eruption of the
filaments bring the field lines of flux ropes containing them closer to the
null point and trigger the magnetic reconnection between them and the fan-spine
magnetic configuration. As a result, the hot plasma moves along the outer spine
line toward the remote point. Utilizing the present observations, for the first
time we have discussed how two different-chirality filament channels can
interact and show interrelation.

rely on $l_1$-norm regularized variational methods. However, when applied to
the reconstruction of $\textit{sparse images}$, i.e., images where only a few
pixels are non-zero, simple $l_1$-norm-based methods ignore potential
correlations in the support between adjacent pixels. In a number of
applications, one is interested in images that are not only sparse, but also
have a support with smooth (or contiguous) boundaries. Existing algorithms that
take into account such a support structure mostly rely on non-convex methods
and---as a consequence---do not scale well to high-dimensional problems and/or
do not converge to global optima. In this paper, we explore the use of new
block $l_1$-norm regularizers, which enforce image sparsity while
simultaneously promoting smooth support structure. By exploiting the convexity
of our regularizers, we develop new computationally-efficient recovery
algorithms that guarantee global optimality. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
regularizers on a variety of imaging tasks including compressive image
recovery, image restoration, and robust PCA.

query an object is chosen with probability p > 1/2 and we ignore ""inconclusive""
queries. We study the number of queries needed to recover the labeling in its
entirety (the height), to recover at least one single element (the fillup
level), and to recover a randomly chosen element (the typical depth). This
problem exhibits several remarkable behaviors: the depth D_n converges in
probability but not almost surely and while it satisfies the central limit
theorem its local limit theorem doesn't hold; the height H_n and the fillup
level F_n exhibit phase transitions with respect to p in the second term. To
obtain these results, we take a unified approach via the analysis of the
external profile, defined at level k as the number of elements recovered by the
kth query. We first establish new precise asymptotic results for the average

where it grows polynomially with n. We then extend the external profile results

piecewise approximation to formulate fractional order differential equations as
difference equations that describe the same dynamical behaviour and are more
amenable to a dynamical systems analysis. Unfortunately, due to mistakes in the
fundamental papers, the difference equations formulated through this process do
not capture the dynamics of the fractional order equations. We show that the
correct application of this nonstandard piecewise approximation leads to a one
parameter family of fractional order differential equations that converges to
the original equation as the parameter tends to zero. A closed formed solution
exists for each member of this family and leads to the formulation of a
difference equation that is of increasing order as time steps are taken. Whilst
this does not lead to a simplified dynamical analysis it does lead to a
numerical method for solving the fractional order differential equation. The
method is shown to be equivalent to a quadrature based method, despite the fact
that it has not been derived from a quadrature. The method can be implemented
with non-uniform time steps. An example is provided showing that the difference

paper demonstrates that one of the broken-symmetry phases does not exist in a

tensor factorization or tensor-kernel machines do not work well because of the
lack of convex formulation for the optimization of CGRL models, the poor
scalability of the algorithms in handling combinatorial numbers of tuples,
and/or the non-transductive nature of the learning methods which limits their
ability to leverage unlabeled data in training. This paper proposes a novel
framework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enables
transductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a
scalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear
time complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. In our experiments
with a subset of DBLP publication records and an Enzyme multi-source dataset,
the proposed method successfully scaled to the large cross-graph inference
problem, and outperformed other representative approaches significantly.

proved by Frank and Lenzmann (Acta Math., 210 (2013)).
  We show the existence of a solution $S$ of (mBO) satisfying $\|S

Benjamin-Ono type equations by Kenig, Martel and Robbiano (Ann. Inst. H.

radio jet during low-luminosity, usually hard states, as Galactic black-hole
X-ray binaries do. When radio emission is bright, a hard power-law tail without
evidence for an exponential cutoff is observed in most systems. We have
developed a jet model that explains many spectral and timing properties of
black-hole binaries in the states where a jet is present. Our goal is to
investigate whether our jet model can reproduce the hard tail, with the correct
range of photon index and the absence of a high-energy cutoff, in neutron-star
X-ray binaries. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Compton
upscattering of soft, accretion-disk or boundary layer photons, in the jet and
computed the emergent energy spectra, as well as the time lag of hard photons
with respect to softer ones as a function of Fourier frequency. We demonstrate
that our jet model explains the observed power-law distribution with photon
index in the range 1.8-3. With an appropriate choice of the parameters, the
cutoff expected from Comptonization is shifted to energies above ~300 keV,
producing a pure power law without any evidence for a rollover, in agreement
with the observations. Our results reinforce the idea that the link between the
outflow (jet) and inflow (disk) in X-ray binaries does not depend on the nature
of the compact object, but on the process of accretion. Furthermore, we address
the differences of jets in black-hole and neutron-star X-ray binaries and
predict that the break frequency in the spectral energy distribution of
neutron-star X-ray binaries, as a class, will be lower than that of black-hole
binaries.

ensemble of interacting Bose condensed two-level atoms coupled with a cavity
field. Assuming the couplings between all atoms and the cavity field are
identical, the interplay between atom-atom interaction and detuning may lead to
a series of LZ transitions. Unlike the conventional sequential LZ transitions,
which are symmetric to the zero detuning, the LZ transitions of Bose condensed
atoms in a cavity field are asymmetric and sensitively depend on the photon
number distribution of the cavity. In LZ processes involving single excitation
numbers, both the variance of the relative atom number and the step slope of
the sequential population ladder are asymmetric, and the asymmetry become more
significant for smaller excitation numbers. Furthermore, in LZ processes
involving multiple excitation numbers, there may appear asymmetric population
ladders with decreasing step heights. During a dynamical LZ process, due to the
atom-cavity coupling, the cavity field shows dynamical collapse and revivals.
In comparison with the symmetric LZ transitions in a classical field, the
asymmetric LZ transitions in a cavity field originate from the
photon-number-dependent Rabi frequency. The asymmetric sequential LZ dynamics
of Bose condensed atoms in a cavity field may open up a new way to explore the
fundamental many-body physics in coupled atom-photon systems.

by only using the sign information of its linear measurements. To compensate
for the loss of scale information, past studies in the area have proposed
recovering the signal by imposing an additional constraint on the L2-norm of
the signal. Recently, an alternative strategy that captures scale information
by introducing a threshold parameter to the quantization process was advanced.
In this paper, we analyze the typical behavior of the thresholding 1-bit
compressed sensing utilizing the replica method of statistical mechanics, so as
to gain an insight for properly setting the threshold value. Our result shows
that, fixing the threshold at a constant value yields better performance than
varying it randomly when the constant is optimally tuned, statistically.
Unfortunately, the optimal threshold value depends on the statistical
properties of the target signal, which may not be known in advance. In order to
handle this inconvenience, we develop a heuristic that adaptively tunes the
threshold parameter based on the frequency of positive (or negative) values in
the binary outputs. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic exhibits
satisfactory performance while incurring low computational cost.

inevitably introduces the rotation as a symmetry-restoring collective motion
(Anderson-Nambu-Goldstone mode), and the rotation affects the intrinsic motion.
In order to investigate the interplay between the rotational and intrinsic
motions in a variety of collective phenomena, we use the cranking prescription
together with the quasiparticle random phase approximation. At low spin, the
coupling effect can be seen in the generalized intensity relation. A feasible
quantization of the cranking model is presented, which provides a microscopic
approach to the higher-order intensity relation. At high spin, the
semiclassical cranking prescription works well. We discuss properties of
collective vibrational motions under rapid rotation and/or large deformation.
The superdeformed shell structure plays a key role in emergence of a new soft
mode which could lead to instability toward the $K^\pi=1^-$ octupole shape. A
wobbling mode of excitation, which is a clear signature of the triviality, is
discussed in terms of a microscopic point of view. A crucial role played by the
quasiparticle alignment is presented.

However, nothing definitive is known about magnetic fields in ring galaxies.
Here we investigate large-scale magnetic fields in a previously unexplored
context, namely ring galaxies, and concentrate our efforts on the structures
that appear most promising for galactic dynamo action, i.e. outer star-forming
rings in visually unbarred galaxies. We use tested methods for modelling
$\alpha-\Omega$ galactic dynamos, taking into account the available
observational information concerning ionized interstellar matter in ring
galaxies. Our main result is that dynamo drivers in ring galaxies are strong
enough to excite large-scale magnetic fields in the ring galaxies studied. The
variety of dynamo driven magnetic configurations in ring galaxies obtained in
our modelling is much richer than that found in classical spiral galaxies. In
particular, various long-lived transients are possible. An especially
interesting case is that of NGC 4513 where the ring counter-rotates with
respect to the disc. Strong shear in the region between the disc and the ring
is associated with unusually strong dynamo drivers for the counter-rotators.
The effect of the strong drivers is found to be unexpectedly moderate. With
counter-rotation in the disc, a generic model shows that a steady mixed parity
magnetic configuration, unknown for classical spiral galaxies, may be excited,
although we do not specifically model NGC 4513. We deduce that ring galaxies
constitute a morphological class of galaxies in which identification of
large-scale magnetic fields from observations of polarized radio emission, as
well as dynamo modelling, may be possible. Such studies have the potential to
throw additional light on the physical nature of rings, their lifetimes and
evolution.

the position variance of the gas. We study this effect by solving the dynamical
equations for the Continuous Spontaneous Localizations (CSL) model, as well as
for its non-Markovian and dissipative extensions. The resulting bounds, with a
95% of confidence level, are beaten only by measurements of spontaneous X-ray
emission and by experiments with cantilever (in the latter case, only for rC >
10^(-7) m, where rC is one of the two collapse parameters of the CSL model). We
show that, contrary to the bounds given by X-ray measurements, non-Markovian
effects do not change the bounds, for any reasonable choice of a frequency
cutoff in the spectrum of the collapse noise. Therefore the bounds here
considered are more robust. We also show that dissipative effects are
unimportant for a large spectrum of temperatures of the noise, while for low
temperatures the excluded region in the parameter space is the more reduced,
the lower the temperature.

of a series of n-alkane molecules from ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) to undecane
(n-C$_{11}$H$_{24}$) in tensile deformation up to the point of bond rupture.
The results are further generalized to a single polyethylene (PE) chain. Force,
true Cauchy stress, true virial stress, and Young's moduli were calculated as a
function of true strain for all of the molecules. In calculating the stress of
a single molecule, three methods (designated in this work as M1, M2, and M3)
are suggested based on three different metrics to quantify both the
instantaneous molecular cross-sectional area and volume during deformation. The
predictions of these methods are compared to theoretical, first-principles, and
experimental data. M1 gives true Cauchy and true virial stress results that are
essentially equivalent, suggesting that it is a better method for calculating
stress in alkane molecules and, hence, PE single chain. The MEAM predictions of
the average elastic modulus for a single PE chain using M1, M2, and M3 are 401
GPa, 172 GPa, and 147 GPa, respectively. Though these results are disparate, M1
gives a modulus value that is strikingly close to the ab initio-calculated
value of 405 GPa for the -CH$_2$CH$_2$- repeat unit of PE at 0 K. To further
test the MEAM potential, the Young's modulus (C$_{33}$ elastic constant) of an

jets emitting from a pair of highly boosted scalars. Following the discussion
of detecting the photon jets at the collider, we extend the two-Higgs-doublet
model (2HDM) by adding a gauge singlet scalar. To explain the di-photon excess
which is recently observed at the first 13 TeV run of the LHC, the mixing
between the heavy doublet state and the newly added singlet is crucially
needed. After the mixing, one can have a heavy Higgs state $Y_2$ at 750 GeV and
a very singlet-like scalar $Y_1$ of sub-GeV, which would be highly boosted
through the $Y_2$ decay. Both real singlet and complex singlet extension are
studied. It turns out that only the complex model can yield the 1-10 fb cross
section in the di-photon final state in accompany with the decay length of the
order of 1 m for the $Y_1$. This complex model parametrically predicts the
width of 750 GeV resonance $\gtrsim 1$ GeV. In addition, the pseudoscalar
component of the singlet in this model is naturally stable and hence could be a
dark matter candidate.

magneto-optical susceptibility on the order of V(540nm)~10^4 rad/(T*m) in the
helimagnetic phase and a maximum Faraday rotation of ~165deg/mm in the
ferrimagnetic phase. The large value of V can be explained by considering spin
cluster formation and the relative ease of domain reorientation in this

in distributed computing. This paper presents a distributed algorithm, called
\STT, for electing deterministically a leader in an arbitrary network, assuming
processors have unique identifiers of size $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number
of processors. It elects a leader in $O(D +\log n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the
diameter of the network, with messages of size $O(1)$. Thus it has a bit round
complexity of $O(D +\log n)$. This substantially improves upon the best known
algorithm whose bit round complexity is $O(D\log n)$. In fact, using the lower
bound by Kutten et al. (2015) and a result of Dinitz and Solomon (2007), we
show that the bit round complexity of \STT is optimal (up to a constant
factor), which is a significant step forward in understanding the interplay
between time and message optimality for the election problem. Our algorithm
requires no knowledge on the graph such as $n$ or $D$, and the pipelining
technique we introduce to break the $O(D\log n)$ barrier is general.

representation of scalar Green's function and without taking into account the
polarization effects. The radar equation obtained is the sum of several terms
corresponding to the propagation and scattering over the different kinds of
trajectories, depending on their smoothness and the possibility of reflection
from the ionosphere. It is shown that the monostatic sounding in the media with
significant refraction, unlike the case of refraction-free media, should be
analyzed as a combination of monostatic and bistatic scattering. This leads to
strong dependence of scattering amplitude on background ionospheric density due
to focusing mechanism and appearance of new (bistatic) areas of effective
scattering with significant distortion of the scattered signal spectrum.
Selective properties of the scattering also have been demonstrated.

the electric charge fluctuation is largely enhanced especially at high baryon

of stars and condensation temperature (known as Tc trend). Very recently, a
strong Tc trend was reported for the $\zeta$ Reticuli binary system, which
consists of two solar analogs. The observed trend in $\zeta^2$ Ret relative to
its companion was explained by the presence of a debris disk around $\zeta^2$
Ret. Our goal is to re-evaluate the presence and variability of the Tc trend in
the $\zeta$ Reticuli system and to understand the impact of the presence of the
debris disk on a star. We used very high-quality spectra of the two stars
retrieved from the HARPS archive to derive very precise stellar parameters and
chemical abundances. We derived the stellar parameters with the classical
(nondifferential) method, while we applied a differential line-by-line analysis
to achieve the highest possible precision in abundances, which are fundamental
to explore for very tiny differences in the abundances between the stars. We
confirm that the abundance difference between $\zeta^2$ Ret and $\zeta^1$ Ret
shows a significant ($\sim$ 2 $\sigma$) correlation with Tc. However, we also
find that the Tc trends depend on the individual spectrum used (even if always
of very high quality). In particular, we find significant but varying
differences in the abundances of the same star from different individual
high-quality spectra. Our results for the $\zeta$ Reticuli system show, for
example, that nonphysical factors, such as the quality of spectra employed and
errors that are not accounted for, can be at the root of the Tc trends for the
case of individual spectra.

  solutions and absence of gradient blow-up",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims at providing a first step toward a qualitative theory for a
new class of chemotaxis models derived from the celebrated Keller-Segel system,
with the main novelty being that diffusion is nonlinear with flux delimiter
features. More precisely, as a prototypical representative of this class we
study radially symmetric solutions of the parabolic-elliptic system (see the
text).
  Under the initial condition $u|_{t=0}=u_0>0$ and no-flux boundary conditions
in balls $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\chi>0$ and
$\mu:=\frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int_\Omega u_0$.\abs
  The main results assert the existence of a unique classical solution,
extensible in time up to a maximal $T_{max} \in (0,\infty]$ which has the
property that $$\mbox{if} \quad T_{max}<\infty \quad \mbox{then}
\quad\limsup_{t\nearrow T_{max}} \|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}=\infty.
\qquad \qquad (\star)$$
  The proof therefore is mainly based on comparison methods, which firstly
relate pointwise lower and upper bounds for the spatial gradient $u_r$ to
$L^\infty$ bounds for $u$ and to {\em upper bounds} for $z:=\frac{u_t}{u}$;
secondly, another comparison argument involving nonlocal nonlinearities
provides an appropriate control of $z_+$ in terms of bounds for $u$ and
$|u_r|$, with suitably mild dependence on the latter.
  As a consequence of ($\star$) by means of suitable a priori estimates it is
moreover shown that the above solutions are global and bounded when either
$$n\ge 2 \ \mbox{ and } \chi<1, \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad n=1, \ \chi>0 \ \mbox{
and } m<m_c, $$ with $m_c:=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\chi^2-1}}$ if $\chi>1$ and
$m_c:=\infty$ if $\chi\le 1$. That these conditions are essentially optimal
will be shown in a forthcoming paper in which ($\star$) will be used to derive
complementary results on the occurrence of solutions blowing up in finite time
with respect to the norm of $u$ in $L^\infty(\Omega)$.

controlled by varying the time delay between two separate voltage signals
applied to the conductor and the interferometer, respectively. As a specific
application we consider measuring the entanglement entropy generated by
partitioning electrons on a quantum point contact. Our scheme is robust against
moderate environmental dephasing and can be realized thanks to recent advances

In mmWave communication, beamforming is considered as a key technology to

beamforming may be necessary even during initial access/cell search. Among the
proposed beamforming schemes for initial cell search, analog beamforming is a
power efficient approach but suffers from its inherent search delay during
initial access. In this work, we argue that analog beamforming can still be a
viable choice when context information about mmWave base stations (BS) is
available at the mobile station (MS). We then study how the performance of
analog beamforming degrades in case of angular errors in the available context

effect of angular errors, showing that it can achieve the same performance as
hybrid beamforming.

quantum mechanics, we are able to show how the relevant Schr\""odinger equation
emerges naturally using the techniques of quantum field theory in curved

to well defined one particle Hilbert space. Time-dependent Lagrangians arise
naturally also in cosmology and give rise to the phenomenon of Hubble friction.

perfect assembly; i.e., given a set of reads from a long genome sequence, is it
possible to perfectly reconstruct the original sequence? In practice, however,
it is very often the case that the read data is not sufficiently rich to permit
unambiguous reconstruction of the original sequence. While a natural
generalization of the perfect assembly formulation to these cases would be to
consider a rate-distortion framework, partial assemblies are usually
represented in terms of an assembly graph, making the definition of a
distortion measure challenging. In this work, we introduce a distortion
function for assembly graphs that can be understood as the logarithm of the
number of Eulerian cycles in the assembly graph, each of which correspond to a
candidate assembly that could have generated the observed reads. We also
introduce an algorithm for the construction of an assembly graph and analyze
its performance on real genomes.

promised benefits. First, the network operator lacks tools to proactively
ensure that policies will be followed or to reactively inspect the behavior of
the network. Second, the distributed nature of state updates at the data plane
leads to inconsistent network behavior during reconfigurations. Third, the
large flow space makes the data plane susceptible to state exhaustion attacks.
  This paper presents SDNsec, an SDN security extension that provides
forwarding accountability for the SDN data plane. Forwarding rules are encoded
in the packet, ensuring consistent network behavior during reconfigurations and
limiting state exhaustion attacks due to table lookups. Symmetric-key
cryptography is used to protect the integrity of the forwarding rules and
enforce them at each switch. A complementary path validation mechanism allows
the controller to reactively examine the actual path taken by the packets.
Furthermore, we present mechanisms for secure link-failure recovery and

mass ~ 1.8 Msun). The cluster was observed in the context of the Gaia-ESO
Survey. The atmospheric parameters and Li abundances were derived using
high-resolution UVES spectra. The Li abundances were corrected for nonlocal
thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE) effects. Only upper limits of the Li
abundance could be determined for the majority of the sample. Two giants with
detected Li turned out to be Li rich: star MG 340 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.54 \pm
0.21 dex and star MG 591 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.60 \pm 0.21 dex. Star MG 340 is
on average ~ 0.30 dex more rich in Li than stars of similar temperature, while
for star MG 591 this difference is on average ~ 0.80 dex. Carbon and nitrogen
abundances indicate that all stars in the sample have completed the first
dredge-up. The Li abundances in this unique sample of 40 giants in one open
cluster clearly show that extra mixing is the norm in this mass range. Giants
with Li abundances in agreement with the predictions of standard models are the
exception. To explain the two Li-rich giants, we suggest that all events of
extra mixing have been inhibited. This includes rotation-induced mixing during
the main sequence and the extra mixing at the red giant branch luminosity bump.
Such inhibition has been suggested in the literature to occur because of fossil
magnetic fields in red giants that are descendants of main-sequence Ap-type
stars.

There has been a widening divergence and decoupling between wages on the one

capita climbed in sync (at least up to now). In the first part of the paper we
present comparative statistical evidence which measures the extent of the wage
transition effect. In a second part we consider the reasons of this phenomenon,
in particular we explain how the transfers of labor from low productivity
sectors (such as agriculture) to high productivity sectors (such as
manufacturing) are the driver of productivity growth, particularly through
their synergetic effects. Although rural flight represents only one of these
effects, it is certainly the most visible because of the geographical
relocation that it implies; it is also the most well-defined statistically.
Moreover, it will be seen that it is a good indicator of the overall
productivity and attractivity of the non-agricultural sector. Because this
model accounts fairly well for the observed evolution in industrialized
countries, we use it to predict the rate of Chinese economic growth in the
coming decades. Our forecast for the average annual growth of real wages ranges
from 4% to 6% depending on how well China will control the development of its

Since the
initial proposal of Nambu for the origin of the nucleon mass, the dynamical
symmetry breaking in the strongly coupled underlying theories has been
expanding the horizons in the context of the modern version of the origin of
mass beyond the Standard Model (SM). The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is a
typical strong coupling theory with the non-zero critical coupling, in sharp
contrast to its precedent model, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for the
superconductor. The non-zero critical coupling is also hidden in the
asymptotically free gauge theories including QCD and walking technicolor. As is
well known, the NJL model can be cast into the SM Higgs Lagrangian. We show
that the SM Higgs Lagrangian is simply rewritten into a form of the
(approximately) scale-invariant nonlinear sigma model, with both the chiral
symmetry and scale symmetry realized nonlinearly, with the SM Higgs being
nothing but the (pseudo-) dilaton. The SM Higgs Lagrangian is further gauge
equivalent to the scale-invariant Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian,
s-HLS, having spin 1 bosons hidden in the SM. As the simplest possible
underlying theory for the SM Higgs Lagrangian we first discuss the top quark
condensate (""top-mode SM""), where the top-mode dilaton is the 125 GeV Higgs. We
then discuss the walking technicolor having near infrared conformality, whose
effective theory is the s-HLS model precisely the same as the SM Higgs

motility machineries: the S-engine and A-engine. Moving M. xanthus cells can
organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies depending on
their nutritional status. To understand these two pattern formation processes
and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as cell
reversal, we analyze spatial self-organization in 3 strains: i) a mutant that
moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, ii) a
unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and
iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, reverses its
direction of movement. The mutant moving by the A-engine illustrates that
collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding
bacteria due to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need
of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant
reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are
present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the
study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces
the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while
it results into vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are
consistent with what is known from self-propelled rods which strongly suggests
that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions
is the pattern formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. In
addition, we learn that when cells reverse, as observed in the wild-type, cells
form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like
structure at high enough densities.

demonstrate the use of the Ca II H and K residual core flux as a proxy for the
stellar activity level throughout the transit. A moderate trend is found
between the pre-transit absorption signal in the 2013 data and the Ca II H
flux. This suggests that some of the 2013 pre-transit hydrogen absorption can
be attributed to varying stellar activity levels. A very weak correlation is
found between the Ca II H core flux and the Balmer line absorption in the 2015
transit, hinting at a smaller contribution from stellar activity compared to
the 2013 transit. We simulate how varying stellar activity levels can produce
changes in the Balmer line transmission spectra. These simulations show that
the strength of the 2013 and 2015 pre-transit signals can be reproduced by
stellar variability. If the pre-transit signature is attributed to
circumplanetary material, its evolution in time can be described by accretion
clumps spiraling towards the star, although this interpretation has serious
limitations. Further high-cadence monitoring at H-alpha is necessary to
distinguish between true absorption by transiting material and short-term

injected into the ISM in gaseous form. Yet, ultraviolet and X-ray observations
along many lines of sight in the ISM show that iron is severely depleted in the
gas phase compared to expected solar abundances. The missing iron, comprising
about 90% of the total, is believed to be locked up in interstellar dust. This
suggests that most of the missing iron must have precipitated from the ISM gas
by cold accretion onto preexisting silicate, carbon, or composite grains. Iron
is thus the only element that requires most of its growth to occur outside the
traditional stellar condensation sources. This is a robust statement that does
not depend on our evolving understanding of the dust destruction efficiency in
the ISM. Reconciling the physical, optical, and chemical properties of such
composite grains with their many observational manifestations is a major
challenge for understanding the nature and origin of interstellar dust.

- from a hydrodynamic point of view. We found that some fish species do not
have preferred orientation and they swarm in a random pattern mode, despite the
excess of energy consumed. Our analyses, which includes calculations of the
hydrodynamic forces between slender bodies, show that such a behaviour enhances
the transfer of hydrodynamic information, and thus enhances the survivability

optimisation that might be crucial for survival.

The latter is true even though large combinations of unperturbed states with

2001-2013, covering the onset of the global financial crisis of mid-2007. After
a careful data cleaning, we apply a quality check in the construction of the
network, introducing a parameter (the Quality Ratio) capable of trading off the
size of the sample (coverage) and the representativeness of the financial
statements (accuracy). We compute several basic network statistics and check,
with the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of

Japanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the
presence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of
banks into similar supranational practices. Finally, a Principal Component

communities' heterogeneity. Even using the most basic vector similarity
hypotheses on the composition of the financial statements, the signature of the

E_g(T)=E_g(0)-AT^4. The main reason is electron-phonon renormalization. The
physics behind the T^4-power law is more complex than has been realized.
Renormalization by intraband scattering requires a careful non-adiabatic
treatment in order to correctly include acoustic phonons and avoid divergences
from piezoacoustic phonon interactions. The result is an unexpected low T term
E_g(0)+A' T^p with positive coefficient A', and power p=4 for non-piezoelectric
materials, and power p=2 for piezoelectric materials. The acoustic phonons in
piezoelectric semiconductors generate a piezoelectric field, modifying the
electron-phonon coupling. However, at higher T, when thermal acoustic phonons
of energy hbar v_s q acquire energies comparable to the electronic intermediate
state (higher than the band-edge state by hbar^2 q^2 /2m*), the low q and
higher q intraband contributions to T^p rapidly cancel, giving little thermal
effect. But there is an additional T-dependence from interband effects of
acoustic phonons. This turns out to have power law T^4 for both
non-piezoelectric and piezoelectric semiconductors. This term can have either
sign, but usually reduces the size of gaps as T increases. It arises after
cancellation of the T^2 terms that appear separately in Debye-Waller and Fan
parts of the acoustic phonon interband renormalization. The cancellation occurs
because of the acoustic sum rule.

partitioned into $n$ sets, each of size $n$, then there is a partial rainbow
matching of size $n-1$. He proved that there is a partial rainbow matching of
size $n(1-\frac{D_n}{n!})$, where $D_n$ is the number of derangements of $[n]$.
This means that there is a partial rainbow matching of size about $(1-
\frac{1}{e})n$. Using a topological version of Hall's theorem we improve this
bound to $\frac{2}{3}n$.

at different polarizer rotations. Fundamentally, the SfP model assumes that
light is reflected either diffusely or specularly. However, this model is not
valid for many real-world surfaces exhibiting a mixture of diffuse and specular
properties. To address this challenge, previous methods have used a sequential
solution: first, use an existing algorithm to separate the scene into diffuse
and specular components, then apply the appropriate SfP model. In this paper,
we propose a new method that jointly uses viewpoint and polarization data to
holistically separate diffuse and specular components, recover refractive
index, and ultimately recover 3D shape. By involving the physics of
polarization in the separation process, we demonstrate competitive results with
a benchmark method, while recovering additional information (e.g. refractive
index).

distinguished limits and asymptotic solutions for the advection equation with a
general oscillating velocity field with the systematic use of the two-timing

  (i) the dimensionless advection equation contains two independent small
parameters, which represent the ratio of two characteristic time-scales and the
spatial amplitudes of oscillations; the scaling of the variables and parameters
contains Strouhal number;
  (ii) an infinite sequence of distinguished limits has been identified; this
sequence corresponds to the successive degenerations of a drift velocity;
  (iii) we have derived the averaged and oscillatory equations for the first
four distinguished limits; derivations are performed up to the forth orders in
small parameters;
  (v) we have shown, that each distinguish limit solution generates an infinite
number of parametric solutions; these solutions differ from each other by the
slow time-scale and the amplitude of prescribed velocity;
  (vi) we have discovered the inevitable appearance of pseudo-diffusion, which
appears as a Lie derivative of the averaged tensor of quadratic displacements;
we have clarified the meaning of pseudo-diffusion using a simple example;
  (vii) our main methodological result is the introduction of a logical order
into the area and classification of an infinite number of asymptotic solutions;
we hope that it can help to study the similar problems for more complex
systems;
  (viii) since in our calculations we do not employ any additional assumptions,
our study can be used as a test for the validity of the two-timing hypothesis;
  (ix) the averaged equations for five different types of oscillating velocity
fields have been considered as the examples of different drifts and
pseudo-diffusion.

fractional Bessel vortex beam experiences a spin torque. The axial and
transverse radiation spin torque components are evaluated in the dipole
approximation using the radiative correction of the electric field. Particular
emphasis is given on the polarization as well as changing the topological
charge and the beam's half-cone angle. When the beam order is zero, the axial
spin torque component vanishes. However, when the beam order becomes a real
positive number, the vortex beam induces left-handed (negative) axial spin
torque as the sphere shifts off-axially from the center of the beam. The
results show that a non-diffracting non-paraxial fractional Bessel vortex beam
is capable to induce a spin reversal of an absorptive Rayleigh sphere placed
arbitrarily in its path. Potential applications are yet to be explored in
particle manipulation, rotation in optical tweezers, optical tractor beams, the
design of optically-engineered metamaterials to name a few areas.

uniquely applies these to capture the early time period (actual pulse) and late
time period (reverberation and multiple arrivals). In total, 183 features are
produced for each air-gun sound. This toolkit was utilized on data retrieved
from a field deployment encompassing five marine autonomous recording units
during a 46-day seismic air-gun survey in Baffin Bay, Greenland. Using this
toolkit, a total of 147 million data points were identified from the Greenland
deployment recordings. The feasibility of extracting a large number of features
was then evaluated using two separate methods: a serial computer and a high
performance system. Results indicate that data extraction performance took an
estimated 216 hours for the serial system, and 18 hours for the high
performance computer. This paper provides an analytical description of the new
toolkit along with details for using it to identify relevant data.
