$B^-\to\Lambda\overline p$ decays, it is now possible to extract both tree and
penguin amplitudes of the charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays for the first
time. The extracted penguin-tree ratio agrees with the expectation. Using the
topological amplitude approach with the experimental results on $\overline B
{}^0\to p \overline{p}$ and $B^-\to\Lambda\bar p$ decay rates as input,
predictions on all other $\overline B_q\to {\cal B} \overline {\cal B}$, ${\cal
B} \overline {\cal D}$, ${\cal D} \overline {\cal B}$ and ${\cal D} \overline
{\cal D}$ decay rates, where ${\mathcal B}$ and ${\cal D}$ are the low lying
octet and decuplet baryons, respectively, are given. It is non-trivial that the
results do not violate any existing experimental upper limit. From the analysis
it is understandable that why $\overline B {}^0\to p \overline{p}$ and
$B^-\to\Lambda\bar p$ modes are the first two modes with experimental
evidences. Relations on rates are verified using the numerical results. We note
that the predicted $B^-\to p\overline{\Delta^{++}}$ rate is close to the
experimental bound, which has not been updated in the last ten years. Direct
$CP$ asymmetries of all $\overline B_q\to {\cal B} \overline {\cal B}$, ${\cal
B} \overline {\cal D}$, ${\cal D} \overline {\cal B}$ and ${\cal D} \overline
{\cal D}$ modes are explored. Relations on $CP$ asymmetries are examined using
the numerical results. The direct $CP$ asymmetry of $\overline B {}^0\to p
\overline{p}$ decay can be as large as $\pm 50\%$. The $CP$ asymmetries of
$\Delta S=-1$ pure penguin modes are constrained to be of few $\%$. These modes
are expected to be sensitive to New Physics contributions and are good
candidates to be added to the list of the tests of the Standard Model.

when it is subjected to a gravitomagnetic tidal field, even when this field is
idealized as time-independent. The dynamical response is characterized by
time-changing internal currents, and it was suspected to originate from
zero-frequency g-modes and r-modes driven by the tidal forces. In this paper we
provide additional insights into the phenomenon by examining the tidal response
of a rotating body within the framework of post-Newtonian gravity. This
approach allows us to develop an intuitive picture for the phenomenon, which
relies on the close analogy between post-Newtonian gravity and Maxwell's theory
of electromagnetism. In this picture, the coupling between the gravitomagnetic
tidal field and the body's rotational velocity is naturally expected to produce
an unbalanced Lorentz-like force within the body, and it is this force that is
responsible for the tidal currents. The simplicity of the fluid equations in
the post-Newtonian setting allows us to provide a complete description of the
zero-frequency modes and demonstrate their precise role in the establishment of
the tidal currents. We estimate the amplitude of these currents, and find that
for neutron-star binaries of relevance to LIGO, the scale of the velocity
perturbation is measured in kilometers per second when the rotation period is
comparable to 100 milliseconds. This estimate indicates that the tidal currents
may have a significant impact on the physics of neutron stars near merger.

Web technologies and the use of knowledge graphs for data integration,

Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge
graphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge
representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural
networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information
within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings
contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to
the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of
function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein
interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that
matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually
crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph,
and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge
bases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics. Availability

thanks to asteroseismic observations. Preliminary comparisons with rotating
stellar models indicate that an undetermined additional process for the
internal transport of angular momentum is required in addition to purely
hydrodynamic processes. Aims: We investigate how asteroseismic measurements of
red giants can help us characterize the additional transport mechanism.
Methods: We first determine the efficiency of the missing transport mechanism
for the low-mass red giant KIC 7341231 by computing rotating models that
include an additional viscosity corresponding to this process. We then discuss
the change in the efficiency of this transport of angular momentum with the
mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Results: In the case of the low-mass
red giant KIC 7341231, we find that the viscosity corresponding to the
additional mechanism is constrained to the range 1 x 10^3 - 1.3 x 10^4 cm^2/s.
This constraint on the efficiency of the unknown additional transport mechanism
during the post-main sequence is obtained independently of any specific
assumption about the modelling of rotational effects during the pre-main
sequence and the main sequence (in particular, the braking of the surface by
magnetized winds and the efficiency of the internal transport of angular
momentum before the post-main-sequence phase). When we assume that the
additional transport mechanism is at work during the whole evolution of the
star together with a solar-calibrated braking of the surface by magnetized
winds, the range of nu_add is reduced to 1 - 4 x 10^3 cm^2/s. In addition to
being sensitive to the evolutionary stage of the star, we show that the
efficiency of the unknown process for internal transport of angular momentum
increases with the stellar mass.

elements whose abundances can be determined in the UV to add to those in the
current literature. We also investigate the completeness of the VALD line list
in this region, and the adequacy of LTE modeling in the UV for this star. We
have used the LTE spectrum synthesis code {\sc zeeman} to model the UV spectrum
of $\iota$~Herculis for elements with 5 $\le$ Z $\le$ 80. Abundances or upper

  We find that most of our results are in reasonable agreement with previous

  LTE UV spectral synthesis is found to be a useful tool for abundance
determination, even though limitations such as incomplete and uncertain atomic
data, uncertain continuum normalization and scattered light, and severe
blending can introduce difficulties. The high abundance of two heavy elements
may be a sign of radiative levitation.

scalar-tensor theories that will be tested on cosmological scales over the
coming decade. In this work, we investigate the possibility of testing them in
the strong-field regime by looking at the properties of compact
objects-neutron, hyperon, and quark stars-embedded in an asymptotically de
Sitter space-time, for a specific subclass of theories. We extend previous
works to include slow rotation and find a relation between the dimensionless
moment of intertia, ($\bar{I}=Ic^2/G_{\rm N} M^3$), and the compactness,
$\cal{C}=G_{\rm N} M/Rc^2$ (an $\bar{I}$-$\cal{C}$ relation), independent of
the equation of state, that is reminiscent of but distinct from the general
relativity prediction. Several of our equations of state contain hyperons and
free quarks, allowing us to revisit the hyperon puzzle. We find that the
maximum mass of hyperon stars can be larger than $2M_\odot$ for small values of
the beyond Horndeski parameter, thus providing a resolution of the hyperon
puzzle based on modified gravity. Moreover, stable quark stars exist when
hyperonic stars are unstable, which means that the phase transition from
hyperon to quark stars is predicted just as in general relativity, albeit with
larger quark star masses. Two important and potentially observable consequences
of some of the theories we consider are the existence of neutron stars in a
range of masses significantly higher than in GR, and $\bar{I}$-$\mathcal{C}$
relations that differ from their GR counterparts. In the former case, we find
objects that, if observed, could not be accounted for in GR because they
violate the usual GR causality condition. We end by discussing several
difficult technical issues that remain to be addressed in order to reach more
realistic predictions that may be tested using gravitational wave searches or
neutron star observations.

drastically suppressed when the rate of creation of phonons (via pump-to-Stokes
conversion) is exactly balanced by the rate of phonon annihilation (via
pump-to-anti-Stokes conversion). This occurs when the phonon coherence waves
synchronized vibrations of a large population of molecules have identical
propagation constants for both processes, i.e., they are phase-velocity
matched. As recently demonstrated, hydrogen-filled photonic crystal fiber
pumped in the vicinity of its zero dispersion wavelength provides an ideal
system for observing this effect. Here we report that Raman gain suppression is
actually a universal feature of SRS in gas-filled hollow-core fibers, and that
it can strongly impair SRS even when the dephasing rate is high, particularly
at high pump powers when it is normally assumed that nonlinear processes become
more (not less) efficient. This counterintuitive result means that intermodal
stimulated Raman scattering (for example between LP01 and LP11 core modes)
begins to dominate at high power levels. The results reported have important
implications for fiber-based Raman shifters, amplifiers or frequency combs,
especially for operation in the ultraviolet, where the Raman gain is much

faculae or G-band bright points, appear in connection with small-scale magnetic
flux concentrations.
  Aims. Here we report on a new class of photospheric bright points that are
free of magnetic fields. So far, these are visible in numerical simulations
only. We explore conditions required for their observational detection.
  Methods. Numerical radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations of the
near-surface layers of the Sun were carried out. The magnetic field-free
simulations show tiny bright points, reminiscent of magnetic bright points,
only smaller. A simple toy model for these non-magnetic bright points (nMBPs)
was established that serves as a base for the development of an algorithm for
their automatic detection. Basic physical properties of 357 detected nMBPs were
extracted and statistically evaluated. We produced synthetic intensity maps
that mimic observations with various solar telescopes to obtain hints on their
detectability.
  Results. The nMBPs of the simulations show a mean bolometric intensity
contrast with respect to their intergranular surroundings of approximately 20%,
a size of 60-80 km, and the isosurface of optical depth unity is at their
location depressed by 80-100 km. They are caused by swirling downdrafts that
provide, by means of the centripetal force, the necessary pressure gradient for
the formation of a funnel of reduced mass density that reaches from the
subsurface layers into the photosphere. Similar, frequently occurring funnels
that do not reach into the photosphere, do not produce bright points.
  Conclusions. Non-magnetic bright points are the observable manifestation of
vertically extending vortices (vortex tubes) in the photosphere. The resolving
power of 4-m-class telescopes, such as the DKIST, is needed for an unambiguous
detection of them.

particles, which becomes available for further acceleration. We investigate the
subsequent first-order Fermi process sustained by small-scale magnetic
fluctuations with a Monte Carlo code. We find that the acceleration proceeds in
two distinct regimes: when the gyro-radius $r_{\textrm{g}}$ exceeds the
wavelength of the shear $\lambda$, the process is remarkably similar to
first-order Fermi acceleration at relativistic, parallel shocks. This regime
corresponds to a low density wind which allows the propagation of superluminal
waves. When $r_{\textrm{g}}<\lambda$, which corresponds to the scenario of
driven reconnection, the spectrum is softer.

analyzing materials properties and functions and achieving scientific

standard tools and exploitation of the scientific information requires new and
dedicated methodology based on approaches from statistical learning, compressed
sensing, and other recent methods from applied mathematics, computer science,
statistics, signal processing, and information science. In this paper, we
explain and demonstrate a compressed-sensing based methodology for feature
selection, specifically for discovering physical descriptors, i.e., physical
parameters that describe the material and its properties of interest, and
associated equations that explicitly and quantitatively describe those relevant
properties. As showcase application and proof of concept, we describe how to
build a physical model for the quantitative prediction of the crystal structure

  Reconstruction","12 pages",,,,"cs.DB cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Record linkage is the process of identifying records that refer to the same
entities from several databases. This process is challenging because commonly
no unique entity identifiers are available. Linkage therefore has to rely on
partially identifying attributes, such as names and addresses of people. Recent
years have seen the development of novel techniques for linking data from
diverse application areas, where a major focus has been on linking complex data
that contain records about different types of entities. Advanced approaches
that exploit both the similarities between record attributes as well as the
relationships between entities to identify clusters of matching records have
been developed.
  In this application paper we study the novel problem where rather than
different types of entities we have databases where the same entity can have
different roles, and where these roles change over time. We specifically
develop novel techniques for linking historical birth, death, marriage and
census records with the aim to reconstruct the population covered by these
records over a period of several decades. Our experimental evaluation on real
Scottish data shows that even with advanced linkage techniques that consider
group, relationship, and temporal aspects it is challenging to achieve high
quality linkage from such complex data.

days at a 1-minute cadence. The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric
dynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe
et al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present
the first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.
Beyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see
a star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which
consists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude ""nu_max""
and the mean frequency separation between mode overtones ""Delta nu"", is
surprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the
accepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the
asteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear
larger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is
caused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of
observations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10
muHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than
VIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we model ten overtones for degrees l=0,1,2. We
compare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON
velocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes
mostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few
peaks with lowest SNR.

suggestions that the AGN dust extinction law appreciably differs from that of

anomalous (i.e., their peak wavelengths and widths differ considerably from
that of the Galaxy). In this work, we explore the dust properties of 147 AGNs

which exhibit the 9.7 and 18 $\mu$m silicate emission features. We model their

Spitzer Space Telescope. We find that 60/93 of the observed spectra can be well
explained with ""astronomical silicate"", while the remaining sources favor
amorphous olivine or pyroxene. Most notably, all sources require the dust to be
$\mu$m-sized (with a typical size of ~1.5$\pm$0.1 $\mu$m), much larger than
sub-$\mu$m-sized Galactic interstellar grains, implying a flat or ""gray""
extinction law for AGNs. We also find that, while the 9.7 $\mu$m emission

high phase space density is required. A second tuning laser can be added

laser changes the inter-particle potential by inducing an AC stark effect. As a
result the required trapping density can be reduced down to $\rho \sim 10^6

revolutionary technologies from bioimaging to materials processing. In general,
the performance of these lasers is determined by the degree to which the pulses
of a particular resonator can be scaled in energy and pulse duration before
destabilizing. To date, milestones have come from the application of more
tolerant pulse solutions, drawing on nonlinear concepts like soliton formation
and self-similarity. Despite these advances, lasers have not reached the
predicted performance limits anticipated by these new solutions. In this
letter, towards resolving this discrepancy, we demonstrate that the route by
which the laser arrives at the solution presents a limit to performance which,
moreover, is reached before the solution itself becomes unstable. In contrast
to known self-starting limitations stemming from suboptimal saturable
absorption, we show that this limit persists even with an ideal saturable
absorber. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this limit can be completely
surmounted with an iteratively seeded technique for mode-locking. Iteratively
seeded mode-locking is numerically explored and compared to traditional static
seeding, initially achieving a five-fold increase in energy. This approach is
broadly applicable to mode-locked lasers and can be readily implemented into

  In this paper we develop a global regularity theory in the one-dimensional
setting, considering three prototypical sub-classes of actions. We prove global
regularity for \emph{bounded} $\phi$'s which otherwise are allowed to change

\emph{singular} actions associated with

Interestingly, the singularity of the fractional kernel $|x|^{-(n+\alpha)}$,
avoids an initial threshold restriction. Global regularity of the critical
endpoint $\alpha=1$ follows with double-exponential $W^{1,\infty}$-bounds.
Finally, for the other endpoint $\alpha=2$, we prove the global regularity of

These symmetries expose physically relevant degrees of freedom that, for

size to be reduced through a very structured selection of the basis states to
physically relevant subspaces. This can guide explorations of simple patterns
in nuclei and how they emerge from first principles, as well as extensions of
the theory beyond current limitations toward heavier nuclei and larger model
spaces. This is illustrated for the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell
model (SA-NCSM) and two significant underlying symmetries, the symplectic
Sp(3,R) group and its deformation-related SU(3) subgroup. We review the broad
scope of nuclei, where these symmetries have been found to play a key role:
from light to intermediate-mass nuclei, based on first-principle explorations;
through the Hoyle state in C-12, within a no-core shell-model perspective; up
to strongly deformed species of the rare-earth and actinide regions, as
investigated in earlier studies. A complementary picture, driven by symmetries
dual to Sp(3,R), is also discussed. We briefly review symmetry-guided
techniques that prove useful in various nuclear-theory models, such as Elliott
model, ab initio SA-NCSM, symplectic model, pseudo-SU(3) and pseudo-symplectic
models, ab initio hyperspherical harmonics method, ab initio lattice effective

states that for any sequence of vectors of $\ell_2$ norm at most $1/5$ and any
convex body $K$ of Gaussian measure $1/2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a
signed combination of these vectors which lands inside $K$. A major open
problem is to devise a constructive version of Banaszczyk's vector balancing
theorem, i.e. to find an efficient algorithm which constructs the signed
combination.
  We make progress towards this goal along several fronts. As our first
contribution, we show an equivalence between Banaszczyk's theorem and the
existence of $O(1)$-subgaussian distributions over signed combinations. For the
case of symmetric convex bodies, our equivalence implies the existence of a
universal signing algorithm (i.e. independent of the body), which simply
samples from the subgaussian sign distribution and checks to see if the
associated combination lands inside the body. For asymmetric convex bodies, we
provide a novel recentering procedure, which allows us to reduce to the case

  As our second main contribution, we show that the above framework can be
efficiently implemented when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$,
recovering Banaszczyk's results under this stronger assumption. More precisely,
we use random walk techniques to produce the required $O(1)$-subgaussian
signing distributions when the vectors have length $O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$, and
use a stochastic gradient ascent method to implement the recentering procedure
for asymmetric bodies.

the curvature effects appearing in the electronic properties of graphene. Two
physical situations are then considered: the weak curvature regime, with
$\left|R\right|<1/L^2$, and the strong curvature regime, with $1/L^2\ll
\left|R\right|<1/d^2$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature, $L$ is a typical size
of a sample of graphene and $d$ is a typical size of a local domain where the
curvature is pronounced. In the first scenario, we found that the curvature
transforms the conical nature of the dispersion relation due to a shift in the
momentum space of the Dirac cone. In the second scenario, the curvature in the
local domain affects the charge carriers in such a manner that bound states
emerge; these states are declared to be pseudo-Landau states because of the
analogy with the well known Landau problem; here the curvature emulates the
role of the magnetic field. Seeking more tangible curvature effects we
calculate e.g. the electronic internal energy and heat capacity of graphene in
the small curvature regime and give an expresssion for the ground state energy

van der Waals interactions within gold clusters are linearly correlated with
their radius of gyration and are weaker for planar clusters than for nonplanar

magnetohydrodynamic, phase-mixed, Gaussian Alfven pulses were investigated. In
the present work we extend this into kinetic regime. Here phase-mixed, Gaussian
Alfven pulses are studied, which are more appropriate for solar flares, than
harmonic waves, as the flares are impulsive in nature. Collisionless,
phase-mixed, dispersive, Gaussian Alfven pulse in transversely inhomogeneous
plasma is investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and by an
analytical model. The pulse is in inertial regime with plasma beta less than
electron-to-ion mass ratio and has a spatial width of 12 ion inertial length.
The linear analytical model predicts that the pulse amplitude decrease is
described by the linear Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation. The numerical and
analytical solution of the linear KdV equation produces the pulse amplitude
decrease in time as $t^{-1}$. The latter scaling law is corroborated by full
PIC simulations. It is shown that the pulse amplitude decrease is due to
dispersive effects, while electron acceleration is due to Landau damping of the
phase-mixed waves. The established amplitude decrease in time as $t^{-1}$ is
different from the MHD scaling of $t^{-3/2}$. This can be attributed to the
dispersive effects resulting in the different scaling compared to MHD, where
the resistive effects cause the damping, in turn, enhanced by the
inhomogeneity. Reducing background plasma temperature and increase in ion mass
yields more efficient particle acceleration.

microcavity device, occurring when the pump power is varied. We compare
experimental data to theoretical results and identify the underlying mechanism
to be based on the competition between the effective gain on the one hand and
the intermode kinetics on the other. When the pumping is ramped up, above a
threshold the mode with the largest effective gain starts to emit coherent
light, corresponding to lasing. In contrast, in the limit of strong pumping it
is the intermode kinetics that determines which mode acquires a large
occupation and shows coherent emission. We point out that this latter mechanism
is akin to the equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of massive bosons. Thus,
the mode switching in our microcavity device can be viewed as a minimal
instance of Bose-Einstein condensation of photons. We, moreover, show that the
switching from one cavity mode to the other occurs always via an intermediate
phase where both modes are emitting coherent light and that it is associated
with both superthermal intensity fluctuations and strong anticorrelations
between both modes.

this development, most of the key features of the design and the advantages

that they should adapt well to changes in unexpected situations. This paper
addresses the situation in which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable
parameters that govern its behavior, must optimize behavior with respect to an
objective function that is evaluated and learned through simulations. Bayesian
optimization with a Gaussian Process surrogate is used as the method for
investigating the objective function. One key benefit is that during
optimization, the Gaussian Process learns a global estimate of the true
objective function, with predicted outcomes and a statistical measure of
confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet. Having a model of the
objective function is important for being able to understand possible outcomes
in the decision space; for example this is crucial for training and providing
feedback to human pilots. However, standard Bayesian optimization does not
perform consistently or provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function
for highly volatile objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing
a novel sampling technique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This
technique gives the AI ability to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain
environment. More importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the
optimization, but also creates a better model of the entire objective surface.
With this improved model the agent is equipped to more accurately/efficiently
predict performance in unexplored scenarios.

in the case where it is the optically more dense medium. Optical analogues of
Yoneda peaks observed in the scattering of x-rays from metal surfaces are

  Systems Measurement and Control, 2016 April",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stabilization and trajectory control of a quadrotor carrying a suspended load
with a fixed known mass has been extensively studied in recent years. However,
the load mass is not always known beforehand or may vary during the practical
transportations. This mass uncertainty brings uncertain disturbances to the
quadrotor system, causing existing controllers to have worse stability and
trajectory tracking performance. To improve the quadrotor stability and
trajectory tracking capability in this situation, we fully investigate the
impacts of the uncertain load mass on the quadrotor. By comparing the
performances of three different controllers -- the proportional-derivative (PD)
controller, the sliding mode controller (SMC), and the model predictive
controller (MPC) -- stabilization rather than trajectory tracking error is
proved to be the main influence in the load mass uncertainty. A critical motion
mass exists for the quadrotor to maintain a desired transportation performance.
Moreover, simulation results verify that a controller with strong robustness
against disturbances is a good choice for practical applications.

evolution of a compressible, viscous self-gravitating (SG) Keplerian disc with
both horizontal thermal diffusion and a constant cooling timescale when an
axisymmetric structure is present and freely evolving. The calculation makes
use of the shearing sheet model and is carried out for a range of cooling
times. Although the solutions to the inviscid problem with no cooling or
diffusion are well known, it is non-trivial to predict the effect caused by the
introduction of cooling and of small diffusivities; this work focuses on
perturbations of intermediate wavelengths, therefore representing an extension
to the classical stability analysis on thermal and viscous instabilities. For
density wave modes the analysis can be simplified by means of a regular
perturbation analysis; considering both shear and thermal diffusivities, the
system is found to be overstable for intermediate and long wavelengths for
values of the Toomre parameter $Q \lesssim 2$; a non-SG instability is also
detected for wavelengths $\gtrsim 18H$, where $H$ is the disc scale height, as
long as $\gamma \lesssim 1.305$. The regular perturbation analysis does not
however hold for the entropy and potential vorticity slow modes as their ideal
growth rates are degenerate. To understand their evolution, equations for the
axisymmetric structure's amplitudes in these two quantities are analytically
derived and their instability regions obtained. The instability appears boosted
by increasing the value of the adiabatic index and of the Prandtl number, while
it is quenched by efficient cooling.

Despite attempts at the construction of `white-light cavities', the benefits

buildup -- have remained confined to narrow linewidths. Here, we demonstrate
achromatic optical transmission through a planar Fabry-Perot micro-cavity via
angularly multiplexed phase-matching that exploits a bio-inspired grating

transparent. The locus of a single-order 0.7-nm-wide resonance is de-slanted in
spectral-angular space to become a 60-nm-wide achromatic resonance spanning
multiple cavity free-spectral-ranges. This approach severs the link between the

present a revised model for mass transfer in a semi-detached binary system that
incorporates an extended atmosphere around the donor and allows for an
arbitrary mass ratio. We apply this new formalism to hypothetical, confirmed,
and candidate planetary systems to estimate mass loss rates and compare with
models of evaporative mass loss. Overflow may be significant for hot Neptunes
out to periods of $\sim$ 2 days, while for hot Jupiters, it may only be
important inward of 0.5 days. We find that CoRoT-24 b may be losing mass at a
rate of more than an Earth mass in a Gyr. The hot Jupiter WASP-12 b may lose an
Earth mass in a Myr, while the putative planet orbiting a T-Tauri star
PTFO8-8695 might shed its atmosphere in a few Myrs. We point out that the
orbital expansion that can accompany mass transfer may be less effective than
previously considered because the gas accreted by the host star removes some of
the system's angular momentum from the orbit, but simple scaling arguments
suggest that the Roche-lobe overflow might remain stable. Consequently, the
recently discovered small planets in ultra-short-periods ($<$ 1 day) may not be
the remnants of hot Jupiters/Neptunes. The new model presented here has been
incorporated into Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).

this limit, the operators creating microstates of the lowest mass black hole
are known exactly. We consider the time-ordered two-point function of light
probes in these microstates, normalized by the same two-point function in
vacuum. These correlators display a universal early-time decay followed by
late-time sporadic behavior. To find a prescription for temporal
coarse-graining of these late fluctuations we appeal to random matrix theory,
where we show that a progressive time-average smooths the spectral form factor
(a proxy for the 2-point function) in a typical draw of a random matrix. This
coarse-grained quantity reproduces the matrix ensemble average to a good
approximation. Employing this coarse-graining in the D1-D5 system, we find that

qualitative agreement with recent studies of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.

  mapping","20 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) is an important method for basic
and translational human neuroscience research. VLSM leverages modern
neuroimaging analysis techniques to build on the classic approach of examining
the relationship between location of brain damage and cognitive deficits.
Testing an association between deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel
involves very many individual tests and requires statistical correction for
multiple comparisons. Several strategies have been adapted from analysis of
functional neuroimaging data, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off
between avoiding false positives and statistical power (missing true effects).
Non-parametric, permutation-based methods are generally preferable because they
do not make assumptions that are likely to be violated by skewed distributions
of behavioral deficit (symptom) scores and by the necessary spatial contiguity
of stroke lesions. We used simulated and real deficit scores from a sample of
approximately 100 individuals with left hemisphere stroke to evaluate two such
permutation-based approaches. Using permutation to set a minimum cluster size
identified a region that systematically extended well beyond the true region,
even under the most conservative settings tested here, making it ill-suited to
identifying brain-behavior relationships. In contrast, generalizing the
standard permutation-based family-wise error correction approach provided a
principled way to balance false positives and false negatives. An
implementation of this continuous permutation-based FWER correction method is
available at https://gist.github.com/dmirman/05a92e0e9e0027f6fe6e528c648143d7

space, which provide sufficient conditions for mean-field behavior. These
conditions rely on a new notion of complexity for such measures, namely the
Gaussian-width of the gradient of the log-density. On the cube $\{-1,1\}^n$, we
show that a measure $\nu$ which exhibits low complexity can be written as a
mixture of measures $\{\nu_\theta\}_{\theta \in \mathcal{I}}$ such that: i. for
each $\theta$, the measure $\nu_\theta$ is a small perturbation of $\nu$ such
that $\log \tfrac{d \nu_\theta}{d \nu}$ is a linear function whose gradient is
small and, ii. $\nu_\theta$ is close to some product measure, in Wasserstein
distance, for most $\theta$. Thus, our framework can be used to study the
behavior of low-complexity measures beyond approximation of the partition
function, showing that those measures are roughly mixtures of product measures
whose entropy is close to that of the original measure. In particular, as a
corollary of our theorems, we derive a bound for the na\""ive mean-field
approximation of the log-partition function which improves the nonlinear large
deviation framework of Chatterjee and Dembo in several ways: 1. It does not
require any bounds on second derivatives. 2. The covering number is replaced by
the weaker notion of Gaussian-width 3. We obtain stronger asymptotics with
respect to the dimension. Two other corollaries are decomposition theorems for
exponential random graphs and large-degree Ising models. In the Gaussian case,
we show that measures of low-complexity exhibit an almost-tight reverse
Log-Sobolev inequality.

studied on the example of the Heisenberg model. It is shown that the Heisenberg

conditioned on higher-level representations. A representation discriminator is
introduced at each feature hierarchy to encourage the representation manifold
of the generator to align with that of the bottom-up discriminative network,
leveraging the powerful discriminative representations to guide the generative
model. In addition, we introduce a conditional loss that encourages the use of
conditional information from the layer above, and a novel entropy loss that
maximizes a variational lower bound on the conditional entropy of generator
outputs. We first train each stack independently, and then train the whole

represent all the variations, our SGAN decomposes variations into multiple

centralised policies, when multi-coverage is sufficient. For IRM traffic,
multi-LRU-One is preferable to multi-LRU-All, whereas when the traffic exhibits
temporal locality the -All variation can perform better. Both variations
outperform the simple LRU. When popularity knowledge is not accurate, the new
policies can perform better than centralised ones.

various compounds, and although these chemically distinct regions migrate and
mix during the disk lifetime, they can still leave an imprint on the
compositions of the forming planets. Observable atmospheric compositions of hot
Jupiters when compared against their host stars could potentially constrain
their formation and migration processes. We compared the measured planetary and
stellar abundances of carbon and oxygen for ten systems with hot Jupiters. If
the planets formed by core accretion with significant planetesimal accretion
and migrated through the disk, the hot Jupiter atmospheres should be
substantially super-stellar in O/H and sub-stellar in C/O. On the contrary,
however, we find that currently reported abundances of hot Jupiters have
generally super-stellar C/O ratios, though present uncertainties on the
reported O/H and C/O ratios are too large to reach a firm conclusion. In one
case however, HD 209458b, the elevated C/O and depleted O/H of the planet
compared to the host star is significant enough to suggest an origin far beyond
the ice line, with predominantly gas accretion, and subsequent disk-free
migration. Improved measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope will
enable more precise measurements for more hot Jupiters and we predict, based on
the current marginal trend, that a sizable fraction of hot Jupiters will show
enrichment of C/O and lower O/H than their hosts, similar to HD 209458b.

then be thought of as a ""subregion"" Penrose inequality in asymptotically

flows in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Combining the result with positivity

We simultaneously fit these observations, ground-based photometry from Pepper
et al. (2017), radial velocity data from Pepper et al. (2017), and an SED model
utilizing catalog magnitudes and the Hipparcos parallax to the system. The only
significant difference between our results and Pepper et al. (2017) is that we
find the orbital period is shorter by 37 seconds, $4.73610\pm0.00003$ vs.
$4.73653\pm0.00006$ days, and we measure a transit center time of BJD_TDB
$2457483.4310\pm0.0007$, which is 42 minutes earlier than predicted. Using our
new photometry, we measure the density of the star KELT-11 to 4%. By combining
the parallax and catalog magnitudes of the system, we are able to measure
KELT-11b's radius essentially empirically. Coupled with the stellar density,
this gives a parallactic mass and radius of $1.8\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $2.9\,{\rm
R}_\odot$, which are each approximately $1\,\sigma$ higher than the adopted
model-estimated mass and radius. If we conduct the same fit using the expected
parallax uncertainty from the final Gaia data release, this difference
increases to $4\,\sigma$. This demonstrates the role that precise Gaia
parallaxes, coupled with simultaneous photometric, RV, and SED fitting, can
play in determining stellar and planetary parameters. With high precision
photometry of transiting planets and high precision Gaia parallaxes, the
parallactic mass and radius uncertainties of stars become 1% and 3%,
respectively. TESS is expected to discover 60 to 80 systems where these
measurements will be possible. These parallactic mass and radius measurements
have uncertainties small enough that they may provide observational input into
the stellar models themselves.

M$_{\odot}$. This is in tension with gas masses derived via low-$J$ $^{12}$CO
and dust masses; bringing the estimates into accordance requires either (a) an
elevated CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor for our sample of $\alpha_{\rm CO} \sim
2.5$ and a gas-to-dust ratio $\sim200$, or (b) an high carbon abundance $X_{\rm

and molecular lines (including [CI], [CII], and multiple transitions of CO), we
use a modern Photodissociation Region code (3D-PDR) to assess the physical
conditions (including the density, UV radiation field strength, and gas
temperature) within the ISM of the DSFGs in our sample. We find that the ISM
within our DSFGs is characterised by dense gas permeated by strong UV fields.
We note that previous efforts to characterise PDR regions in DSFGs may have
significantly underestimated the density of the ISM. Combined, our analysis
suggests that the ISM of extreme dusty starbursts at high redshift consists of
dense, carbon-rich gas not directly comparable to the ISM of starbursts in the

determine the age of radio galaxies from their integrated spectrum; however,
many questions about their reliability remain unanswered. With various large
area surveys imminent (e.g. LOFAR, MeerKAT, MWA) and planning for the next
generation of radio interferometer well underway (e.g. ngVLA, SKA),
investigations of radio galaxy physics are set to shift away from studies of
individual sources to the population as a whole. Determining if and how
integrated models of spectral ageing can be applied in the era of big data is
therefore crucial. In this paper, I compare classical integrated models of
spectral ageing to recent well resolved studies that use modern analysis
techniques on small spatial scales to determine their robustness and validity
as a source selection method. I find that integrated models are unable to
recover key parameters and, even when known a priori, provide a poor, frequency
dependent description of a source's spectrum. I show a disparity of up to a
factor of 6 in age between the integrated and resolved methods but suggest,
even with these inconsistencies, such models still provide a potential method
of candidate selection in the search for remnant radio galaxies and in
providing a cleaner selection of high redshift radio galaxies in $z - {\alpha}$

We discovered X-ray (energies 0.2-1.4 keV) pulsations with a broad sinusoidal

an energy-dependent pulsed fraction varying from ~0.15 at 0.3 keV to ~0.6 at 1

total X-ray spectrum consists of a cool component (T ~ 0.96 x 10^6 K, hot-spot

unpulsed emission. The high-energy characteristics of PSR B1822-09 resemble
those of middle-aged pulsars such as PSR B0656+14, PSR B1055-52 and Geminga,

centrally concentrated on massive galaxies, M87, M86, and M84. The radial

confirmed IGCs shows a bimodality similar to that of M87 GCs. This indicates
that most IGCs are stripped off from dwarf galaxies and some from massive

large number of confirmed pulsars within the globular cluster Terzan 5 has
raised questions over its classification. Using the long-term radio pulsar
timing of 36 millisecond pulsars in the cluster core, we provide new
measurements of key physical properties of the system. As Terzan 5 is located
within the galactic bulge, stellar crowding and reddening make optical and near
infrared observations difficult. Pulsar accelerations, however, allow us to
study the intrinsic characteristics of the cluster independent of reddening and
stellar crowding and probe the mass density profile without needing to quantify
the mass to light ratio. Relating the spin and orbital periods of each pulsar
to the acceleration predicted by a King model, we find a core density of
$1.58\times$10$^6$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$, a core radius of 0.16 pc, a pulsar
density profile $n\propto r^{-3.14}$, and a total mass of M$_{\rm

formed via electron capture supernovae or exist in a core full of heavy white
dwarfs and hard binaries. Finally we provide an upper limit for the mass of a
possible black hole at the core of the cluster of 3.0$\times$10$^4$ M$_\odot$.

axially symmetric degenerate 2D electron systems where electron density
distribution $n(\vec r)$ behaves as $n(\vec r \to R)\to 0$ when $r$ approaches
the external radius $R$ of the domain occupied by electrons. It is shown that
finding the dependence of the spectrum of $ac$-modes on radial ($l$) and
azimuthal ($m$) indices when both $l$ and $m$ are small requires axially
symmetric solution of the relevant problem. The desires is achieved in the
so-called elliptic approximation for electron density distribution $n(\vec r)$.
The obtained results are employed to interpret available data on the excitation
of $ac$-modes in degenerate electron disks with smooth electron density profile
placed in the magnetic field $H$ normal to the disk plane. The performed
analysis confirms reported detection of the soft $ac$-mode in the range of $H

the eclipses seen in the optical light curve, confirming the high inclination
of the system. There is evidence of a periodicity between 17-22 min in the
X-ray and optical light curves of Lanning 386, which is associated with
quasi-periodic oscillations. This system also displays a hard X-ray spectrum
which is well fit by a partially covered, absorbed 2 temperature plasma. The
cool plasma temperature (0.24$^{+0.17}_{-0.08}$ keV) and hot plasma temperature
(9$^{+4}_{-2}$ keV) are not atypical plasma temperatures of known intermediate
polar systems. Based on this model, we suggest that Lanning 386 is an
intermediate polar with a high accretion rate. The hot plasma temperature
limits the white dwarf mass to $>$0.5 M$_{\odot}$. From the optical spectrum

supernovae rate of $\sim1.2$ yr$^{-1}$, the high HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio can be
explained by an enhanced HCN abundance as a result of mechanical heating by the
supernovae, though the active galactic nucleus and winds may also contribute
additional mechanical heating. The starburst size implies a high $\Sigma_{IR}$
of $4.7\times10^{12}$ $L_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$, slightly below predictions of
radiation-pressure limited starbursts. The HCN line profile has low-level

approaches aim to be scale-invariant, the cues for recognizing a 3px tall face

take a different approach and train separate detectors for different scales. To
maintain efficiency, detectors are trained in a multi-task fashion: they make
use of features extracted from multiple layers of single (deep) feature

crucial challenge remains training detectors for small objects. We show that
context is crucial, and define templates that make use of massively-large

the conjugacy classes in the T-duality group $O^+(\Gamma^{4,20})$ which
represent physically distinct symmetries. Subsequently, we make two conjectures
regarding the connection between the corresponding twining genera of $K3$ CFTs
and Conway and umbral moonshine, building upon earlier work on the relation
between moonshine and the $K3$ elliptic genus.

system that arises in the study of biological transport networks. The system
consists of a possibly singular elliptic equation for the scalar pressure of
the underlying biological network coupled to a diffusion equation for the
conductance vector of the network. There are several different types of
nonlinearities in the system. Of particular mathematical interest is a term
that is a polynomial function of solutions and their partial derivatives and
this polynomial function has degree three. That is, the system contains a cubic
nonlinearity. Only weak solutions to the system have been shown to exist. The
regularity theory for the system remains fundamentally incomplete. In
particular, it is not known whether or not weak solutions develop
singularities. In this paper we obtain a partial regularity theorem, which
gives an estimate for the parabolic Hausdorff dimension of the set of possible
singular points.

shear stress is often modeled using an effective viscosity that depends only on
the solid fraction. As the Reynolds number ($Re$) is increased and inertia
becomes important, the effective viscosity also depends on the Reynolds number
itself. The current experiments measure the torque for flows of
neutrally-buoyant particles in a coaxial-cylinder rheometer for solid
fractions, $\phi$, from 10\% to 50\% and Reynolds numbers based on particle
diameter from 2 to 1,000. For experiments for Reynolds of O(10) and solid
fractions less than $30\%$, the effective viscosity increases with Reynolds
number, in good agreement with recent numerical simulations found in the
literature. At higher solid fractions over the same range of $Re$, the results
show a decrease in torque with shear rate. For Reynolds numbers greater than
100 and lower solids concentrations, the effective viscosity continues to
increase with Reynolds number. However, based on comparisons with pure fluid
measurements the increase in the measured effective viscosity results from the
transition to turbulence. The particles augment the turbulence by increasing
the magnitude of the measured torques and causing the flow to transition at
lower Reynolds numbers. For the highest solid fractions, the measurements show
a significant increase in the magnitude of the torques, but the effective
viscosity is independent of Reynolds number.

We utilize biophysically relevant statistical data on FAS to damage the

Qualitatively, we demonstrate that damage leads to human-like mistakes. Our

amount of damage greatly depends on which connections are randomly injured,
providing intuition for why it is difficult to predict impairments. There is a

(async-parallel) iterative algorithms due to problems involving very
large-scale data and a large number of decision variables. Because of
asynchrony, the iterates are computed with outdated information, and the age of
the outdated information, which we call delay, is the number of times it has
been updated since its creation. Almost all recent works prove convergence
under the assumption of a finite maximum delay and set their stepsize
parameters accordingly. However, the maximum delay is practically unknown.
  This paper presents convergence analysis of an async-parallel method from a
probabilistic viewpoint, and it allows for large unbounded delays. An explicit
formula of stepsize that guarantees convergence is given depending on delays'
statistics. With $p+1$ identical processors, we empirically measured that

transverse to the U(1) compact one, and thus an additional SO(1,1) gauge

extra internal dimension, which will control the spontaneous symmetry
breakdown, and will allow us to establish a mass hierarchy. In this mechanism
there is no brane separation to be stabilized as in the braneworld paradigm,

duality relates the weak and strong self-interaction regimes of the theory, due

establish a flow for the electromagnetic coupling that mimics the

is simplified by lumping the bound energy states in groups. Different grouping
strategies are investigated, such as uniform and Maxwell-Boltzmann. The reduced
set of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is
obtained based on a moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across
a shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results show that adopting a
Maxwell-Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction
of the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas
and radiation quantities. It is observed that, when neglecting line radiation,
the use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the
photo-ionization precursor, internal relaxation and radiative cooling regions.
The inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to
account for optically thin losses in the alpha, beta and gamma lines of the
Balmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of

enhancement algorithms based on partial differential equations (PDEs). The
algorithms perform simultaneous smoothing and enhancement due to the
combination of both processes within the PDE-formulation. The framework enables
the incorporation of suitable colour and contrast enhancement algorithms within
one unified functional. Additional modification of the formulation includes the
combination of the popular Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
(CLAHE) with the proposed approach. This modification enables the hybrid
algorithm to provide both local enhancement (due to the CLAHE) and global
enhancement (due to the proposed contrast term). Additionally, the CLAHE clip
limit parameter is computed dynamically in each iteration and used to gauge the
amount of local enhancement performed by the CLAHE within the formulation. This
enables the algorithm to reduce or prevent the enhancement of noisy artifacts,
which if present, are also smoothed out by the anisotropic diffusion term
within the PDE formulation. In other words, the modified algorithm combines the
strength of the CLAHE, AD and the contrast term while minimizing their
weaknesses. Ultimately, the system is optimized using image data metrics for
automated enhancement and compromise between visual and quantitative results.
Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms perform a series of functions
such as illumination correction, colour enhancement correction and restoration,
contrast enhancement and noise suppression. Moreover, the proposed approaches
surpass most other conventional algorithms found in the literature.

complete, linearly-independent system of functions that spans a suitable
function space. The topic of this paper is the numerical approximation of
functions using the more general notion of frames: that is, complete systems
that are generally redundant but provide infinite representations with bounded
coefficients. While frames are well-known in image and signal processing,
coding theory and other areas of applied mathematics, their use in numerical
analysis is far less widespread. Yet, as we show via a series of examples,
frames are more flexible than bases, and can be constructed easily in a range
of problems where finding orthonormal bases with desirable properties (rapid
convergence, high resolution power, etc.) is difficult or impossible.
  A key concern when using frames is that computing a best approximation
requires solving an ill-conditioned linear system. Nonetheless, we construct a
frame approximation via regularization with bounded condition number (with
respect to perturbations in the data), and which approximates any function up
to an error of order $\sqrt{\epsilon}$, or even of order $\epsilon$ with
suitable modifications. Here $\epsilon$ is a threshold value that can be chosen
by the user. Crucially, rate of decay of the error down to this level is
determined by the existence of approximate representations of $f$ in the frame
possessing small-norm coefficients. We demonstrate the existence of such
representations in all of our examples. Overall, our analysis suggests that
frames are a natural generalization of bases in which to develop numerical
approximation. In particular, even in the presence of severely ill-conditioned
linear systems, the frame condition imposes sufficient mathematical structure

been interfaced to the web, which impedes the interests of the public. This
project aims to implement an ABA solver in a modern programming language that
performs reasonably well and interface it to the web for easier access by the
public. This project has demonstrated the novelty of development of an ABA
solver, that computes conflict-free, stable, admissible, grounded, ideal, and
complete semantics, in Python programming language which can be used via an
easy-to-use web interface for visualization of the argument and dispute trees.
Experiments were conducted to determine the project's best configurations and
to compare this project with proxdd, a state-of-the-art ABA solver, which has
no web interface and computes less number of semantics. From the results of the
experiments, this project's best configuration is achieved by utilizing
""pickle"" technique and tree caching technique. Using this project's best
configuration, this project achieved a lower average runtime compared to
proxdd. On other aspect, this project encountered more cases with exceptions
compared to proxdd, which might be caused by this project computing more
semantics and hence requires more resources to do so. Hence, it can be said
that this project run comparably well to the state-of-the-art ABA solver
proxdd. Future works of this project include computational complexity analysis
and efficiency analysis of algorithms implemented, implementation of more
semantics in argumentation framework, and usability testing of the web
interface.

MHT is capable of achieving slightly better or equal performance compared to

packages for Dense Linear Algebra (DLA). We implement MHT on a customized
platform for Dense Linear Algebra (DLA) and show that MHT achieves 1.3x better
performance than native implementation of classical HT on the same accelerator.
For custom realization of HT and MHT based QR factorization, we also identify
macro operations in the DAGs of HT and MHT that are realized on a
Reconfigurable Data-path (RDP). We also observe that due to re-arrangement in
the computations in MHT, custom realization of MHT is capable of achieving 12%
better performance improvement over multicore and GPGPUs than the performance
improvement reported by General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) over highly tuned

followed a heavy-tailed process, lacking the random component. Activity

\emph{partial-progress sharing} (PPS) -- whereby a researcher shares
information immediately upon making a breakthrough. This helps prevent
duplication of work; however there is evidence that existing reward structures
in research discourage partial-progress sharing. Ensuring PPS is especially
important for new online collaborative-research platforms, which involve many
researchers working on large, multi-stage problems.
  We study the problem of incentivizing information-sharing in research, under
a stylized model: non-identical agents work independently on subtasks of a
large project, with dependencies between subtasks captured via an acyclic
subtask-network. Each subtask carries a reward, given to the first agent who
publicly shares its solution. Agents can choose which subtasks to work on, and
more importantly, when to reveal solutions to completed subtasks. Under this
model, we uncover the strategic rationale behind certain anecdotal phenomena.
Moreover, for any acyclic subtask-network, and under a general model of
agent-subtask completion times, we give sufficient conditions that ensure PPS
is incentive-compatible for all agents.
  One surprising finding is that rewards which are approximately proportional
to perceived task-difficulties are sufficient to ensure PPS in all acyclic
subtask-networks. The fact that there is no tension between local fairness and
global information-sharing in multi-stage projects is encouraging, as it
suggests practical mechanisms for real-world settings. Finally, we show that
PPS is necessary, and in many cases, sufficient, to ensure a high rate of
progress in research.

ionization front (HIF) with photosphere and the radiation hydrodynamics of the
outer envelopes of Cepheids and RR Lyraes. For example, theoretical
calculations indicated that such interactions would occur at minimum light for
RR Lyrae and result in a flatter PC relation. In the past, the PC and AC
relations have been investigated by using either the $(V-R)_{MACHO}$ or $(V-I)$
colors. In this work, we extend previous work to other bands by analyzing the
RR Lyraes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 Region. Multi-epoch data is
available for RR Lyraes located within the footprint of the Stripe 82 Region in
five ($ugriz$) bands. We present the PC and AC relations at maximum and minimum
light in four colors: $(u-g)_0$, $(g-r)_0$, $(r-i)_0$ and $(i-z)_0$, after they
are corrected for extinction. We found that the PC and AC relations for this

quadratic relations. Furthermore, the PC relations at minimum light for
fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars are separated according to the Oosterhoff type,
especially in the $(g-r)_0$ and $(r-i)_0$ colors. If only considering the
results from linear regressions, our results are quantitatively consistent with

Boltzmann equation, however, it is very slow to converge in the near-continuum
flow regime. In this paper, a synthetic iterative scheme is developed to speed
up the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation. The velocity distribution
function is first solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is
corrected such that the macroscopic flow velocity is governed by a diffusion
equation which is asymptotic-preserving in the Navier-Stokes limit. The
efficiency of the new scheme is verified by calculating the eigenvalue of the
iteration, as well as solving for Poiseuille and thermal transpiration flows.
The synthetic iterative scheme is significantly faster than the conventional
iterative scheme in both the transition and the near-continuum flow regimes.
Moreover, due to the asymptotic-preserving properties, the SIS needs less
spatial resolution in the near-continuum flow regimes, which makes it even
faster than the conventional iterative scheme. Using this synthetic iterative
scheme, and the fast spectral approximation of the linearized Boltzmann
collision operator, Poiseuille and thermal transpiration flows between two
parallel plates, through channels of circular/rectangular cross sections, and
various porous media are calculated over the whole range of gas rarefaction.
Finally, the flow of a Ne-Ar gas mixture is solved based on the linearized
Boltzmann equation with the Lennard-Jones potential for the first time, and the
difference between these results and those using hard-sphere intermolecular
potential is discussed.

comprehensive particle-in-cell numerical investigation of reconnection in an

nonrelativistic ions, 0.001<<$\sigma_i$<<1) to the fully relativistic regime

rate is about 0.1 of the Alfvenic rate across all regimes; (2) electrons can
form concentrated moderately relativistic outflows even in the
semirelativistic, small-$\sigma_i$ regime; (3) while the released magnetic
energy is partitioned equally between electrons and ions in the
ultrarelativistic limit, the electron energy fraction declines gradually with
decreased $\sigma_i$ and asymptotes to about 0.25 in the semirelativistic
regime; (4) reconnection leads to efficient nonthermal electron acceleration
with a $\sigma_i$-dependent power-law index, $p(\sigma_i) \simeq $const$+0.7

calculating the ground state properties of a system within the density
functional theory. However, it is not widely used as its computational cost is
rather high and, also, some ambiguity remains in the theoretical framework. In
order to overcome these problems, we first introduced a method that accelerates
the OEP scheme in a static RPA-level correlation functional. Second, the
Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation is exploited to solve the OEP equation.
Although seemingly too crude, this approximation did not reduce the accuracy of
the description of the magnetic transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) examined
here, the magnetic properties of which are rather sensitive to correlation
effects. Finally, we reformulated the OEP method to render it applicable to the
direct RPA correlation functional and other, more precise, functionals.
Emphasis is placed on the following three points of the discussion: i)
Level-crossing at the Fermi surface is taken into account; ii) eigenvalue
variations in a Kohn-Sham functional are correctly treated; and iii) the
resultant OEP equation is different from those reported to date.

symmetric, classically chaotic systems coincide with those of random matrices
from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). Does this result hold for
two-dimensional Dirac material systems? To address this fundamen- tal question,
we investigate the spectral properties in a representative class of graphene
billiards with shapes of classically integrable circular-sector billiards.
Naively one may expect to observe Poisson statistics, which is indeed true for
energies close to the band edges where the quasiparticle obeys the
Schr\""odinger equation. However, for energies near the Dirac point, where the
quasiparticles behave like massless Dirac fermions, Pois- son statistics is
extremely rare in the sense that it emerges only under quite strict symmetry
constraints on the straight boundary parts of the sector. An arbitrarily small
amount of imperfection of the boundary results in GOE statistics. This implies
that, for circular sector confinements with arbitrary angle, the spectral
properties will generically be GOE. These results are corroborated by extensive
numerical computation. Furthermore, we provide a physical understanding for our
results.

entangled many-body quantum states with local density matrices maximally mixed.
Recently, the notion of perfect tensors recently has attracted a lot of
attention in the fields of quantum information theory, condensed matter theory,
and quantum gravity. In this work, we introduce the concept of an invariant
perfect tensor (IPT), which is a $n$-valent tensor that is both invariant and
perfect. We discuss the existence and construction of IPT. For bivalent
tensors, the invariant perfect tensor is the unique singlet state for each
local dimension. The trivalent invariant perfect tensor also exists and is
uniquely given by Wigner's $3j$ symbol. However, we show that, surprisingly,
there does not exist four-valent invariant perfect tensors for any dimension.
On the contrary, when the dimension is large, almost all invariant tensors are
perfect asymptotically, which is a consequence of the phenomenon of

defined on a cubical lattice which, in contrast to a proper triangulation,
allows for non--trivial simplicity constraints. This mimics the construction of
spin foams for 4D gravity. For lattice gauge models based on a finite group we
use the algorithm to obtain phase diagrams, encoding the continuum limit of a
wide range of these models. We find phase transitions for various families of
models carrying non--trivial simplicity constraints.

  Equations","1 figure",,,,"math.ST q-fin.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kernel Estimation is one of the most widely used estimation methods in
non-parametric Statistics, having a wide-range of applications, including spot
volatility estimation of stochastic processes. The selection of bandwidth and
kernel function is of great importance, especially for the finite sample
settings commonly encountered in econometric applications. In the context of
spot volatility estimation, most of the proposed selection methods are either
largely heuristic or just formally stated without any feasible implementation.
In this work, an objective method of bandwidth and kernel selection is
proposed, under some mild conditions on the volatility, which not only cover
classical Brownian motion driven dynamics but also some processes driven by
long-memory fractional Brownian motions or other Gaussian processes. We
characterize the leading order terms of the Mean Squared Error, which are also
ratified by central limit theorems for the estimation error. As a byproduct, an
approximated optimal bandwidth is then obtained in closed form. This result
allows us to develop a feasible plug-in type bandwidth selection procedure, for
which, as a sub-problem, we propose a new estimator of the volatility of
volatility. The optimal selection of kernel function is also discussed. For
Brownian Motion type volatilities, the optimal kernel function is proved to be
the exponential kernel. For fractional Brownian motion type volatilities,
numerical results to compute the optimal kernel are devised and, for the
deterministic volatility case, explicit optimal kernel functions of different
orders are derived. Simulation studies further confirm the good performance of
the proposed methods.

SDP-based approaches usually have the complexity growing exponentially with
respect to the network size, which may not be suitable for large-scale OPF

non-convex subproblems. We then consider SDP convex relaxation on the
subproblems instead of the relaxation on the centralized formulation commonly
found in the literature. The formulation leads to new conditions of exact SDP
convex relaxation that generalize some existing results. Based on the

the proposed SDP algorithms is that the complexity only grows approximately
linearly with respect to the network size. Numerical studies further
demonstrate that the computational time of the proposed algorithms need

  The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem is a fundamental result in extremal

  Navier-Stokes equations: spectral analysis and computational results",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this paper is to create a fruitful bridge between the numerical
methods for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs) in fluid
dynamics and the (iterative) numerical methods for dealing with the resulting
large linear systems. Among the main objectives are the design of new efficient
iterative solvers and a rigorous analysis of their convergence speed. The link
we have in mind is either the structure or the hidden structure that the
involved coefficient matrices inherit, both from the continuous PDE and from
the approximation scheme: in turn, the resulting structure is used for deducing
spectral information, crucial for the conditioning and convergence analysis,
and for the design of more efficient solvers.
  As specific problem we consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
as numerical technique we consider a novel family of high order accurate
Discontinuous Galerkin methods on staggered meshes, and as tools we use the
theory of Toeplitz matrices generated by a function (in the most general block,
multi-level form) and the more recent theory of Generalized Locally Toeplitz
matrix-sequences. We arrive at a quite complete picture of the spectral
features of the underlying matrices and this information is employed for giving
a forecast of the convergence history of the conjugate gradient method,
together with a discussion on new more advanced techniques (involving
preconditioning, multigrid, multi-iterative solvers). Several numerical tests
are provided and critically illustrated in order to show the validity and the
potential of our analysis.

triangulating isolated CME signal from the three coronagraphs over a sliding
window of five hours, the most likely region through which CMEs pass at 5 solar
radii is identified. The centre and size of the region gives the most likely
direction of propagation and approximate angular extent. The Automated CME
Triangulation (ACT) method is tested extensively using a series of synthetic
CME images created using a wireframe flux rope density model, and on a sample
of real coronagraph data; including halo CMEs. The accuracy of the angular
difference between the detection and true input of the synthetic CMEs is 7.14
degrees, and remains acceptable for a broad range of CME positions relative to
the observer, the relative separation of the three observers and even through
the loss of one coronagraph. For real data, the method gives results that
compare well with the distribution of low coronal sources and results from
another instrument and technique made further from the Sun. The true three

using a Gaussian excitation and linear identification methods, it is difficult
to split the global dynamics over the individual blocks. This paper first
proposes a well-designed multisine excitation with pairwise coupled random
phases. Next, a modified best linear approximation is estimated on a shifted
frequency grid. It is shown that this procedure creates a shift of the input
dynamics with a known frequency offset, while the output dynamics do not shift.
The resulting transfer function, which has complex coefficients due to the
frequency shift, is estimated with a modified frequency domain estimation
method. The identified poles and zeros can be assigned to either the input or
output dynamics. Once this is done, it is shown in the literature that the
remaining initialization problem can be solved much easier than the original
one. The method is illustrated on experimental data obtained from the

convection zone (F5 and later), strong large--scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type
stars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type
stars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless,
flares have previously been detected in the Kepler lightcurves of 33 A-type
stars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here we present new and
detailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the
flare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33
A-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field-of-view (FOV)
reveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars
and 5 stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained
high-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our
targets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19
stars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries.
Furthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can
originate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of
H$\alpha$ emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or
magnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative
explanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars,
but find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type
stars.

in previous models of flocking, here the stochasticity arises intrinsically
from the interactions between agents, and its strength is dependent on the

paper, are best suited to test the effectiveness of these different techniques.
We consider the system WW Psa + TX Psa whose membership of the 25-Myr beta
Pictoris association has been well established by earlier works. We investigate
which age dating technique provides the best agreement between the age of the
system and that of the association. We have photometrically monitored WW Psa
and TX Psa and measured their rotation periods as P = 2.37d and P = 1.086d,
respectively. We have retrieved from the literature their Li equivalent widths
and measured their effective temperatures and luminosities. We investigate
whether the ages of these stars derived using three independent techniques are
consistent with the age of the beta Pictoris association. We find that the
rotation periods and the Li contents of both stars are consistent with the
distribution of other bona fide members of the cluster. On the contrary, the
isochronal fitting provides similar ages for both stars, but a factor of about
four younger than the quoted age of the association, or about 30% younger when
the effects of magnetic fields are included. We explore the origin of the
discrepant age inferred from isochronal fitting, including the possibilities
that either the two components may be unresolved binaries or that the basic
stellar parameters of both components are altered by enhanced magnetic
activity. The latter is found to be the more reasonable cause, suggesting that
age estimates based on the Li content is more reliable than isochronal fitting
for pre-main-sequence stars with pronounced magnetic activity.

separate trends from noisy time series when no satisfactory models exist to fit

of detrending parameters. Here, we present a simple multivariate detrending
method based on available nonlinear forecasting techniques. These are in turn
based on state space reconstruction for which a strong theoretical
justification exists for their use in non-parametric forecasting. The
detrending method presented here is conceptually similar to Schreiber's noise
reduction method using state space reconstruction. However, we show that
Schreiber's method contains a minor flaw that can be overcome with forecasting.
Furthermore, our detrending method contains a simple but nontrivial extension

time series generated from the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz equations,
the Hindmarsh-Rose model of neuronal spiking activity, and a univariate
real-life measles data set. It is demonstrated that detrending heuristics can

boson. Studying the Unruh effect, we show that the inside state of the black
hole for gluons and quarks can be represented by a maximally entangled two mode
squeezed state of inside and matter Hilbert spaces of black hole. Comparing the
Higgs boson production outside and inside the shell, we observe that at lower
mass, MBH<4 TeV, and at higher mass, MBH>9 TeV, the Higgs boson will not be
produced outside the shell of black hole. However this particle can be produced
inside the shell for 2.5 TeV<MBH<12.5 TeV. We find that the outside the shell
of black hole is able to produce a quark for 3 TeV<MBH<10 TeV and eventually
for MBH<3 TeV and MBH> 12.5 TeV the black hole can only emit massless gluons.
However, inside the shell of black hole is able to produce a quark for 2.5
TeV<MBH<14 TeV. We also find that the micro black hole can be a source for
Higgs production at LHC. Finally we calculate the effects of Higgs boson
radiation due to inside the shell and outside the shell of mini black holes on
hadronic cross section at LHC. We observe that as the order of perturbation
theory increases, this effect becomes systematically more effective because at
higher orders there exists more channels for Higgs production and their decay
of Higgs into massive quark-anti quarks in our calculation. At smaller mass,
MBH<2 TeV, the NNLO contribution is large while the cross sections at NLO and
at LO are rising and respectively exhibit a turn-over at moderate values of
black hole's mass.The peak moves from about 5 TeV to 2.5 TeV. It is concluded
that the processes of hadronization inside the event horizon of mini black

alleviating this limitation.
  First, using a sequence of examples, we show that for lazily evaluated
languages current type systems may force one to write a program in an unnatural
way; we in particular argue that in such languages the relationship between
polymorphic and existential types can be made more systematic by allowing to
pass back (part of) an existential result of a function call as an argument to
the the function call that produced that value.
  After presenting our extension to System-F we show how we can implement the
strict-state thread monad $\mathrm{ST}$ by using a returned existential type in
specialising the polymorphic function which returns that type. Currently this
monad is built-in into the runtime system of GHC and as such has become part of
the language.
  Our proposed language extension, i.e. the introduction of polymorphic
contexts, reverses the relationship between the context of a function call and
the called function with respect to where it is decided with which type to

poses within an Euclidean space of at most 12 dimensions depending on the
object's symmetries. This makes it possible to efficiently perform neighborhood

particularly useful since this parameter has strong impact on the evolutionary
path. The previous paper in this series presented photospheric abundances for
24 giants in S-type SySt enabling a first statistical analysis. Here we present
results for an additional sample of 13 giants. The aims are to improve
statistics of chemical composition involved in the evolution of SySt, to study
evolutionary status, mass transfer and to interpret this in terms of Galactic
populations. High-resolution, near-IR spectra are used, employing the spectrum
synthesis method in a classical approach, to obtain abundances of CNO and
elements around the iron peak (Fe, Ti, Ni). Low-resolution spectra in the
region around the Ca II triplet were used for spectral classification. The
metallicities obtained cover a wide range with a maximum around ~-0.2 dex. The
enrichment in the 14N isotope indicates that these giants have experienced the
first dredge-up. Relative O and Fe abundances indicate that most SySt belong to
the Galactic disc; however, in a few cases, the extended thick-disc/halo is
suggested. Difficult to explain, relatively high Ti abundances can indicate

received much attention after the successful fabrication of graphene and other
fascinating materials afterwards. While most previous work is devoted to the
conventional lead-device-lead setup with a finite size center area, this
project investigates real space transport properties of infinite and
semi-infinite 2D system under the framework of Non-equilibrium Green function.
The commonly used method of calculating the Green function by inverting a
matrix in the real space directly can be unstable in dealing with large systems
as sometimes it gives non-converging result. Not to mention that the
calculation error and time increase drastically with size of the system. By
transforming from the real space to momentum space, we managed to replace the
matrix inverting process by Brillouin Zone integral process which can be
greatly simplified by the application of contour integral. Combining this
methodology with Dyson equations, we are able to calculate transport properties
of semi-infinite graphene close to its zigzag boundary and its combination with
other material including s-wave superconductor. Interference pattern of
transmitted and reflected electrons, graphene lensing effects and difference
between Specular Andreev reflection and normal Andreev reflection are verified
through our calculation.

$n$ available sensor observations. The selected measurements should minimize a
certain error function assessing the error in estimating a certain $m$
dimensional parameter vector. The exhaustive search inspecting each of the
$n\choose k$ possible choices would require a very high computational
complexity and as such is not practical for large $n$ and $k$. Alternative
methods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main
drawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix
and 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix.
To overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $k$, $n$
and $m$ grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then
used to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are
commonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select
properly $k$ measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error
measures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists
in applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure.
The second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look
for a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The
greedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error
measures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions. We
present two potential applications where the proposed algorithms can be used,
namely antenna selection for uplink transmissions in large scale multi-user
systems and sensor selection for wireless sensor networks. Numerical results
are also presented and sustain the efficiency of the proposed blind methods in
reaching the performances of channel-aware algorithms.

hazardous regions in real images because the location and severity of these

from synthetic images are further validated by annotating hazardous regions in

isoperiodic model sequences have been computed by adopting a nonlinear
convective hydrodynamical code in order to reproduce the multi- filter light
and (when available) radial velocity curve amplitudes and morphological
details. The inferred individual distances provide an intrinsic mean value for
the SMC distance modulus of 19.01 mag and a standard deviation of 0.08 mag, in
agreement with the literature. Moreover the instrinsic masses and luminosities
of the best fitting model show that all these pulsators are brighter than the
canonical evolutionary Mass- Luminosity relation (MLR), suggesting a
significant efficiency of core overshooting and/or mass loss. Assuming that the
inferred deviation from the canonical MLR is only due to mass loss, we derive
the expected distribution of percentage mass loss as a function of both the
pulsation period and of the canonical stellar mass. Finally, a good agreement
is found between the predicted mean radii and current Period-Radius (PR)
relations in the SMC available in the literature. The results of this

of data storage and transmission. Low cost of these operations is often a high
priority in order to increase transmission speed and reduce power usage. This
requirement is crucial for battery-powered devices with limited resources, such

techniques are frequently too expensive. This problem is on the increase as
machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things are becoming a

security, cost and performance in lightweight cryptography. This article
discusses Asymmetric Numeral Systems -- an innovative approach to entropy
coding which can be used for compression with encryption. It provides
compression ratio comparable with arithmetic coding at similar speed as Huffman
coding, hence, this coding is starting to replace them in new compressors.
Additionally, by perturbing its coding tables, the Asymmetric Numeral System
makes it possible to simultaneously encrypt the encoded message at nearly no
additional cost. The article introduces this approach and analyzes its security
level. The basic application is reducing the number of rounds of some cipher
used on ANS-compressed data, or completely removing additional encryption layer

microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) that includes the interfacial area (IFA)
between the oil and water. We consider the continuity equations for water and
oil, a balance equation for the oil-water interface and advective-dispersive
transport equations for bacteria, nutrients and surfactants. Surfactants lower
the interfacial tension (IFT), which improves the oil recovery. Therefore, we
include in the model parameterizations of the IFT reduction and residual oil
saturation as a function of the surfactant concentration. We consider for the
first time in context of MEOR, the role of IFA in enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
The motivation to include the IFA in the model is to reduce the hysteresis in
the capillary pressure relationship, include the effects of observed bacteria
migration towards the oil-water interface and biological production of
surfactants at the oil-water interface. An efficient and robust linearization
scheme was implemented, in which we use an implicit scheme that considers a
linear approximation of the capillary pressure gradient, resulting in an
efficient and stable scheme. A comprehensive, 2D implementation based on
two-point flux approximation (TPFA) has been achieved. Illustrative numerical
simulations are presented. We give an explanation of the differences in the oil
recovery profiles obtained when we consider the IFA and MEOR effects. The model
can also be used to design new experiments in order to gain a better
understanding and optimization of MEOR.

shear field is transformed without regard for masked regions of sky. This
masking mixes power, and E-convergence and B-modes. To study the accuracy of
forward-modelling and full-sky power spectrum recovery we consider both
large-area survey geometries, and small-scale masking due to stars and a
checkerboard model for field-of-view gaps. The power spectrum for the
large-area survey geometry is sparsely-sampled and highly oscillatory, which
makes modelling problematic. Instead, we derive an overall calibration for
large-area mask bias using simulated fields. The effects of small-area star
masks can be accurately corrected for, while the checkerboard mask has
oscillatory and spiky behaviour which leads to percent biases. Apodisation of
the masked fields leads to increased biases and a loss of information. We find
that we can construct an unbiased forward-model of the raw PCls, and recover
the full-sky convergence power to within a few percent accuracy for both
Gaussian and lognormal-distributed shear fields. Propagating this through to
cosmological parameters using a Fisher-Matrix formalism, we find we can make
unbiased estimates of parameters for surveys up to 1,200 deg$^2$ with 30
galaxies per arcmin$^2$, beyond which the percent biases become larger than the
statistical accuracy. This implies a flat-sky PCl analysis is accurate for
current surveys but a Euclid-like survey will require higher accuracy.

determine the phase diagram of the model with the uniaxial single-ion

problem. The hygroscopic swelling of individual fibres and their interactions
within the fibrous network govern the macroscopic response. At this scale,
moisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This
work focuses on several aspects of this issue. A macroscopic phenomenological
hygro-mechanical model is first proposed, which aims at predicting moisture
induced out-of-plane deformations in paper sheets. The constitutive model is
based on the relation between these deformations and typical irreversible
phenomena associated to the history of paper manufacturing, i.e. the release of
dried-in strains. The model is used to describe bending induced by moisture
gradients through the thickness of the sheet as well as buckling due to
moisture variation in the presence of mechanical constraints. The results of
the model show that the anisotropic sheet-level hygro-expansion has a strong
influence on the instability phenomena. Moreover, a comparison with experiments
provides adequate semi-quantitative estimates. An additional step is made
towards the multi-scale understanding of paper hygro-mechanics. The fundamental
mechanisms governing the macroscopic moisture induced response are investigated
on the basis of the underlying fibrous network. To this aim, a meso-structural
model is developed which consists of a network of fibres randomly positioned in
a planar region according to an orientation probability density function. A
series of network simulations reveals that upon moisture content variations the
expansion of the inter-fibre bonding regions drives the overall deformation.
Particularly in the case of anisotropic fibre orientation, this explains the
origin of the macro-scale anisotropic hygro-expansion, which is essential for
the observed sheet-level instability phenomena.

aspect is the possibility to have s-wave SC near half filling as reported by
Bodensiek \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{110}, 146406 (2013)]. When
doping the system, we identify three regions which correspond to an AF metallic
phase with small Fermi surface at weak coupling, an AF metal with a different
Fermi surface topology at intermediate coupling, and a paramagnetic metal with
a large Fermi surface at strong coupling. The transition between these two AF
phases is found to be discontinuous at lower fillings, but turns to a
continuous one when approaching half-filling. In the quest for s-wave
superconductivity, only solutions are found which possess mean-field character.
No true superconducting solutions caused by correlation effects are found in
the s-wave channel. In contrast, we clearly identify robust d-wave pairing away
from half-filling. However, we show that only by treating antiferromagnetism
and superconductivity on equal footing artificial superconducting solutions at
half-filling can be avoided. Our VCA findings support scenarios previously
identified by variational Monte Carlo approaches and are a starting point for
future investigations with VCA and further approaches such as cluster-embedding

amount of energy produced per unit time. When the size of organisms increases,
the metabolic rate increases slower than organisms' mass. This effect is called
allometric scaling. It has important implications for the individual and
population organismal development. Here, we study the causes of this phenomenon
considering metabolic properties of unicellular organisms (Amoeba Proteus,
fission yeast S. pombe, E. coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus). We found that
the metabolic properties of unicellular organisms are defined by two primary
factors. One is the need to acquire nutrients through the surface in a common
nutritional environment, which forms the base part of 2/3 of an allometric
exponent. The other factor is a regular increase of nutrient influx per unit
surface, when organisms' mass increases. This is a manifestation of metabolic
advantage, which bigger organisms need to have in order to support their
metabolic requirements. On the other hand, this advantage cannot be too strong,
which could lead to destruction of species, organisms feed on or compete for
nutrients within the food chain. Accounting for this regular increase of
nutrient influx, we obtained allometric exponents and their range close to
experimental values. This supports an argument that the metabolic properties of
living organisms, and interspecific allometric scaling in particular, indeed,
are defined by nutrient acquisition through the surface and a regular increase
of nutrient influx per unit surface, in a way that preserves a dynamic balance
between populations within the food chain.

paper introduces the nonlinear chaotic processing (NCP) model, which contains
six basic nonlinear operations. Each operation is a general framework that can
use existing chaotic maps as seed maps to generate a huge number of new chaotic
maps. The proposed NCP model can be easily extended by introducing new
nonlinear operations or by arbitrarily combining existing ones. The properties
and chaotic behaviors of the NCP model are investigated. To show its
effectiveness and usability, as examples, we provide four new chaotic maps
generated by the NCP model and evaluate their chaotic performance using
Lyapunov exponent, Shannon entropy, correlation dimension and initial state
sensitivity. The experimental results show that these chaotic maps have more
complex chaotic behaviors than existing ones.

our best tool to study currently star-forming, dense molecular gas at
extragalactic distances. The optical depth of these lines is a key ingredient
to estimate the effective density required to excite emission. However,
constraints on this quantity are even scarcer in the literature than
measurements of the high density tracers themselves. Here, we combine new
observations of HCN, HCO+ and HNC(1-0) and their optically thin isotopologues
H13CN, H13CO+ and HN13C(1-0) to measure isotopologue line ratios. We use IRAM
30-m observations from the large program EMPIRE and new ALMA observations,
which together target 6 nearby star-forming galaxies. Using spectral stacking
techniques, we calculate or place strong upper limits on the HCN/H13CN,
HCO+/H13CO+ and HNC/HN13C line ratios in the inner parts of these galaxies.
Under simple assumptions, we use these to estimate the optical depths of
HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) to be \tau ~2-11 in the active, inner regions of our
targets. The critical densities are consequently lowered to values between
5-20$\times 10^5$, 1-3$\times 10^5$ and 9$\times 10^4$ cm-3 for HCN, HCO+ and
HNC, respectively. We study the impact of having different beam-filling
factors, $\eta$, on these estimates and find that the effective critical
densities decrease by a factor of $\frac{\eta_{12}}{\eta_{13}}\,\tau_{12}$. A
comparison to existing work in NGC 5194 and NGC 253 shows HCN/H13CN and
HCO+/H13CO+ ratios in agreement with our measurements within the uncertainties.
The same is true for studies in other environments such as the Galactic Centre

development of spin caloritronic devices. Here, we construct a spin-Seebeck
device by inserting a strongly correlated quantum dot (QD) between the metal
lead and magnetic insulator. Using the slave-particle approach and non-crossing
approximation, we find that the spin-Seebeck effect increases significantly
when the energy level of the QD locates near the Fermi level of the metal lead
due to the enhancement of spin flipping and occurrences of quantum resonance.
Since this can be easily realized by applying a gate voltage in experiments,
the spin-Seebeck device proposed here can also work as a thermovoltaic
transistor. Moreover, the optimal correlation strength and the energy level
position of the QD are discussed to maximize the spin-Seebeck current as
required for applications in controllable spin caloritronic devices.

steady-state voltage stability scanning of a simplified model of the Australian

the effect of certain molecules -- called inhibitors -- on the progression of

Here, we take the single enzyme perspective and rebuild the theory of enzymatic
inhibition from the bottom up. We find that accounting for multi-conformational
enzyme structure and intrinsic randomness cannot undermine the validity of
classical results in the case of competitive inhibition; but that it should
strongly change our view on the uncompetitive and mixed modes of inhibition.
There, stochastic fluctuations on the single-enzyme level could give rise to
inhibitor-activator duality -- a phenomenon in which, under some conditions,
the introduction of a molecule whose binding shuts down enzymatic catalysis
will counter intuitively work to facilitate product formation. We state -- in
terms of experimentally measurable quantities -- a mathematical condition for
the emergence of inhibitor-activator duality, and propose that it could explain
why certain molecules that act as inhibitors when substrate concentrations are
high elicit a non-monotonic dose response when substrate concentrations are
low. The fundamental and practical implications of our findings are thoroughly
