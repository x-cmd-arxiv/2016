described by a vector-spinor field {\psi}_{{\mu}{\alpha}}, whose number of
components is larger than its independent degrees of freedom (DOF). Thus the RS
equations contain nontrivial constraints to eliminate the redundant DOF.
Consequently the standard procedure adopted in realizing relativistic spin-1/2
quasi-particle is not capable of creating the RS fermion in condensed matter
systems. In this work, we propose a generic method to construct a Hamiltonian
which implicitly contains the RS constraints, thus includes the eigenstates and
energy dispersions being exactly the same as those of RS equations. By
implementing our 16X16 or 6X6 Hamiltonian, one can realize the 3 dimensional or
2 dimensional (2D) massive RS quasiparticles, respectively. In the
non-relativistic limit, the 2D 6X6 Hamiltonian can be reduced to two 3X3
Hamiltonians which describe the positive and negative energy parts
respectively. Due to the nontrivial constraints, this simplified 2D massive RS
quasiparticle has an exotic property: it has vanishing orbital magnetic moment
while its orbital magnetization is finite. Finally, we discuss the material
realization of RS quasiparticle. Our study provides an opportunity to realize
higher spin elementary fermions with constraints in condensed matter systems.

framework is more appropriate for interpreting the procedures at work in texts
from the early history of infinitesimal analysis? as well as the related
question: what is a logical theory that is close to something early modern
mathematicians could have used when studying infinite series and quadrature
problems? We argue that what has been routinely viewed from the viewpoint of
classical analysis as an example of an ""unrigorous"" practice, in fact finds
close procedural proxies in modern infinitesimal theories. We analyze a mix of
social and religious reasons that had led to the suppression of both the
religious order of Gregory's teacher degli Angeli, and Gregory's books at

the Sun a source of GeV neutrinos. IceCube is able to detect neutrinos with
energies >100 GeV while its low-energy infill array DeepCore extends this to
>10 GeV. This analysis uses data gathered in the austral winters between May
2011 and May 2014, corresponding to 532 days of livetime when the Sun, being
below the horizon, is a source of up-going neutrino events, easiest to
discriminate against the dominant background of atmospheric muons. The
sensitivity is a factor of two to four better than previous searches due to
additional statistics and improved analysis methods involving better background
rejection and reconstructions. The resultant upper limits on the spin-dependent
dark matter-proton scattering cross section reach down to $1.46\times10^{-5}$

given certain self-consistent approximations, leading to the shear diffusion
constant on an appropriately defined stretched horizon. In theories containing
a gauge field, some of the metric perturbations mix with some of the gauge
field perturbations and the above analysis is somewhat more complicated. We
find a similar near-horizon analysis can be obtained in terms of new field
variables involving a linear combination of the metric and the gauge field
perturbation resulting in a corresponding diffusion equation. Thereby as
before, for theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating exponents $z,
\theta$ satisfying $z<4-\theta$ in four bulk dimensions, our analysis here
results in a similar expression for the shear diffusion constant with power-law
scaling with temperature suggesting universal behaviour in relation to the
viscosity bound. For $z=4-\theta$, we find logarithmic behaviour.

algorithms. The eigenvector centrality robustly identifies the backbone of the
minimum spanning tree defined on the return networks as well as the primary

relatively large in size, defined with the metrics market capitalization,
revenue and number of employees, constitute the core of the return networks,
whereas the periphery is mostly populated by relatively smaller sectors.
Therefore, sector-level nominal return dynamics is anchored to the real size
effect, which ultimately shapes the optimal portfolios for risk management. Our
results are reasonably robust across 27 countries of varying degrees of

  evolution learns to improve evolvability on rugged fitness landscapes",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been hypothesized that one of the main reasons evolution has been able
to produce such impressive adaptations is because it has improved its own
ability to evolve -- ""the evolution of evolvability"". Rupert Riedl, for
example, an early pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, suggested that
the evolution of complex adaptations is facilitated by a developmental
organization that is itself shaped by past selection to facilitate evolutionary
innovation. However, selection for characteristics that enable future
innovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for
benefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits
that have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we
resolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution
of evolvability and learning systems. We use the conditions that enable simple
learning systems to generalize, i.e., to use past experience to improve
performance on previously unseen, future test cases, to demonstrate conditions
where natural selection can systematically favor developmental organizations
that benefit future evolvability. Using numerical simulations of evolution on
highly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved
gene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of
avoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our
findings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that ""mimic""
the organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term
selection and also facilitate future innovation. Importantly, the conditions
that enable the evolution of such surprising evolvability follow from the same
non-mysterious conditions that permit generalization in learning systems.

infinite-time steady state is factorized on microscopic lengths, a signature of
the emergence of localization. The stationary state also displays vanishing
energy current and strong uncorrelated spatial fluctuations of local
observables. On the other hand, at finite times, the transient shows a
crossover from ballistic to diffusive energy propagation. In this regime and a
Markovian limit, concentrating on current-generating initial states with a
temperature imbalance, we show that the energy current and density satisfy
simple dissipative hydrodynamic equations. We describe the space-time scales at

large scale structure (LSS) observables for both current and future galaxy
surveys. In this work, we concentrate on the SSC of cluster counts, also known
as sample variance, which is particularly useful for the self-calibration of
the cluster observable-mass relation; our approach can similarly be applied to
other observables, such as galaxy clustering and lensing shear. We first
examined the accuracy of two analytical approximations proposed in the
literature for the flat sky limit, finding that they are accurate at the 15%
and 30-35% level, respectively, for covariances of counts in the same redshift
bin. We then developed a harmonic expansion formalism that allows for the
prediction of SSC in an arbitrary survey mask geometry, such as large sky areas
of current and future surveys. We show analytically and numerically that this
formalism recovers the full sky and flat sky limits present in the literature.
We then present an efficient numerical implementation of the formalism, which
allows fast and easy runs of covariance predictions when the survey mask is
modified. We applied our method to a mask that is broadly similar to the Dark
Energy Survey footprint, finding a non-negligible negative cross-z covariance,
i.e. redshift bins are anti-correlated. We also examined the case of data
removal from holes due to, for example bright stars, quality cuts, or
systematic removals, and find that this does not have noticeable effects on the
structure of the SSC matrix, only rescaling its amplitude by the effective
survey area. These advances enable analytical covariances of LSS observables to
be computed for current and future galaxy surveys, which cover large areas of
the sky where the flat sky approximation fails.

that can transform two orthogonal states to two non-orthogonal states. Its
inverse process, i.e., the QUANSDAM process could realize an exponential QC
speedup in solving an unstructured search problem in the quantum-computing (QC)
speedup theory (X. Miao, arXiv:1105.3573 [quant-ph] (2011)). In this paper the
principle of how a UNIDYSLOCK process works is described on the basis of the QC
speedup theory. A UNIDYSLOCK process does not exist at all in pure quantum
mechanics. That it can change the quantum-state difference is original from the
fundamental interaction between the quantum physical laws (i.e., the unitary
quantum dynamics and the Hilbert-space symmetric structure) and the
mathematical-logical principle of the search problem. It is characteristic for
the QC speedup theory. Even if a usual quantum computational (Qc) process that
is reversible or unitary contained a UNIDYSLOCK (or QUANSDAM) process, the
contribution of the UNIDYSLOCK (or QUANSDAM) process to the QC speedup of the
usual Qc process would be secondary or negligible. Whether or not a UNIDYSLOCK
(or QUANSDAM) process can make an essential contribution to a QC speedup can
distinguish the QC speedup theory from any usual Qc theory. In the paper the QC
speedup mechanism of the HSSS quantum search process is also studied. The
search process is essentially different from a usual quantum search algorithm.
It works in both the usual Hilbert space and the math Hilbert space. Due to the
math Hilbert space a mathematical-parallel operation is characteristic for the
QC speedup theory, while a quantum-parallel operation is characteristic for the
usual Qc theory. The fundamental interaction mentioned above and the
fundamental quantum-computing resource play the main role in speeding up the
search process.

this wide range of low layer technologies. By abstracting the hardware, we
focus on object's features and not on its real characteristics. D-LITe aims to
give a universal access to object's internal processing and computational
power. A small virtual machine embedded in each object gives a universal view
of its functionalities. Each object's features are discovered and programmed
through the network, without any physical access. D-LITe comes with the SALT
language that describes the logical behaviour needed to include user's Objects
into an IoT application. This communication is based on REST architecture.
Gathering all these logical units into a global composition is our way to build
a services Choreography, in which each Object has its own task to achieve. This
paper presents also an analysis of the gain obtained when a Choreography is
used instead of the most common services.

photometric properties of 53 H-poor and 16 H-rich SLSN host galaxies out to
$z\sim4$. We model their spectral energy distributions to derive physical
properties, which we compare with other galaxy populations. At low redshift,
H-poor SLSNe are preferentially found in very blue, low-mass galaxies with high
average specific star-formation rates. As redshift increases, the host
population follows the general evolution of star-forming galaxies towards more
luminous galaxies. After accounting for secular evolution, we find evidence for
differential evolution in galaxy mass, but not in the $B$-band and the far UV
luminosity ($3\sigma$ confidence). Most remarkable is the scarcity of hosts
with stellar masses above $10^{10}~M_\odot$ for both classes of SLSNe. In the
case of H-poor SLSNe, we attribute this to a stifled production efficiency
above $\sim0.4$ solar metallicity. However, we argue that, in addition to low
metallicity, a short-lived stellar population is also required to regulate the
SLSN production. H-rich SLSNe are found in a very diverse population of
star-forming galaxies. Still, the scarcity of massive hosts suggests a stifled
production efficiency above $\sim0.8$ solar metallicity. The large dispersion
of the H-rich SLSNe host properties is in stark contrast to those of gamma-ray
burst, regular core-collapse SN, and H-poor SLSNe host galaxies. We propose
that multiple progenitor channels give rise to this sub-class.

turbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the
probability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's
characteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an
effective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which
conceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this
effective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical
equivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the
statistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics
beyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF
and non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale
effect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the
large-scale modes. This suggests an interesting way to measure effective terms
directly from simulation. By applying the Gram-Charlier expansion, we
demonstrate a different structure of these effective terms. This formalism is a
natural framework for discussing the evolution of statistical properties of
large-scale modes, and provides an alternative view for understanding the
relationship between general effective dynamics and standard perturbation
theory.

generalized Fermat variety $X$ defined by the multivariate polynomial of degree
$n$, $\phi(x,y,z)=f(x)+f(y)+f(z)$ in $\Bbb{P}^3(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2)$,
plays a crucial role in the study of almost perfect non-linear (APN) functions
and exceptional APN functions. Their structure depends fundamentally on the
Fermat varieties corresponding to the monomial functions of exceptional degrees
$n=2^k+1$ and $n=2^{2k}-2^k+1$ (Gold and Kasami-Welch numbers, respectively).
Very important results for these have been obtained by Janwa, McGuire and
Wilson in [12,13]. In this paper we study $X$ related to the Kasami-Welch
degree monomials and its decomposition into absolutely irreducible components.
We show that, in this decomposition, the components intersect transversally at
a singular point.
  This structural fact implies that the corresponding generalized Fermat
hypersurfaces, related to Kasami-Welch degree polynomial families, are
absolutely irreducible. In particular, we prove that if
$f(x)=x^{2^{2k}-2^k+1}+h(x)$, where ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 3{\pmod 4}$, then the
corresponding APN multivariate hypersurface is absolutely irreducible, and
hence $f(x)$ is not exceptional APN function. We also prove conditional result
in the case when ${\rm deg}(h)\equiv 5{\pmod 8}$. Since for odd degree $f(x)$,
the conjecture needs to be resolved only for the Gold degree and the
Kasami-Welch degree cases our results contribute substantially to the proof of
the conjecture on exceptional APN functions---in the hardest case: the
Kasami-Welch degree.

Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) in the Landau gauge. In the quark self-energy,
the combined gluon propagator and quark-gluon vertex is modeled by an effective
interaction (the so-called Maris-Tandy interaction), where the ultraviolet term
is neglected. This renders the loop integrand of the quark self-energy analytic
on the cut-plane -Pi < arg(x) < Pi of the square of the external momentum.
Exploiting the simplicity of the truncation, I study solutions of the quark
propagator in the domain x in [-5.1,0] GeV^2 X i[0,10.2] GeV^2. Because of a
complex conjugation symmetry, this region fully covers the parabolic
integration domain for Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSEs) for bound state masses
of up to 4.5 GeV. Employing a novel numerical technique that is based on highly
parallel computation on graphics processing units (GPUs), I extract more than
6500 poles in this region, which arise as the bare quark mass is varied over a
wide range of closely spaced values. The poles are grouped in 23 individual
'trajectories', that capture the movement of the poles in the complex region as
the bare mass is varied. The raw data of the pole locations and -residues is
provided as supplemental material, which can be used to parametrize solutions
of the complex quark propagator for a wide range of bare mass values and for
large bound state masses. This study is a first step towards an extension of

with the long-term goal of establishing a framework that allows for the
numerical extraction of the analytic properties of the quark propagator with a
truncation that extends beyond the rainbow by making adequate adjustments in

photoionization modeling, suggest that we can derive useful histories of
individual AGN; the minimum ionizing luminosity is always an underestimate and
subject to fine structure in the ionized material. These tests suggest that the
underestimation from the upper envelope of Q values is roughly constant for a
given object. These AGN show rapid drops and standstills; the common feature is
a rapid drop in the last 20,000 years before our view of the nucleus. E-folding
timescales are mostly thousands of years, with a few episodes as short as 400.
In the limit of largely obscured AGN, we find additional evidence for fading,
comparing lower limits from recombination balance and the maximum luminosities
derived from from infrared fluxes. We compare these long-term light curves to
simulations of AGN accretion; the strongest variations on these timespans are
seen in models with strong and local feedback. Gemini integral-field optical
spectroscopy shows a very limited role for outflows in these structures. While
rings and loops of emission are common, their kinematic structure shows some to
be in regular rotation. UGC 7342 exhibits local signatures of outflows <300

limited by the weak nonlinear responses from the conventional Kerr dielectric
media. Considering the giant nonlinear susceptibility of graphene, here we
develop a nonlinear scattering model under the mean field approximation and
study the bistable scattering in graphene-coated dielectric nanowires based on
the semi-analytical solutions. We find that the switching intensities of
bistable scattering can be smaller than 1MW/cm2 at the working frequency. To
further decrease the switching intensities, we show that the most important
factor that restricts the bistable scattering is the relaxation time of
graphene, rather than the chemical potential and the permittivity of the

graphene-based bistable scattering, but also provides a guidance to further

exhibit multistability. The stability of a desired steady regime (e.g., a
synchronized state) to large perturbations is critical in the operation of many
real-world networked dynamical systems such as ecosystems, power grids, the
human brain, etc. This necessitates the development of appropriate quantifiers
of stability of multiple stable states of such systems. Motivated by the
concept of basin stability (BS) (Menck et al., Nature Physics 9, 89 (2013)), we
propose here the general framework of \emph{multi-node basin stability} for
gauging global stability and robustness of networked dynamical systems in
response to non-local perturbations simultaneously affecting multiple nodes of
a system. The framework of multi-node BS provides an estimate of the critical
number of nodes which when simultaneously perturbed, significantly reduces the
capacity of the system to return to the desired stable state. Further, this
methodology can be applied to estimate the minimum number of nodes of the
network to be controlled or safeguarded from external perturbations to ensure
proper operation of the system. Multi-node BS can also be utilized for probing
the influence of spatially localised perturbations or targeted attacks to
specific parts of a network. We demonstrate the potential of multi-node BS in
assessing the stability of the synchronized state in a deterministic scale-free
network of R\""{o}ssler oscillators and a conceptual model of the power grid of
the United Kingdom with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics.

images with multiple overlapping articulated model organisms (such as worms or
larvae). We present a general approach that separates the two main challenges
associated with such data, individual object shape estimation and object groups
disentangling. At the core of the approach is a deep feed-forward singling-out
network (SON) that is trained to map each local patch to a vectorial descriptor
that is sensitive to the characteristics (e.g. shape) of a central object,
while being invariant to the variability of all other surrounding elements.
Given a SON, a local image patch can be matched to a gallery of isolated
elements using their SON-descriptors, thus producing a hypothesis about the
shape of the central element in that patch. The image-level optimization based
on integer programming can then pick a subset of the hypotheses to explain
(parse) the whole image and disentangle groups of organisms.
  While sharing many similarities with existing ""analysis-by-synthesis""
approaches, our method avoids the need for stochastic search in the
high-dimensional configuration space and numerous rendering operations at
test-time. We show that our approach can parse microscopy images of three
popular model organisms (the C.Elegans roundworms, the Drosophila larvae, and
the E.Coli bacteria) even under significant crowding and overlaps between
organisms. We speculate that the overall approach is applicable to a wider
class of image parsing problems concerned with crowded articulated objects, for
which rendering training images is possible.

GHZ based deterministic JRSP as an example, we utilize the technique of weak
measurement and its reversal to suppress the effect of the amplitude-damping
noise firstly. Our study shows that the fidelity of the output state can be
improved in the amplitude-damping noise. We also study the effect of weak
measurement and its reversal in other three types of noise usually encountered
in real-world, namely, the bit-flip, phase-flip (phase-damping) and
depolarizing noise. Our results show that the weak measurement has no effect
for suppressing the bit-flip and phase-flip (phase-damping) noise, while has
slight effect for suppressing the depolarizing noise. Our study is suitable for
JRSP and RSP, and will be helpful for improving the efficiency of multiparticle

expectations of multivariate data among several groups. As a test statistic, a
conventional (approximate) $t$-statistic is considered, and we determine its
rejection region using a common rejection limit. When there are unknown
correlations among test statistics, the multiplicity adjusted $p$-values are
dependent on the unknown correlations. They are usually replaced with their
estimates that are always consistent under any hypothesis. In this paper, we
propose the use of estimates, which are not necessarily consistent and are
referred to as spurious correlations, in order to improve statistical power.
Through simulation studies, we verify that the proposed method asymptotically
controls the family-wise error rate and clearly provides higher statistical
power than existing methods. In addition, the proposed and existing methods are
applied to a real multiple testing problem that compares quantitative traits
among groups of mice and the results are compared.

evidence a direct link between the lattice contribution to the oxygen vacancy

chemically reduced: The larger the resulting volume expansion, the more
favorable thermal excitations are to point defect formation. However, the
interplay between the vibrational vacancy entropy, or equivalently, chemical
expansion, and epitaxial strain is difficult to generalise as this can be
strongly influenced by underlying structural and magnetic transitions. In

to the sub-village level. Up to 37% of alleles were partitioned between
populations and significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium was observed
indicating substantial inbreeding. High levels of haplotype relatedness around
households and within a range of 300m are consistent with a focal and clustered
infections suggesting that restricted local transmission occurs within the
range of vector movement and that subsequent focal inbreeding may be a key
factor contributing to the observed population structure. We conclude that
unique transmission strategies, including relapse allows P. vivax populations
to withstand pressure from control efforts for longer than P. falciparum.
However sustained control efforts do eventually impact parasite population
structure and with further control pressure, populations may eventually
fragment into clustered foci that could be targeted for elimination.

Specifically, we quantize the weights to zero or powers of two by minimizing
the Euclidean distance between full-precision weights and quantized weights
during backpropagation. We characterize the combinatorial nature of the low
bit-width quantization problem. For 2-bit (ternary) CNNs, the quantization of
$N$ weights can be done by an exact formula in $O(N\log N)$ complexity. When
the bit-width is three and above, we further propose a semi-analytical

computationally inexpensive. The free parameter is further determined by
network retraining and object detection tests. LBW-Net has several desirable
advantages over full-precision CNNs, including considerable memory savings,
energy efficiency, and faster deployment. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC dataset
show that compared with its 32-bit floating-point counterpart, the performance
of the 6-bit LBW-Net is nearly lossless in the object detection tasks, and can

unknown target in a video given the target specified by a bounding box in the
first frame. In this paper, we propose a dual network to better utilize
features among layers for visual tracking. It is observed that features in
higher layers encode semantic context while its counterparts in lower layers
are sensitive to discriminative appearance. Thus we exploit the hierarchical
features in different layers of a deep model and design a dual structure to
obtain better feature representation from various streams, which is rarely
investigated in previous work. To highlight geometric contours of the target,
we integrate the hierarchical feature maps with an edge detector as the coarse
prior maps to further embed local details around the target. To leverage the
robustness of our dual network, we train it with random patches measuring the
similarities between the network activation and target appearance, which serves
as a regularization to enforce the dual network to focus on target object. The
proposed dual network is updated online in a unique manner based on the
observation that the target being tracked in consecutive frames should share
more similar feature representations than those in the surrounding background.
It is also found that for a target object, the prior maps can help further
enhance performance by passing message into the output maps of the dual
network. Therefore, an independent component analysis with reference algorithm
(ICA-R) is employed to extract target context using prior maps as guidance.
Online tracking is conducted by maximizing the posterior estimate on the final
maps with stochastic and periodic update. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on two large-scale benchmark data sets show that the proposed
algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-arts.

introduced in the field of universal algebra to deal with algebras equipped
with metric structures such as normed vector spaces. Recently a similar notion
of quantitative algebra is used in computer science to formulate computational
effects of probabilistic programs. In this paper we show that varieties of
metric algebras (classes defined by a set of metric equations) are exactly
classes closed under (metric versions of) subalgebras, products and quotients.
This result implies the class of normed vector spaces cannot be defined by
metric equations, differently from the classical case where the class of vector

very natural class of formulas since they cannot express such a typical class

superprocess. The pathwise uniqueness of their solutions with non-Lipschitz
coefficients has attracted wide attention and in particular, the square-root
coefficient case was listed as a long standing open problem in the famous
literature (i.e. Perkins \cite{Perkins02} p217.) This short note gives an
affirmative answer to this open problem.
  Our idea is using the $\varphi_k(x)$ function constructed by Yamada-Watanable
to prove that
  \beqlb \lab{key}
  \E_{\mu}| X_{t}(z)-Y_{t}(z) | = \lim_{k \ra \infty}
\E_{\mu}|\int_{\r}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_k}} \rho_{\epsilon_k}(z-x)[
X_{t}(x)-Y_{t}(x)]dx |=0 .
  \eeqlb
  However, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_k}}
\rho_{\epsilon_k}(x)=p_{\epsilon_k}(x)$, the stable kernel, is not
square-integrable uniformly in $k$ and we cannot directly use the heat kernel
or stable kernel convolution transformation. This forces us to go a new way in
which we have used the linear and reciprocal linear properties of $\varphi_k$
and $\varphi^{\prime \prime}_k$, respectively, making a $\rho_{\epsilon_k}$
convolution transformation first, then, taking expectation and multiplying
singularity factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_k}}$ and finally letting $k \ra
\infty$ to estimate and derive (\ref{key}). In this way, we have avoided the
non-uniform square integrability of the stochastic integral terms which involve
the singularity. The same idea also can be used to prove the pathwise
uniqueness of the nonnegative solutions of stochastic heat equation with
$\alpha$ coefficients ($1/2 \leq \alpha$) since by a same idea we can construct
the $\varphi_k(x)$ functions with $1/2 \leq \alpha$.

Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array at 15.7 GHz. Optical
observations presented by Milisavljevic et al. demonstrated that SN 2014C
metamorphosed from a stripped-envelope Type Ib SN into a strongly interacting
Type IIn SN within 1 year. The AMI light curve clearly shows two distinct radio
peaks, the second being a factor of 4 times more luminous than the first peak.
This double bump morphology indicates two distinct phases of mass-loss from the
progenitor star with the transition between density regimes occurring at
100-200 days. This reinforces the interpretation that SN 2014C exploded in a
low density region before encountering a dense Hydrogen-rich shell of
circumstellar material that was likely ejected by the progenitor prior to the
explosion. The AMI flux measurements of the first light curve bump are the only
reported observations taken within ~50 to ~125 days post-explosion, before the
blast-wave encountered the Hydrogen shell. Simplistic synchrotron
self-absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) modelling suggest that
some physical properties of SN 2014C, such as the mass-loss rate, are
consistent with the properties of other Type Ibc and IIn SNe. However, our
single frequency data does not allow us to distinguish between these two

Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector
random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics
and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the
autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\times 2^p$ transition
matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\ll p$ or by two sparse
matrices of dimensions $p\times p^2$ and $p\times p$, respectively,
parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process
mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\log p)$. The hidden
constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of
the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node
in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has
in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated
by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the

protocol that also finds many important applications for quantum informatics.
Given a quantum entangled resource, it is crucial to know to what extent one
can accomplish the QT. This is usually assessed in terms of output fidelity,
which can also be regarded as an operational measure of entanglement. In the
case of multipartite communication when each communicator possesses a part of
$N$-partite entangled state, not all pairs of communicators can achieve a high
fidelity due to monogamy property of quantum entanglement. We here investigate
how such a monogamy relation arises in multipartite continuous-variable (CV)
teleportation particularly using a Gaussian entangled state. We show a strict
monogamy relation, i.e. a sender cannot achieve a fidelity higher than optimal
cloning limit with more than one receiver. While this seems rather natural
owing to the no-cloning theorem, a strict monogamy relation still holds even if
the sender is allowed to individually manipulate the reduced state in
collaboration with each receiver to improve fidelity. The local operations are
further extended to non-Gaussian operations such as photon subtraction and
addition, and we demonstrate that the Gaussian cloning bound cannot be beaten
by more than one pair of communicators. Furthermore we investigate a
quantitative form of monogamy relation in terms of teleportation capability,
for which we show that a faithful monogamy inequality does not exist.

incorporating the LHV model only as a particular case and correctly reproducing

us to construct nonsignaling analogs of Bell inequalities and to specify

a general nonsignaling case. For quantum correlation scenarios on an N-qudit

for point masses interacting only through gravity by taking into account the
finite mass effect of the inner planet. We find that efficient CHEM requires
that the systems should have m_1<<m_0 and m_1<<m_2. In addition to the gravity
for point masses, we examine the importance of the short-range forces, and
provide an analytical estimate of the migration time scale. We perform a series
of numerical simulations in CHEM for systems consisting of a sun-like central
star, giant gas inner planet and planetary outer perturber, including the
short-range forces and stellar and planetary dissipative tides. We find that
most of such systems end up with a tidal disruption, a small fraction of the
systems produce prograde hot Jupiters (HJs), but no retrograde one. In
addition, we extend CHEM to super-Earth mass range, and show that the formation
of close-in super-Earths in prograde orbits is also possible. Finally, we carry
out CHEM simulation for the observed hierarchical triple and counter-orbiting
HJ systems. We find that CHEM can explain a part of the former systems, but it
is generally very difficult to reproduce counter-orbiting HJ systems.

for a cache-oblivious adaptation of parallel TU decomposition for rectangular
matrices over finite fields. The TU algorithm of \cite{Dumas} requires index
conversion routines for which the cost to encode and decode the chosen curve is
significant. Using a detailed analysis of the number of bit operations required
for the encoding and decoding procedures, and filtering the cost of lookup
tables that represent the recursive decomposition of the Hilbert curve, we show
that the Morton-hybrid order incurs the least cost for index conversion
routines that are required throughout the matrix decomposition as compared to
the Hilbert, Peano, or Morton orders. The motivation lies in that cache
efficient parallel adaptations for which the natural sequential evaluation
order demonstrates lower cache miss rate result in overall faster performance
on parallel machines with private or shared caches, on GPU's, or even cloud
computing platforms. We report on preliminary experiments that demonstrate how
the TURBO algorithm in Morton-hybrid layout attains orders of magnitude
improvement in performance as the input matrices increase in size. For example,
when $N = 2^{13}$, the row major TURBO algorithm concludes within about 38.6
hours, whilst the Morton-hybrid algorithm with truncation size equal to $64$
concludes within 10.6 hours.

lower layers of a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to model natural

one layer with random filters can also model textures although with less
variability. In this paper we ask the question as to why one layer CNNs with
random filters are so effective in generating textures? We theoretically show
that one layer convolutional architectures (without a non-linearity) paired
with the an energy function used in previous literature, can in fact preserve
and modulate frequency coefficients in a manner so that random weights and
pretrained weights will generate the same type of images. Based on the results
of this analysis we question whether similar properties hold in the case where
one uses one convolution layer with a non-linearity. We show that in the case
of ReLu non-linearity there are situations where only one input will give the
minimum possible energy whereas in the case of no nonlinearity, there are
always infinite solutions that will give the minimum possible energy. Thus we
can show that in certain situations adding a ReLu non-linearity generates less
variable images.

solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes and transient disturbances such
as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While high-speed solar wind streams pose a
continuous outflow, CMEs abruptly disrupt the rather steady structure causing
large deviations from the quiet solar wind conditions. For the first time, we
give a quantification of the duration of disturbed conditions (preconditioning)
for interplanetary space caused by CMEs. To this aim, we investigate the plasma
speed component of the solar wind and the impact of in situ detected CMEs
(ICMEs), compared to different background solar wind models (ESWF, WSA,
persistence model) for the time range 2011-2015. We quantify in terms of
standard error measures the deviations between modeled background solar wind
speed and observed solar wind speed. Using the mean absolute error, we obtain
an average deviation for quiet solar activity within a range of 75.1-83.1 km/s.
Compared to this baseline level, periods within the ICME interval showed an
increase of 18-32% above the expected background and the period of 2 days after
the ICME displayed an increase of 9-24%. We obtain a total duration of enhanced
deviations over about 3 and up to 6 days after the ICME start, which is much
longer than the average duration of an ICME disturbance itself (~1.3 days),
concluding that interplanetary space needs ~2-5 days to recover from the impact
of ICMEs. The obtained results have strong implications for studying CME

non-perturbative inputs in KT Factorization on invariant energy has a
sharp-peaked form. In this case the intrinsic mass scale is associated with
location of the peak(s). We also present models where the intrinsic scale is
generated by such peaks.

k=o(n^{1/2}/\log^{3/2}n)$ are proved by B. Bollig, M. Sauerhoff, D. Sieling,
and I. Wegener in 1998. Their lower bound technique was based on communication
complexity approach. For nondeterministic $k$-OBDD it is known that, if $k$ is
constant then polynomial size $k$-OBDD computes same functions as polynomial
size OBDD (The result of Brosenne, Homeister and Waack, 2006). In the same time
currently known hierarchies for nondeterministic read $k$-times Branching

1997, and for probabilistic read $k$-times Branching programs for $k\leq \log
n/3$ are proved by Hromkovic and Saurhoff in 2003.
  We show that increasing $k$ for polynomial size nodeterministic $k$-OBDD
makes model more powerful if $k$ is not constant. Moreover, we extend the
hierarchy for probabilistic and nondeterministic $k$-OBDDs for $ k=o(n/ \log
n)$. These results extends hierarchies for read $k$-times Branching programs,
but $k$-OBDD has more regular structure. The lower bound techniques we propose
are a ""functional description"" of Boolean function presented by
nondeterministic $k$-OBDD and communication complexity technique. We present
similar hierarchies for superpolynomial and subexponential width
nondeterministic $k$-OBDDs.
  Additionally we expand the hierarchies for deterministic $k$-OBDDs using our
lower bounds for $ k=o(n/ \log n)$. We also analyze similar hierarchies for
superpolynomial and subexponential width $k$-OBDDs.

of the promising solutions is reusing the ""experiences"" to construct a

the existing methods ignore the non-independent and identically distributed

This approach takes the transfer learning method as a tool to help reuse the
past experience for speeding up the evolutionary process, and at the same time,
any population based multiobjective algorithms can benefit from this
integration without any extensive modifications. To verify this, we incorporate
the proposed approach into the development of three well-known algorithms,
nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), multiobjective particle
swarm optimization (MOPSO), and the regularity model-based multiobjective

sources an emission of dipolar gravitational scalar radiation, in addition to

exponential coupling between the scalar field and the NS/WD matter. Owing to a

stars' scalar energy, which gives us the estimation for scalar masses of about
$10^{-21} eV/c^2$ and leads to a Yulkawa-like correction to the Newtonian

scalar background field, with small fluctuations, converged by iterative
interplay of the mass dimensional external scalar fields, the binary system
suffers from a spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The two scalarized NSs
dip in a Higgs-like gravitational scalar potential, where the massless scalar
background fluctuation field plays the role of Higgs field. Consequently, the
gravitational scalar background field becomes massive. The radiated gravitons,
propagating in a Yukawa-corrected potential, acquire a
scalar-background-dependent mass term, in a massive-scalar-field-mediated way.
We demonstrate that the mass of gravitons depends on intrinsic properties of
the sources, which is not a certain value. The background-dependent masses for
gravitons from scalarized orbital shrinking DNS is variable with the
compactness of two components, as well as the separation of the binary. We get
the effective masses for gravitons radiated from 8 detected DNS binaries with
more precise mass measurements in our galaxy, whose values appear to be of the
order of $10^{-23} ev/c^2$. It is found that more massive gravitons radiate
from more closer DNS system, consisting with the higher-frequency gravitational

temperatures ranging from 10 to 900 K. The results indicate that above certain
temperature, long and stable pentagonal atomic chains form in BCC Fe nanowires
with cross section width less than 2.83 nm. The temperature, above which the
pentagonal chains form, increases with increase in nanowire size. The
pentagonal chains have been observed to be highly stable over large plastic
strains and contribute to high ductility in Fe nanowires.

  the proof of Theorem 1",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a framework on a discrete observation of (marked) point
processes under the high-frequency observation is developed. Based on this
framework, we first clarify the relation between random coefficient
integer-valued autoregressive process with infinite order (RCINAR($\infty$))
and i.i.d.-marked self-exciting process, known as marked Hawkes process. For
this purpose, we show that the point process constructed of the sum of a
RCINAR($\infty$) converge weakly to a marked Hawkes process. This limit theorem
establish that RCINAR($\infty$) processes can be seen as a discretely observed
marked Hawkes processes when the observation frequency increases and thus build
a bridge between discrete-time series analysis and the analysis of
continuous-time stochastic process and give a new perspective in the point
process approach in extreme value theory. Second, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition of the stationarity of RCINAR($\infty$) process and give
its random coefficient autoregressive (RCAR) representation. Finally, as an
application of our results, we establish a rigorous theoretical justification
of self-exciting peaks over threshold (SEPOT) model, which is a well-known as a
(marked) Hawkes process model for the empirical analysis of extremal events in
financial econometrics and of which, however, the theoretical validity have
rarely discussed. Simulation results of the asymptotic properties of
RCINAR($\infty$) shows some interesting implications for statistical
applications.

a divergence-free driving velocity that is W 1,$\infty$ , in a two-dimensional
bounded polygon. Since the velocity is assumed fully non-homogeneous on the
boundary, existence and uniqueness of the solution require a boundary condition
on the open part $\Gamma$ -- where the normal component of u is strictly
negative. In a previous article, we studied the solutions in L 2 of this steady
transport equation. The methods, developed in this article, can be extended to
prove existence and uniqueness of a solution in H 1 with Dirichlet boundary
condition on $\Gamma$ -- only in the case where the normal component of u does
not vanish at the boundary of $\Gamma$ --. In the case where the normal
component of u vanishes at the boundary of $\Gamma$ -- , under appropriate
assumptions, we construct local H 1 solutions in the neighborhood of the
end-points of $\Gamma$ -- , which allow us to establish existence and
uniqueness of the solution in H 1 for the transport equation with a Dirichlet
boundary condition on $\Gamma$ -- .

  System Design to Prototype Results",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the implementation and application possibilities of a
compact full duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture where
direct communication exists between users, e.g., device-to-device (D2D) and
cellular link coexisting on the same spectrum. For the architecture of the
compact full duplex radio, we combine an analog self-interference canceler
based dual-polarization with high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and
Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based per-subcarrier digital self-interference
canceler. While we consider the compactness and power efficiency of an analog
solution, we focus on the digital canceler design with robustness to a
frequency-selective channel and high compatibility with a conventional LTE
system. For an over-the-air wireless experiment of full duplex testbed with a
two-user-pair, we implement a full duplex MIMO physical layer (PHY), supporting
20 MHz bandwidth, on an FPGA-based software-defined radio platform. Further, we
propose a novel timing synchronization method to construct a more viable full
duplex MIMO link. By having the full duplex link prototype fully operating in
real-time, we present the first characterization of the proposed compact full
duplex MIMO performance depending on the transmit power of the full duplex
node. We also show the link quality between nodes. One of the crucial insights
of this work is that the full duplex operation of a user is capable of
acquiring the throughput gain if the user has self-interference capability with
guaranteed performance.

urban street networks is one of them, and in particular to analyze criminal
aspects of a city. Several research groups have focused on such application,
but until now, there is a lack of a well-defined methodology for employing
complex networks in a whole crime analysis process, i.e. from data preparation
to a deep analysis of criminal communities. Furthermore, the ""toolset""
available for those works is not complete enough, also lacking techniques to
maintain up-to-date, complete crime datasets and proper assessment measures. In
this sense, we propose a threefold methodology for employing complex networks
in the detection of highly criminal areas within a city. Our methodology
comprises three tasks: (i) Mapping of Urban Crimes; (ii) Criminal Community
Identification; and (iii) Crime Analysis. Moreover, it provides a proper set of
assessment measures for analyzing intrinsic criminality of communities,
especially when considering different crime types. We show our methodology by
applying it to a real crime dataset from the city of San Francisco - CA, USA.
The results confirm its effectiveness to identify and analyze high criminality
areas within a city. Hence, our contributions provide a basis for further
developments on complex networks applied to crime analysis.

aerospace, the detection of anomalies is crucial. An efficient methodology for
automatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage
of the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS)
method. Based on the simultaneous spectral decomposition of two scatter
matrices, ICS leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the
Euclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original
coordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments
in a context where the dimension of the data is large. Unlike MD, ICS makes it
possible to select relevant components which removes the limitations. Owing to
the resulting dimension reduction, the method is expected to improve the power
of outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. It also greatly
simplifies outliers interpretation. The paper includes practical guidelines for
using ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers which is relevant in
high reliability standards fields. The choice of scatter matrices together with
the selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and
normality tests are addressed. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the
so called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This
choice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility
to derive theoretical results. A simulation study confirms the good properties
of the proposal and compares it with other scatter pairs. This study also
provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance
of our proposal is also evaluated on several real data sets using a
user-friendly R package accompanying the paper.

perturbations of certain edge weights, with the objective of preventing
observability of some modes of the network dynamics. To comply with the network

thus extending the classic literature on the observability radius of linear

optimization framework to determine a perturbation with smallest Frobenius norm
that renders a desired mode unobservable from the existing sensor nodes.
Second, we study the expected observability radius of networks with given

dependent on the connectivity properties of the network and we analytically
characterize optimal perturbations of line and star networks, showing that line
networks are inherently more robust than star networks.

discovered a few stars exhibiting peculiar eclipse-like events. They are most
probably caused by disintegrating bodies transiting in front of the star.
However, the nature of the bodies and obscuration events, such as those
observed in KIC8462852, remain mysterious. A swarm of comets or artificial
alien mega-structures have been proposed as an explanation for the latter
object.
  We explore the possibility that such eclipses are caused by the dust clouds
associated with massive parent bodies orbiting the host star.
  We assumed a massive object and a simple model of the dust cloud surrounding
the object. Then, we used the numerical integration to simulate the evolution
of the cloud, its parent body, and resulting light-curves as they orbit and
transit the star.
  We found that it is possible to reproduce the basic features in the
light-curve of KIC8462852 with only four objects enshrouded in dust clouds. The
fact that they are all on similar orbits and that such models require only a
handful of free parameters provides additional support for this hypothesis.
  This model provides an alternative to the comet scenario. With such physical
models at hand, at present, there is no need to invoke alien mega-structures
for an explanation of these light-curves.

  Applications in Image Analysis","To appear in JMIV Special Issue",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a PDE-based approach for finding optimal paths for the Reeds-Shepp
car. In our model we minimize a (data-driven) functional involving both
curvature and length penalization, with several generalizations. Our approach
encompasses the two and three dimensional variants of this model, state
dependent costs, and moreover, the possibility of removing the reverse gear of
the vehicle. We prove both global and local controllability results of the
models.
  Via eikonal equations on the manifold $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$
we compute distance maps w.r.t. highly anisotropic Finsler metrics, which
approximate the singular (quasi)-distances underlying the model. This is
achieved using a Fast-Marching (FM) method, building on work by Mirebeau. The
FM method is based on specific discretization stencils which are adapted to the
preferred directions of the Finsler metric and obey a generalized acuteness
property. The shortest paths can be found with a gradient descent method on the
distance map, which we formalize in a theorem. We justify the use of our
approximating metrics by proving convergence results.
  Our curve optimization model in $\mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ with
data-driven cost allows to extract complex tubular structures from medical
images, e.g. crossings, and incomplete data due to occlusions or low contrast.
Our work extends the results of Sanguinetti et al. on numerical sub-Riemannian
eikonal equations and the Reeds-Shepp Car to 3D, with comparisons to exact
solutions by Duits et al.
  Numerical experiments show the high potential of our method in two
applications: vessel tracking in retinal images for the case $d=2$, and brain
connectivity measures from diffusion weighted MRI-data for the case $d=3$,
extending the work of Bekkers et al. We demonstrate how the new model without
reverse gear better handles bifurcations.

performed with the ""phantom"" smoothed particle hydrodynamics code.
  For initially toroidal fields, we find two regimes. In the first, where the
cooling time is greater than five times the dynamical time, magnetic fields
reduce spiral density wave amplitudes, which in turn suppresses fragmentation.
This is the case even if the magnetic pressure is only a tenth of the thermal
pressure. The second regime occurs when the cooling time is sufficiently short
that magnetic fields cannot halt fragmentation.
  We find that magnetised discs produce more massive fragments, due to both the
additional pressure exerted by the magnetic field, and the additional angular
momentum transport induced by Maxwell stresses. The fragments are confined to a
narrower range of initial semimajor axes than those in unmagnetised discs. The
orbital eccentricity and inclination distributions of unmagnetised and
magnetised disc fragments are similar. Our results suggest the fragmentation
boundary could be at cooling times a factor of two lower than predicted by
purely hydrodynamical models.

function based on a diffusive Langevin equation. We employ ideas from
statistical mechanics to express the response of an equilibrium (i.e., time

diffusive relaxation mechanism. The equilibrium field is assumed to follow an
exponential joint probability density which is determined by a spatial local
interaction model. We then use linear response theory to express the temporal
evolution of the random field around the equilibrium state in terms of a
Langevin equation. The latter yields an equation of motion for the space-time
covariance function, which can be solved explicitly at certain limits. We use
the explicit covariance model obtained in one spatial dimension and time. By
means of the turning bands transform, we derive a non-separable space-time
covariance function in three space dimensions and time. We investigate the
mathematical properties of this space-time covariance function, and we use it

methodology in imaging sciences, where high dimensionality is often addressed
by using Bayesian models that are log-concave and whose posterior mode can be
computed efficiently by convex optimisation. Despite its success and wide
adoption, MAP estimation is not theoretically well understood yet. The
prevalent view in the community is that MAP estimation is not proper Bayesian
estimation in a decision-theoretic sense because it does not minimise a
meaningful expected loss function (unlike the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
estimator that minimises the mean squared loss). This paper addresses this
theoretical gap by presenting a decision-theoretic derivation of MAP estimation
in Bayesian models that are log-concave. A main novelty is that our analysis is
based on differential geometry, and proceeds as follows. First, we use the
underlying convex geometry of the Bayesian model to induce a Riemannian
geometry on the parameter space. We then use differential geometry to identify
the so-called natural or canonical loss function to perform Bayesian point
estimation in that Riemannian manifold. For log-concave models, this canonical
loss is the Bregman divergence associated with the negative log posterior
density. We then show that the MAP estimator is the only Bayesian estimator
that minimises the expected canonical loss, and that the posterior mean or MMSE
estimator minimises the dual canonical loss. We also study the question of MAP
and MSSE estimation performance in large scales and establish a universal bound
on the expected canonical error as a function of dimension, offering new
insights into the good performance observed in convex problems. These results
provide a new understanding of MAP and MMSE estimation in log-concave settings,
and of the multiple roles that convex geometry plays in imaging problems.

that these methods of annealing have dramatically different influence on the RS
lines. Annealing in vacuum below 500$^{\circ}$C leads to significant decrease
of both D-line, associated with defects, and 2D-line, associated with the
intact lattice structure, which can be explained by annealing-induced enhanced
doping. Further annealing in vacuum up to 1000$^{\circ}$C leads to significant
increase of 2D-line together with continuous decrease of D-line, which gives
evidence of partial removal of defects and recovery of the damaged lattice.
Annealing in forming gas is less effective in this sense. The blue shift of all
lines is observed after annealing. It is shown that below 500$^{\circ}$C, the
unintentional doping is the main mechanism of shift, while at higher annealing
temperatures, the lattice strain dominates due to mismatch of the thermal
expansion coefficient of graphene and the SiO$_{2}$ substrate. Inhomogeneous
distribution of stress and doping across the samples leads to the correlated
variation of the amplitude and the peak position of RS lines.

perturbative renormalization group can be carried out to all orders of
perturbation theory. This analysis predicts dimensional reduction, i.e., that
the critical properties of the random-field Ising model in $D$ dimensions are
identical to those of the pure Ising ferromagnet in $D-2$ dimensions. It is
well known that dimensional reduction is not true in three dimensions, thus
invalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report
high-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero
temperature. We illustrate universality by comparing different probability
distributions for the random fields. We compute all the relevant critical
exponents (including the critical slowing down exponent for the ground-state
finding algorithm), as well as several other renormalization-group invariants.
The estimated values of the critical exponents of the 5D random-field Ising
model are statistically compatible to those of the pure 3D Ising ferromagnet.
These results support the restoration of dimensional reduction at $D = 5$. We
thus conclude that the failure of the perturbative renormalization group is a

enabled bipeds to walk on flat and uneven indoor environments. But tasks that
require reliable contact with unstructured world surfaces, for example walking
on natural rocky terrain, need new perception and control algorithms.
  This thesis introduces 3D perception algorithms for contact tasks such as
foot placement in rough terrain environments. We introduce a new method to
identify and model potential contact areas between the robot's foot and a
surface using a set of bounded curved patches. We present a patch
parameterization model and an algorithm to fit and perceptually validate
patches to 3D point samples. Having defined the environment representation
using the patch model, we introduce a way to assemble patches into a spatial
map. This map represents a sparse set of local areas potentially appropriate
for contact between the robot and the surface. The process of creating such a
map includes sparse seed point sampling, neighborhood searching, as well as
patch fitting and validation. Various ways of sampling are introduced including
a real time bio-inspired system for finding patches statistically similar to
those that humans select while traversing rocky trails. These sparse patch
algorithms are integrated with a dense volumetric fusion of range data from a
moving depth camera, maintaining a dynamic patch map of relevant contact
surfaces around a robot in real time. We integrate and test the algorithms as

part of triples or even higher-order systems. Even though, the principles of
single stellar evolution and binary evolution, have been accepted for a long
time, the long-term evolution of stellar triples is poorly understood. The
presence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly
alter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical
behavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which
the eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and
outer orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of
tidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar
interactions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a
self-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body
dynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general
understanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems. In this paper, we
aim to address some of these hiatus, by discussing the dominant physical
processes of hierarchical triple evolution, and presenting heuristic recipes
for these processes. To improve our understanding on hierarchical stellar
triples, these descriptions are implemented in a public source code TrES which
combines three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach) with stellar
evolution and their mutual influences. Note that modeling through a phase of
stable mass transfer in an eccentric orbit is currently not implemented in TrES
, but can be implemented with the appropriate methodology at a later stage.

granules, surrounded by narrow dark intergranular lanes, are observed
everywhere. The granular pattern is a manifestation of convective motion at the
photospheric level, but its velocity structure in the height direction is
poorly understood observationally. Applying bisector analysis to a photospheric
spectral line recorded by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope, we derived the
velocity structure of the convective motion in granular regions and
intergranular lanes separately. The amplitude of motion of the convective
material decreases from 0.65 to 0.40 km/s as the material rises in granules,
whereas the amplitude of motion increases from 0.30 to 0.50 km/s as it descends
in intergranular lanes. These values are significantly larger than those
obtained in previous studies using bisector analysis. The acceleration of
descending materials with depth is not predicted from the convectively stable
condition in a stratified atmosphere. Such convective instability can be
developed more efficiently by radiative cooling and/or a gas pressure gradient,
which can control the dynamical behavior of convective material in
intergranular lanes. Our analysis demonstrated that bisector analysis is a
useful method for investigating the long-term dynamic behavior of convective
material when a large number of pixels is available. In addition, one example

Specifically, we show that the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm applied
to Gaussian scale mixtures leads to the lagged-diffusivity algorithm for
computing stationary points of the Perona-Malik diffusion equations. Moreover,
we show how mean field approximations to these Gaussian scale mixtures lead to
a modification of the lagged-diffusivity algorithm that better captures the
uncertainties in the restoration. Since this modification can be hard to
compute in practice we propose relaxations to the mean field objective to make
the algorithm computationally feasible. Our numerical experiments show that
this modified lagged-diffusivity algorithm often performs better at restoring
textured areas and fuzzy edges than the unmodified algorithm. As a second
application of the Gaussian scale mixture framework, we show how an efficient
sampling procedure can be obtained for the probabilistic model, making the
computation of the conditional mean and other expectations algorithmically
feasible. Again, the resulting algorithm has a strong resemblance to the
lagged-diffusivity algorithm. Finally, we show that a probabilistic version of

$\Gamma=G(\mathcal{O}_S)$ an arithmetic subgroup of a semisimple algebraic
$k$-group for some global field $k$ with ring of $S$-integers $\mathcal{O}_S$.
If the Lie algebra of $G$ is perfect, Lubotzky and Martin showed that if
$\Gamma$ has the weak Congruence Subgroup Property then $\Gamma$ has Polynomial
Representation Growth, that is, $r_n(\Gamma)\leq p(n)$ for some polynomial $p$.
By using a different approach, we show that the same holds for any semisimple
algebraic group $G$ including those with a non-perfect Lie algebra. In chapter
$4$ we show that if $\Gamma$ has the weak Congruence Subgroup Property then
$s_n(\Gamma)\leq n^{D\log n}$ for some constant $D$, where $s_n(\Gamma)$
denotes the number of subgroups of $\Gamma$ of index at most $n$. In chapter
$5$ we consider $\Gamma=1+J$, where $J$ is a finite nilpotent associative
algebra, this is called an algebra group. We provide counterexamples for any
prime $p$ for the Fake Degree Conjecture by looking at groups of the form
$\Gamma=1+I_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, where $I_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ is the augmentation ideal
of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[\pi]$ for some $p$-group $\pi$. Moreover, we
show that for such groups $r_1(\Gamma)=q^{K(\pi)-1}|B_0(\pi)|$, where
$B_0(\pi)$ is the Bogomolov multiplier of $\pi$. Finally in chapter $6$, we
consider $\Gamma=\prod_{i\in I} S_i$, where the $S_i$ are nonabelian finite
simple group. We show that within this class one can obtain any rate of
representation growth, i.e., for any $\alpha>0$ there exists
$\Gamma=\prod_{i\in I}S_i$ such that $r_n(\Gamma)\sim n^\alpha$.

reflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the
incident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.
However, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves
can be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this
phenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several
theoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating
cylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has
never been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection
of superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of
water are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum
amplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,
in a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant
scattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can
transfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our
experimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow
water waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black
hole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of
gravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both
theoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of
gravitational waves.

which predicts that free Dirac electrons exhibit a rapid trembling motion even
in the absence of external forces. The trembling motion of an electron results
from the interference between the positive and the negative-energy solutions of
the Dirac equation, separated by one MeV, leading to oscillations at extremely
high frequencies which are out of reach experimentally. Recently, it was shown
theoretically that electrons in III-V semiconductors are governed by similar
equations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The small energy splittings
up to meV result in Zitterbewegung at much smaller frequencies which should be
experimentally accessible as an AC current. Here, we demonstrate the
Zitterbewegung of electrons in a solid. We show that coherent electron
Zitterbewegung can be triggered by initializing an ensemble of electrons in the
same spin states in strained n-InGaAs and is probed as an AC current at GHz
frequencies. Its amplitude is shown to increase linearly with both the
spin-orbit coupling strength and the Larmor frequency of the external magnetic
field. The latter dependence is the hallmark of the dynamical generation
mechanism of the oscillatory motion of the Zitterbewegung. Our results
demonstrate that relativistic quantum mechanics can be studied in a rather
simple solid state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large

understood that conflicting sources of information may contaminate the

caused by the light normal tails follows from an undesirable effect: the
posterior concentrates in an area in between the different sources with a large
enough scaling to incorporate them all. The theory of conflict resolution in
Bayesian statistics (O'Hagan and Pericchi (2012)) recommends to address this
problem by limiting the impact of outliers to obtain conclusions consistent
with the bulk of the data. In this paper, we propose a model with super
heavy-tailed errors to achieve this. We prove that it is wholly robust, meaning
that the impact of outliers gradually vanishes as they move further and further
away form the general trend. The super heavy-tailed density is similar to the
normal outside of the tails, which gives rise to an efficient estimation
procedure. In addition, estimates are easily computed. This is highlighted via

  Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from
presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make
financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close
elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. Although several
studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock
returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and
election induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral
level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the
reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This
hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the
elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of
the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we
adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around
the election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election
result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some
cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although
Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal
return are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.
Besides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some
sectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,
financials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route
(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that
will benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
renegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,
increasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and
rolling back Obamacare.

solutions of classical hamiltonian systems that are either compatible with a
cosymplectic or a contact structure. As it is well known, the first structure
plays a central role in the theory of time-dependent hamiltonians, whilst the
second is here used to treat classical hamiltonians including dissipation
terms.
  The interest of a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi equation is the primordial
observation that if a hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be projected into a
configuration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the integral curves of
the projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$ can be transformed into integral curves
of $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In
this way, we use the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to derive solutions of
physical systems with a time-dependent hamiltonian formulation or including
dissipative terms. Explicit, new expressions for a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi
equation are obtained on a cosymplectic and a contact manifold. These equations
are later used to solve physical examples containing explicit time dependence,
as it is the case of a unidimensional trigonometric system, and two dimensional
nonlinear oscillators as Winternitz--Smorodinsky oscillators. For explicit
dissipative behavior, we solve the example of a unidimensional damped
oscillator.

presence of a very large number of low-mass haloes, too small to have made a

warm dark matter (WDM), predict a much smaller number of such low-mass haloes.
Strong lensing systems offer the possibility of detecting small-mass haloes
through the distortions they induce in the lensed image. Here we show that the
main contribution to the image distortions comes from haloes along the line of
sight rather than subhaloes in the lens as has normally been assumed so far.
These interlopers enhance the differences between the predictions of CDM and
WDM models. We derive the total perturber mass function, including both
subhaloes and interlopers, and show that measurements of approximately 20
strong lens systems with a detection limit of $M_{\rm low}=10^7 h^{-1}

Complex deformation of the mechanical structure results in charges with
opposite polarities appearing on same surface, leading to current loss in the

comprise diodes that consume power and have undesirable forward bias. To
address the above issues, we devise a novel integrated piezoelectric energy
harvesting device that is structured by stacking a layer of quantum dots (QDs)

electrical charges generated from the piezoelectric material because of its
adaptable conductance to the electrochemical potentials of both sides of the

confounded by incomplete knowledge of the role of chirality and racemization in
organic compounds in the origination of living organisms. Chirality is an
essential feature of enzymes as well as many lock-and-key type structures.
There are four known processes that can act on complex organic molecules to
promote racemization for abiogenesis: quantum-tunneling effects; selection via
interaction with circularly polarized light (CPL); templating processes; and
interactions with electrical and magnetic (EM) fields. These occur in different
places, respectively: cold interstellar space; regions of space with energetic
photons, dust and/or magnetic fields; and mineral surfaces (for both templating
and EM fields). Chirality as a feature of terrestrial life suggests neither a
special place for local development of homochirality nor for extra-terrestrial
enrichment and delivery. The presence of these molecules in three competing
scenarios for life's origin - chemical gardens, geothermal fields, and ice
substrates - relies on a framework of hypothesis and estimation. An
easily-modified worksheet is included in the supplemental material that allows
a user to generate different scenarios and data related to the distribution of

technology where they could occur, namely in the description of the universe in
one sense, and in nano-scale or particle physics in another sense, the issue of
extreme values (not in statistical meaning here) is not irrelevant. The
question placed and discussed in this paper is whether the present kelvin
scale, based on Lord Kelvin second definition (our currently accepted concept
of temperature), applies over a full range between bounds (zero, infinite) or
not, and about the concept of temperature in itself in the extremes regions.
The aim, however, is not to provide an answer, but to suggest there are
difficulties with the application of current concepts at extremes of
temperature.

disk and the equilateral triangle which minimize a p-norm of eigenvalues of the
Dirichlet-Laplace operator. The extremal case of the infinity norm, where we
minimize the largest fundamental eigenvalue of each cell, is one of our main
interests. We propose three numerical algorithms which approximate the optimal
configurations and we obtain tight upper bounds for the energy, which are
better than the ones given by theoretical results. A thorough comparison of the
results obtained by the three methods is given. We also investigate the
behavior of the minimal partitions with respect to p. This allows us to see
when partitions minimizing the 1-norm and the infinity-norm are different.

not only a final result but also the physical process which leads to the
result. The quantum correlation at a distance better known as the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox may be easily understood being depicted in the
time-ordered quantum diagrams. In the diagrams one can clearly see what the
so-called entangled quantum states really are and how they contribute to the
violation of Bell inequality. The wave function phase relations that are the
actual physical ""common cause in the past"" for the observed correlation become
also visual and evident. Thus the diagram analysis shows that the phenomenon of
distant quantum correlation has simple causal and local explanation and there
is no need to invent various extravagant constructions contradicting the
established physical principles as well as usual common sense considerations.

proper diffusive scaling the random walk exhibits a non-standard limit
behaviour. In addition to the coordinate of the random walk in $\mathbb Z^d$ we
introduce an extra variable that characterizes the position of the random walk
in the period and show that this two-component process converges in law to a
limit Markov process. The components of the limit process are mutually coupled,
thus we cannot expect that the limit behaviour of the coordinate process is
Markov. We also prove the convergence in the path space for the said random
walk.

society are considered. The presence of a tax system combined with a
redistribution process is taken into account, as well as the occurrence of tax
evasion. In particular, the existence is postulated, in relation to the level
of evasion, of different individual taxpayer behaviors. The effects of the
mentioned different behaviors on shape and features of the emerging income
distribution profile are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively.
Numerical solutions show that the Gini inequality index of the total population
increases when the evasion level is higher, but does not depend significantly
on the evasion spread. For fixed spread, the relative difference between the
average incomes of the worst evaders and honest taxpayers increases
approximately as a quadratic function of the evasion level.

  Mid-continent Independent System Operator",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As power grids incorporate increased renewable generation such as wind and
solar, their variability creates growing challenges for grid stability and
efficiency. We study two facets: power the grid is unable to accept
(curtailment), and power that is assigned zero economic value by the grid
(negative or zero price). Collectively we term these ""stranded power"" or SP.
  We study stranded power in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator
(MISO), characterizing quantity and temporal structure. First, stranded power
is available in the MISO grid 99% of the time, and often in intervals >100
hours, with characteristic seasonal and time-of-day patterns. Average stranded
power often exceeds 1 GW, with duty factors as high as 30%. About 30% of all
wind generation in MISO is stranded. Examination of the top 10 individual sites
shows stranded power can be as high as 70% duty factor and 250MW. Trends over
the past 3.5 years suggest stranded power is a persistent phenomenon. The study
characterizes opportunities to exploit stranded power.
  We consider using energy storage to increase the utility of stranded power.
For a range of power levels and uniformly-distributed storage, adding 5 hours
of storage doubles duty factor to 30% at 4MW, but another 95 hours is required
for the next 15% increase. At 4MW with 50 hours of storage, only 3 of 200 sites
reach 100% duty factor, and with 100 hours required for the next 10 sites.
Higher power levels require 100's of hours. Storage at the top 10 sites is more
productive, 5 hours increases duty factor to 70% at 4MW, but further storage
has diminishing benefits. Studies of the amount of power served by storage show
that distribution to the best sites provides 2 to 3.7-fold advantages over
uniform distribution.
