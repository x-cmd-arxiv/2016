cellular networks and calls for innovative solutions to reduce the network
congestion and improve user experience. In this context, user-provided networks
(UPNs), where mobile users share their Internet access by exploiting their
diverse network resources and needs, turn out to be very promising.
Heterogeneous users with advanced handheld devices can form connections in a
distributed fashion and unleash dormant network resources at the network edge.
However, the success of such services heavily depends on users' willingness to
contribute their resources, such as network access and device battery energy.
In this paper, we introduce a general framework for UPN services and design a
bargaining-based distributed incentive mechanism to ensure users participation.
The proposed mechanism determines the resources that each user should
contribute in order to maximise the aggregate data rate in UPN, and fairly
allocate the benefit among the users. The numerical results verify that the
service can always improve performance, and such improvement increases with the
diversity of the users' resources. Quantitatively, it can reach an average 30%
increase of the total served traffic for a typical scenario even with only 6
mobile users.

get the future reward of the sequence. The scorer is based on a first-order
graph-based parser with bidirectional LSTM, which catches different parsing

effect of a uniform magnetic field. At densities which are incommensurate with
flux, the ground state is a Meissner state, or a vortex state, depending on the
strength of the flux. When the density is commensurate with the flux,
analytical arguments predict the existence of a ground state of central charge
$c = 1$, which displays signatures compatible with the expected Laughlin state
at $\nu=1/2$. This differs from the coupled wire construction of the Laughlin
state in that there exists a nonzero backscattering term in the edge
Hamiltonian. We construct a phase diagram versus density and flux in order to
delimit the region where this precursor to the Laughlin state is the ground
state, by using a combination of bosonization and numerics based on the density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization. We obtain the
phase diagram from local observables and central charge. We use bipartite
charge fluctuations to deduce the Luttinger parameter for the edge Luttinger
liquid corresponding to the Laughlin state. The properties studied with local
observables are confirmed by the long distance behavior of correlation
functions. Our findings are consistent with a calculation of the many body
ground state transverse conductivity in a thin torus geometry for parameters
corresponding to the Laughlin state. The model considered is simple enough such
that the precursor to the Laughlin state could be realized in current ultracold

the elongated lanes of likely charges interact with increasing field in the
orthogonal plane using Brownian Dynamics simulations. We show that the system
undergoes a structural and dynamical cross-over: from an initial fast-relaxing
homogeneous phase to a heterogeneous lane phase following a slow relaxation via
an intermediate phase with mixed relaxation. Our observations also affirm the
coexistence of multiple time and length scales in this phase. Unlike glasses,
these time and length scales are not separated by orders of magnitude, they are
comparable in magnitudes. Using a phenomenological model, we, further,
reinforce that these competing relaxations are a manifesta- tion of
heterogeneity in diffusion which is rather generic in systems with such

equivalence relation are studied; the set of these permutations is called
$\mathrm{Perm}$, the group of all recursive permutations $\mathcal{G}$.
Multiple equivalent computable representations of decidable equivalence
relations are provided. $\mathcal{G}$-conjugacy in $\mathrm{Perm}$ is
characterised by computable isomorphy of cycle equivalence relations. This
result parallels the equivalence of cycle type equality and conjugacy in the
full symmetric group of the natural numbers.
  Conditions are presented for a permutation $f \in \mathcal{G}$ to be in
$\mathrm{Perm}$ and for a decidable equivalence relation to appear as the cycle
relation of a member of $\mathcal{G}$. In particular, two normal forms for the
cycle structure of permutations are defined and it is shown that conjugacy to a
permutation in the first normal form is equivalent to membership in
$\mathrm{Perm}$. $\mathrm{Perm}$ is further characterised as the set of maximal
permutations in a family of preordered subsets of automorphism groups of
decidable equivalences.
  Conjugacy to a permutation in the second normal form corresponds to decidable
cycles plus decidable cycle finiteness problem. Cycle decidability and cycle
finiteness are both shown to have the maximal one-one degree of the Halting
Problem. Cycle finiteness is used to prove that conjugacy in $\mathrm{Perm}$
cannot be decided and that it is impossible to compute cycle deciders for
products of members of $\mathrm{Perm}$ and finitary permutations. It is also
shown that $\mathrm{Perm}$ is not recursively enumerable and that it is not a
group.

we consider system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle
autonomously decides what actions to take in order to quickly identify the

candidate trajectory using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It uses
sampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and
find a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. We
validate our method in simulation and on a real system showing the feasibility
and repeatability of the proposed approach. Our planner creates trajectories
which reduce model parameter convergence time and uncertainty by a factor of

sulphur-hexafluoride gas for pressures in the range 0.2 -- 5 bar and for a
wavelength of $\lambda=403.0$ nm. The high quality data are compared to a
number of light scattering models in order to address the effects of rotational
and vibrational relaxation. While the vibrational relaxation rate is so slow
that vibration degrees of freedom remain frozen, rotations relax on time scales
comparable to those of the density fluctuations. Therefore, the heat capacity,
the thermal conductivity and the bulk viscosity are all frequency-dependent
transport coefficients. This is relevant for the Tenti model that depends on
the values chosen for these transport coefficients. This is not the case for
the other two models considered: a kinetic model based on rough-sphere
interactions, and a model based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. The deviations
with the experiment are similar between the three different models, except for
the hydrodynamic model at pressures $p \lesssim 2\;{\rm bar}$. As all models
are in line with the ideal gas law, we hypothesize the presence of real gas
effects in the measured spectra.

ejection of gas via these outflows is believed to remove angular momentum from
the protostellar system, thus permitting young stars to grow by accretion of
material from the protostellar disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow
ejection is not yet understood, but is believed to be closely linked to the
protostellar disk. Assorted scenarios have been proposed to explain
protostellar outflows; the main difference between these models is the region
where acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself
('X-wind', or stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar
disk (disk wind), or at the interface between. Because of the limits of
observational studies, outflow launching regions have so far only been probed
by indirect extrapolation. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide
toward the outflow associated with the TMC1A protostellar system. These data
show that gas is ejected from a region extending up to a radial distance of 25
astronomical units from the central protostar, and that angular momentum is
removed from an extended region of the disk. This demonstrates that the
outflowing gas is launched by an extended disk wind from a Keplerian disk.
Hence, we rule out X-wind and stellar wind launching scenarios as the source of
the emission on the scales we observe.

coset nilprogression in upper-triangular form. This can be thought of as a
nilpotent version of the Freiman-Bilu result that a generalised arithmetic
progression can be efficiently contained in a proper generalised arithmetic
progression, and indeed an important ingredient in the proof is a Lie-algebra
version of the geometry-of-numbers argument at the centre of that result. We
also present some applications. We verify a conjecture of Benjamini that if $S$
is a symmetric generating set for a group such that $1\in S$ and $|S^n|\le
Mn^D$ at some sufficiently large scale $n$ then $S$ exhibits polynomial growth
of the same degree $D$ at all subsequent scales, in the sense that
$|S^r|\ll_{M,D}r^D$ for every $r\ge n$. Our methods also provide an important
ingredient in a forthcoming companion paper in which we reprove and sharpen a
result about scaling limits of vertex-transitive graphs of polynomial growth
due to Benjamini, Finucane and the first author. We also note that our
arguments imply that every approximate group has a large subset with a large

theory of nonstationary Gabor frames (NSGFs). The algorithm extends the
techniques of the classical phase vocoder (PV) by incorporating adaptive
time-frequency (TF) representations and adaptive phase locking. The adaptive TF
representations imply good time resolution for the onsets of attack transients
and good frequency resolution for the sinusoidal components. We estimate the
phase values only at peak channels and the remaining phases are then locked to
the values of the peaks in an adaptive manner. During attack transients we keep
the stretch factor equal to one and we propose a new strategy for determining
which channels are relevant for reinitializing the corresponding phase values.
In contrast to previously published algorithms we use a non-uniform NSGF to
obtain a low redundancy of the corresponding TF representation. We show that
with just three times as many TF coefficients as signal samples, artifacts such
as phasiness and transient smearing can be greatly reduced compared to the
classical PV. The proposed algorithm is tested on both synthetic and real world

of the single-layer definition leads to a strong non-local rule, and results in
a dramatic change in the response of the system to damage. The giant component
collapses discontinuously in a hybrid transition characterised by avalanches of
diverging mean size. We also consider another definition, which imposes weaker
conditions on percolation and allows local calculation, and also leads to
different sized giant components depending on whether we consider an activation

is deemed mandatory for both, singlet exciton fission and a band-like
transport. Such a coupling is manifested, $e.g.$, by the Davydov-splitting of
the lowest-energy exciton transition in crystalline organic solids. For the
model system perfluoropentacene, the corresponding transitions in the
experimental, polarisation-resolved absorption spectra are identified by
theoretical calculations based on the concept of H- and J- aggregation. Optical
injection into the first vibronic progression of the fundamental exciton
transitions significantly perturbs the higher-energy transitions that are
associated to H-type aggregates of the $S_0 \rightarrow S_3$ transition during

necessity for efficient carrier extraction as triplet accumulation may be
detrimental to both, singlet exciton fission and any potentially band like

excitations can perturb the electronic band structure in organic crystals and
highlight their correlated nature by potentially distorting the lattice.

Further, we describe how asymptotically conservative confidence intervals can

appropriateness of the proposed methods in small and moderate samples. The

improvements in the power of the resulting analysis over the classical analysis

expected from a canonical IMF observed in low-mass ellipticals. A direct
extrapolation of such a bottom-heavy IMF to high stellar masses ($m >= 8$

holes, and therefore of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), per unit near-IR
luminosity in these galaxies. Peacock et al. (2014) searched for evidence of

different QKD protocols have been proposed theoretically and implemented

protocols in order to improve noise resistance and increase the data rate
[3-7]. Hitherto, no experimental verification of high-dimensional QKD in the
single-photon regime has been conducted outside of the laboratory. Here, we
report the realization of such a single-photon QKD system in a turbulent

spin and orbital angular momentum photonic degrees of freedom. This combination
of optical angular momenta allows us to create a 4-dimensional state [8];
wherein, using a high-dimensional BB84 protocol [3, 4], a quantum bit error
rate of 11\% was attained with a corresponding secret key rate of 0.65 bits per
sifted photon. While an error rate of 5\% with a secret key rate of 0.43 bits
per sifted photon is achieved for the case of 2-dimensional structured photons.
Even through moderate turbulence without active wavefront correction, it is
possible to securely transmit information carried by structured photons,
opening the way for intra-city high-dimensional quantum communications under

precipitation at a particular time. The probabilistic behavior of such a region
is an issue of interest in meteorological studies. A region under rainfall can
be viewed as a shape object of a special kind, where scale and rotational
invariance are not necessarily desirable attributes of a mathematical
representation. For modeling variation in objects of this type, we propose an
approximation of the boundary that can be represented as a real valued
function, and arrive at further approximation through functional principal
component analysis, after suitable adjustment for asymmetry and incompleteness
in the data. The analysis of an open access satellite data set on monsoon
precipitation over Eastern India leads to explanation of most of the variation
in shapes of the regions under rainfall through a handful of interpretable
functions that can be further approximated parametrically. The most important
aspect of shape is found to be the size followed by contraction/elongation,

remarkably stable across calendar years and across different thresholds for

guarantees the achievement of an asymptotic consensus. For the ""evaporation"" of
the dummy agent, the strength of its influences on the other agents vanishes,
which leads to the concept of latent consensus. We obtain a closed-form
expression for the consensus when the connections of the hub are symmetric, in
this case, the impact of the hub upon the consensus remains fixed. On the other
hand, if the hub is essentially influenced by the agents, whereas its influence
on them tends to zero, then the consensus is expressed by the scalar product of
the vector of column means of the Laplacian eigenprojection of $\Gamma$ and the
initial state vector of the system. Another protocol, which assumes the
presence of vanishingly weak uniform background links between the agents, leads
to the same latent consensus.

states of bosonic continuous variable systems. We derive a simplified necessary
and sufficient separability criterion for arbitrary Gaussian states of $m$ vs
$n$ modes, which relies on convex optimisation over marginal covariance
matrices on one subsystem only. We further revisit the currently known results
stating the equivalence between separability and positive partial transposition
(PPT) for specific classes of Gaussian states. Using matrix analysis techniques
such as Schur complements and matrix means, we provide a unified treatment and
compact proofs of all these results. In particular, we recover the
PPT-separability equivalence for: (i) Gaussian states of $1$ vs $n$ modes; and
(ii) isotropic Gaussian states. In passing, we also retrieve (iii) the recently
established equivalence between separability of a Gaussian state and and its
complete Gaussian extendability. Our techniques are then applied to progress
beyond the state of the art. We show that: (iv) Gaussian states that are
invariant under partial transposition are necessarily separable; (v) the PPT
criterion is necessary and sufficient for separability for Gaussian states of
$m$ vs $n$ modes that are symmetric under the exchange of any two modes
belonging to one of the parties; and (vi) Gaussian states which remain PPT
under passive optical operations can not be entangled by them either. This is
not a foregone conclusion per se (since Gaussian bound entangled states do
exist) and settles a question that had been left unanswered in the existing
literature on the subject. This paper, enjoyable by both the quantum optics and
the matrix analysis communities, overall delivers technical and conceptual
advances which are likely to be useful for further applications in continuous
variable quantum information theory, beyond the separability problem.

and machine learning models in recent years. This has been coupled with many
algorithmic advances in the area of submodular optimization: (SO)
$\min/\max~f(S): S \in \mathcal{F}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a given family of
feasible sets over a ground set $V$ and $f:2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is
submodular. In this work we focus on a more general class of \emph{multivariate
submodular optimization} (MVSO) problems: $\min/\max~f (S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k):
S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in \mathcal{F}$. Here we use $\uplus$
to denote disjoint union and hence this model is attractive where resources are
being allocated across $k$ agents, who share a `joint' multivariate nonnegative
objective $f(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k)$ that captures some type of submodularity
(i.e. diminishing returns) property. We provide some explicit examples and
potential applications for this new framework.
  For maximization, we show that practical algorithms such as accelerated
greedy variants and distributed algorithms achieve good approximation
guarantees for very general families (such as matroids and $p$-systems). For
arbitrary families, we show that monotone (resp. nonmonotone) MVSO admits an
$\alpha (1-1/e)$ (resp. $\alpha \cdot 0.385$) approximation whenever monotone
(resp. nonmonotone) SO admits an $\alpha$-approximation over the multilinear
formulation. This substantially expands the family of tractable models for
submodular maximization. For minimization, we show that if SO admits a
$\beta$-approximation over \emph{modular} functions, then MVSO admits a
$\frac{\beta \cdot n}{1+(n-1)(1-c)}$-approximation where $c\in [0,1]$ denotes
the curvature of $f$, and this is essentially tight. Finally, we prove that
MVSO has an $\alpha k$-approximation whenever SO admits an
$\alpha$-approximation over the convex formulation.

source and channel coding, that emerges from the availability of a common
observation at the encoders, or side information at the encoders and the
decoder, is investigated. It is shown that separation is optimal when the
encoders have access to a common observation whose lossless recovery is
required at the decoder, and the two sources are independent conditioned on
this common observation. Optimality of separation is also proved when the
encoder and the decoder have access to shared side information conditioned on
which the two sources are independent. These separation results obtained in the
presence of side information are then utilized to provide a set of necessary
conditions for the transmission of correlated sources over a MAC without side

transmission of binary and Gaussian sources over a MAC, it is shown that they
can potentially be tighter than the existing results in the literature,

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ per parameter. Finally, we test the performance of EUNNs on

pedestrian detector and pose estimator without any pedestrian observations.
Given a single image and auxiliary scene information in the form of camera
parameters and geometric layout of the scene, the Visual Compiler first infers
geometrically and photometrically accurate images of humans in that scene
through the use of computer graphics rendering. Using these renders we learn a
scene-and-region specific spatially-varying fully convolutional neural network,
for simultaneous detection, pose estimation and segmentation of pedestrians. We
demonstrate that when real human annotated data is scarce or non-existent, our
data generation strategy can provide an excellent solution for bootstrapping
human detection and pose estimation. Experimental results show that our
approach outperforms off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and
pose estimators that are trained on real data.

recently been shown by Eperon, Reall, and Santos (ERS) to exhibit a non-linear
instability featuring the growth of excitations at an ""evanescent ergosurface""
of infinite redshift. We argue that this growth may be treated as adiabatic
evolution along a family of exactly supersymmetric solutions in the limit where
the excitations are Aichelburg-Sexl-like shockwaves. In the 2-charge system
such solutions may be constructed explicitly, incorporating full backreaction,
and are in fact special cases of known microstate geometries. In a near-horizon
limit, they reduce to Aichelburg-Sexl shockwaves in $AdS_3 \times S^3$
propagating along one of the angular directions of the sphere. Noting that the
ERS analysis is valid in the limit of large microstate angular momentum $j$, we
use the above identification to interpret their instability as a transition
from rare smooth microstates with large angular momentum to more typical
microstates with smaller angular momentum. This entropic driving terminates
when the angular momentum decreases to $j \sim \sqrt{n_1n_5}$ where the density
of microstates is maximal. We argue that, at this point, the large stringy
corrections to such microstates will render them non-linearly stable. We
identify a possible mechanism for this stabilization and detail an illustrative
toy model.

conversion using the nonlinearity of a single Josephson junction, we can
release the cavity state in ~500 ns, about 3 orders of magnitude faster than
its intrinsic lifetime. This `catapult' faithfully converts arbitrary cavity
fields to traveling signals with an estimated efficiency of > 90%, enabling
on-demand generation of complex itinerant quantum states. Importantly, the
release process can be controlled precisely on fast time scales, allowing us to
generate entanglement between the cavity and the traveling mode by partial

resistance states rise up from radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations
when the light intensity is strong enough. The theory starts off with the {\it

swinging nature of the radiation-driven Landau states and the presence of
charged impurity scattering. When the intensity of radiation is high enough it
turns out that the driven-Landau states (vibrational states) involved in the
scattering process are spatially far from each other and the corresponding
electron wave functions do not longer overlap. As a result, it takes place a
drastic suppression of the scattering probability and then current and
magnetoresistance exponentially drop. Finally zero resistance states rise up.
This is an application to magnetotransport in two dimensional electron systems
of the Franck-Condon blockade, based on the Franck-Condon physics which in turn

task for quantum applications and the understanding of fundamental phenomena. A
central question is the role of localization in quenching quantum
thermalization, and whether localization survives in the presence of
interactions. The localized phase of interacting systems (many-body
localization, MBL) exhibits a long-time logarithmic growth in entanglement
entropy that distinguishes it from the noninteracting Anderson localization
(AL), but entanglement is difficult to measure experimentally. Here, we present
a novel correlation metric, capable of distinguishing MBL from AL in
high-temperature spin systems. We demonstrate the use of this metric to detect
localization in a natural solidstate spin system using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). We engineer the natural Hamiltonian to controllably introduce
disorder and interactions and observe the emergence of localization. In
particular, while our correlation metric saturates for AL, it keeps increasing
logarithmically for MBL, a behavior reminiscent of entanglement entropy, as we
confirm by simulations. Our results show that our NMR techniques, akin to
measuring out-of-time correlations, are well suited for studying localization

derive a characteristic scale for lensing perturbations and show that this is
significantly larger than the perturber's Einstein radius. We show that the
perturber's projected mass enclosed within this radius, scaled by the log-slope
of the host galaxy's density profile, can be robustly inferred even if the
inferred density profile and tidal radius of the perturber are biased. We
demonstrate the validity of our analytic derivation by using several
gravitational lens simulations where the tidal radii and the inner log-slopes
of the density profile of the perturbing subhalo are allowed to vary. By
modeling these simulated data we find that our mass estimator, which we call
the effective subhalo lensing mass, is accurate to within about 10\% or smaller
in each case, whereas the inferred total subhalo mass can potentially be biased
by nearly an order of magnitude. We therefore recommend that the effective
subhalo lensing mass be reported in future lensing reconstructions, as this

theories defined on circle fibrations like $S^3$ and its lens space family. The
duality is an exchange between the thermal circle and the fiber circle in the
limit where both are small. The conjecture is motivated by the fact that
$\pi_1(S^3/\mathbb{Z}_{p\rightarrow \infty})=\mathbb{Z}=\pi_1(S^1\times S^2)$
and the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $S^3/\mathbb{Z}_{p\rightarrow

Several checks of the conjecture are provided: free fields, $\mathcal{N}=1$
theories in four dimensions (which shows that the Di Pietro-Komargodski
supersymmetric Cardy formula and its generalizations are given exactly by a
supersymmetric Casimir energy), $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at strong

width and in the separation in phase of the main pulse and interpulse. We
perform the analysis with both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

posterior that is extremely efficient in the low signal-to-noise regime and can
be readily applied to a wide range of scientific problems. We apply this
methodology to a series of simulations, and to between seven and nine yr of
observations for PSRs J1713$+$0747, J1744$-$1134, and J1909$-$3744 with
frequency coverage that spans 700-3600MHz. We use a smooth model for profile
evolution across the full frequency range, and compare smooth and piecewise
models for the temporal variations in DM. We find the profile domain framework
consistently results in improved timing precision compared to the standard
analysis paradigm by as much as 40% for timing parameters. Incorporating
smoothness in the DM variations into the model further improves timing
precision by as much as 30%. For PSR J1713+0747 we also detect pulse shape
variation uncorrelated between epochs, which we attribute to variation
intrinsic to the pulsar at a level consistent with previously published

selected from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). Observed H-band
sizes are measured from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic
Legacy Survey (CANDELS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/F160W imaging.
Distributions of individual galaxy masses and sizes illustrate that a clear
mass-size relation exists up to z~7. At z~7, we find that the average galaxy
size from the mass-size relation is more compact at a fixed mass of
log(M*/Msol)=10.1, with r_1/2,maj=1.02+/-0.29 kpc, than at lower redshifts.
This is consistent with our results from stacking the same CANDELS HST/F160W

size evolution of star-forming galaxies is well fit by a power law of the form
r_e = 7.07(1 + z)^-0.89 kpc, which is consistent with previous works for normal
star-formers at 1<z<4. In order to compare our slope with those derived Lyman
break galaxy studies, we correct for different IMFs and methodology and find a
slope of -0.97+/-0.02, which is shallower than that reported for the evolution

magnitudes, an equal-mass black-hole inspiral is uniquely characterized by the
two parameters $(S,\xi)$: these two numbers completely determine the entire
evolution under the effect of radiation reaction. In particular, for equal-mass

molecular clouds (GMCs). Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in
primarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale
fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated
the dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of
GMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on
small scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar
abundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral
gas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are
non-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the
effects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small
charged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio
fluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have
essentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of
dust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can
enhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling
of dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on
grain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order
correction. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three
dimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the
turbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a
dust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to
generalize our simulations to a wide range of conditions.

showing that structure immediately surrounding clusters increases the scatter

Uncorrelated large scale structure along the line of sight leads to an increase
in the \ac{sze} signal and scatter that is more pronounced for low mass

mass dependent scatter that is $\sim0.16$ at low masses. The scatter

photoconductivity when illuminated by circularly polarized light. Unlike Hall
motion arising from a Lorentz force in a magnetic field, which impedes
longitudinal carrier motion, Hall photoconductivity arising from Berry
curvature can boost longitudinal carrier transport. In GDMs, this results in a
helicity-dependent photoresponse in the Hall regime, where photoconductivity is
dominated by its Hall component. We find that the induced Hall conductivity per
incident irradiance is enhanced by up to six orders of magnitude when moving
from the visible regime (with corresponding band gaps) to the far infrared.

performance of such a network depends on the multitude of parameters defining
traffic statistics, network topology/technology, channel characteristics and
business models for multi-operator cooperation. So far, most of these aspects
have been addressed separately in the literature. Since the above parameters
are mutually dependent, and simultaneously present in a network, for a given
channel and traffic statistics, a joint optimization of technology and business
model parameters is required. In this paper, we present such joint models of
complex wireless networks and introduce optimization with parameter clustering
to solve the problem in a tractable way for large number of parameters. By
parameter clustering we compress the optimization vector and significantly
simplify system implementation, hence the algorithm is referred to as
compressed control of wireless networks. Two distinct parameter compression
techniques are introduced mainly parameter absorption and parameter
aggregation. Numerical results obtained in this way demonstrate clear maximum
in the network utility as a function of the network topology parameters. The
results, for a specific network with traffic offloading, show that the
cooperation decisions between the multiple operators will be significantly
influenced by the traffic dynamics. For typical example scenarios, the optimum
offloading price varies by factor 3 for different traffic patterns which
justifies the use of dynamic strategies in the decision process. Besides, if
user availability increases by multi-operator cooperation, network capacity can
be increased up to 50% and network throughput up to 30-40%.

parameters like the molecular gas mass from CO line emission and dust continuum
emission. Then we discuss how those estimates may be affected when applied to
the outskirts, where the average gas density, metallicity, stellar radiation
field, and temperature may be lower. We focus on observations of molecular gas
in the outskirts of the Milky Way, extragalactic disk galaxies, early-type
galaxies, groups, and clusters. The scientific results show the versatility of
molecular gas, as it has been used to trace Milky Way spiral arms out to a
galactocentric radius of 15 kpc, to study star formation in extended
ultraviolet disk galaxies, to probe galaxy interactions in polar ring S0
galaxies, and to investigate ram pressure stripping in clusters. We highlight

observed twice in hard X-rays with the IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL during
the flares of Jan 2009 and Jan 2010, and simultaneously with Swift and NOT, in
addition to the constant Fermi monitoring. The optical polarization was
measured in several bands on 18 Jan 2010 at the NOT. Using our and archival
data we constructed historical light curves at gamma-to-radio wavelengths
covering nearly 20 years and applied variability tests. We assembled SEDs in
2009 and 2010 and compared them with those at two previous epochs and with a
model based on synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) radiation. The SED modeling
suggests that the physical quantities that undergo the largest variations are
the total power injected into the emitting region and the random Lorentz factor
of the electron distribution cooling break, that are higher in the higher
gamma-ray states. This suggests a correlation of the injected power with
enhanced activity of the acceleration mechanism. The cooling likely takes place
at a much smaller distance ($\sim$0.03 pc) than the BLR radius. The emission at
a few hundred GeV can be reproduced with IC scattering of highly relativistic
electrons off FIR photons at $\sim$0.2 pc, presumably in a dusty torus. DCF
analysis between the long-term optical and gamma-ray light curves yields a good
correlation with no measurable delay. Our time analysis of the RXTE PCA and

interest because of the rich phenomena these materials exhibit, including the
coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric orders, magnetodielectric behavior,
and exotic hybrid excitations such as electromagnons. The multiferroic spinel
material, CoCr$_2$O$_4$, is a particularly interesting example of a
multiferroic material, because evidence for magnetoelectric behavior in the
ferrimagnetic phase seems to conflict with traditional noncollinear-spin-driven
mechanisms for inducing a macroscopic polarization. This paper reports an
inelastic light scattering study of the magnon and phonon spectrum of
CoCr$_2$O$_4$ as simultaneous functions of temperature, pressure, and magnetic
field. Below the Curie temperature ($T_C \sim 94$ K) of CoCr$_2$O$_4$ we
observe a $\omega \sim 16 \,\text{cm}^{-1}$ $\boldsymbol q=0$ magnon having
T$_{1g}$-symmetry, which has the transformation properties of an axial vector.
The anomalously large Raman intensity of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon is
characteristic of materials with a large magneto-optical response and likely
arises from large magnetic fluctuations that strongly modulate the dielectric
response in CoCr$_2$O$_4$. The Raman susceptibility of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry
magnon exhibits a strong magnetic-field dependence that is consistent with the
magnetodielectric response observed in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that
magnetodielectric behavior in CoCr$_2$O$_4$ primarily arises from the
field-dependent suppression of magnetic fluctuations that are strongly coupled
to long-wavelength phonons. Increasing the magnetic anisotropy in CoCr$_2$O$_4$
with applied pressure decreases the magnetic field-dependence of the
T$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon Raman susceptibility in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that
strain can be used to control the magnetodielectric response in CoCr$_2$O$_4$.

a spherically symmetric homogeneous mass with constant energy density, shows a
divergence in pressure when the radius of the star reaches the
Schwarzschild-Buchdahl bound. Recently Mazur and Mottola showed that this
divergence is integrable through the Komar formula, inducing non-isotropic
transverse stresses on a surface of some radius $R_{0}$. When this radius
approaches the Schwarzschild radius $R_{s}=2M$, the interior solution becomes
one of negative pressure evoking a de Sitter spacetime. This gravitational
condensate star, or gravastar, is an alternative solution to the idea of a
black hole as the ultimate state of gravitational collapse. Using Hartle's
model to calculate equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating masses, we
report results of surface and integral properties for a Schwarzschild star in
the very little studied region $R_{s}<R<(9/8)R_{s}$. We found that in the
gravastar limit, the angular velocity of the fluid relative to the local
inertial frame tends to zero, indicating rigid rotation. Remarkably, the
normalized moment of inertia $I/MR^2$ and the mass quadrupole moment $Q$
approach to the corresponding values for the Kerr metric to second order in

  Inform. Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the problem of constructing a polar code of block length $N$ for the
transmission over a given channel $W$. Typically this requires to compute the
reliability of all the $N$ synthetic channels and then to include those that
are sufficiently reliable. However, we know from [1], [2] that there is a
partial order among the synthetic channels. Hence, it is natural to ask whether
we can exploit it to reduce the computational burden of the construction
problem.
  We show that, if we take advantage of the partial order [1], [2], we can
construct a polar code by computing the reliability of roughly a fraction
$1/\log^{3/2} N$ of the synthetic channels. In particular, we prove that
$N/\log^{3/2} N$ is a lower bound on the number of synthetic channels to be
considered and such a bound is tight up to a multiplicative factor $\log\log
N$. This set of roughly $N/\log^{3/2} N$ synthetic channels is universal, in
the sense that it allows one to construct polar codes for any $W$, and it can
be identified by solving a maximum matching problem on a bipartite graph.
  Our proof technique consists of reducing the construction problem to the
problem of computing the maximum cardinality of an antichain for a suitable
partially ordered set. As such, this method is general and it can be used to
further improve the complexity of the construction problem in case a new
partial order on the synthetic channels of polar codes is discovered.

has re-emerged as a central focus in artificial intelligence. Representation
learning refers to the discovery of useful encodings of data that make
domain-relevant information explicit. Factorial representations identify
underlying independent causal factors of variation in data. A factorial
representation is compact and faithful, makes the causal factors explicit, and
facilitates human interpretation of data. Factorial representations support a
variety of applications, including the generation of novel examples, indexing
and search, novelty detection, and transfer learning.
  This article surveys various constraints that encourage a learning algorithm
to discover factorial representations. I dichotomize the constraints in terms
of unsupervised and supervised inductive bias. Unsupervised inductive biases
exploit assumptions about the environment, such as the statistical distribution
of factor coefficients, assumptions about the perturbations a factor should be
invariant to (e.g. a representation of an object can be invariant to rotation,
translation or scaling), and assumptions about how factors are combined to
synthesize an observation. Supervised inductive biases are constraints on the
representations based on additional information connected to observations.
Supervisory labels come in variety of types, which vary in how strongly they
constrain the representation, how many factors are labeled, how many
observations are labeled, and whether or not we know the associations between
the constraints and the factors they are related to.
  This survey brings together a wide variety of models that all touch on the
problem of learning factorial representations and lays out a framework for
comparing these models based on the strengths of the underlying supervised and
unsupervised inductive biases.

of the extended system. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we show both to be
supercritical. We extend the primary branches by means of numerical
continuation, and show that they lose stability in pitchfork, transcritical or
Hopf bifurcations. Tracking the corresponding secondary branches reveals an
interval of the viscosity parameter in which up to four stable equilibria and
time-periodic solutions coexist. Since the study of the extended problem is

orbit (ISCO) and examine near--extreme case, where collisions take place near
an event horizon. By fine--tuning the particles' angular momentum, the Lorentz
factor of the collision can always be minimized to a value dependent on the
black hole's spin. We identified that this minimal value is always less than
$\frac{2\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and more than $\frac{\sqrt{12}-1}{\sqrt{6}}$
(the limits are the values for an extreme Kerr and Schwarzschild,
respectively). It implies that this kind of collisions of compact objects are
expected to be highly energetic near supermassive black holes. In addition, we
show that an interaction between black hole's and particle's spins has an
influence on minimal Lorentz factor. This contribution is nonnegligible for
near--extreme black holes. We also discuss the relation between our results and

Models of AGB stars with initial mass above 5$M_{\odot}$ are prolific producers
of $^{26}$Al owing to hot bottom burning (HBB). In contrast, $^{60}$Fe,
$^{107}$Pd, and $^{182}$Hf are produced by neutron captures: $^{107}$Pd and

cloud of solar mass and composition to investigate if it is possible to explain
the abundances of the four radioactive nuclides at the Sun's birth using one
single value of the mixing ratio between the AGB yields and the initial cloud

M_{\odot}$) cannot provide a solution because they produce too little

cannot provide a solution because they produce too little $^{26}$Al relative to

Comparisons of the radio continuum properties between megamaser and non-masing

radio luminosity is statistically significant, i.e. the maser galaxies tend to
have higher radio luminosities by a factor of 2 to 3 than the non-masing ones,

symmetric nonsingular black hole with finite lifetime. Namely, we discuss a
sandwich black-hole model, where a black hole is originally created by a
collapse of a null shell of mass $M$, and later, after some time $\Delta V$, it
is disrupted by the collapse of the other shell with negative mass $-M$. We
assume that between the shells the metric is static and either coincides with
the Hayward metric or with a special generalization of it. We show that in both
cases for sufficiently large parameter $\Delta V$ the radiation after the
formation of the black hole practically coincides with the Hawking result. We
also calculated the radiation, emitted from the black hole interior. This
radiation contains peak at the moment when the second shell intersects the
inner horizon. In the standard sandwich metric (with the Hayward interior) this
outburst of the energy is exponentially large. In the modified metric, which
includes additional non-trivial redshift parameter, this exponent is
suppressed. This is a result of significant decrease of the surface gravity of
the inner horizon in the latter case. We discuss possible consequences of this
result in context of the self-consistency requirement for nonsingular models

occluded shapes. Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response
dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from
prefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may
underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions
based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that
probabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven
solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level
of occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and
feedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about
the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures
key features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC
responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are
less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback
signals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our
study proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with
feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.

two methods for efficiently estimating the parameters of the noise fields from
a prescribed data set. One method directly approximates the time evolution of
the variance of each landmark by a finite set of differential equations, and
the other is based on an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. In the second
method, the evaluation of the data likelihood is achieved without registering
the landmarks, by applying bridge sampling using a stochastically perturbed
version of the large deformation gradient flow algorithm. The method and the
estimation algorithms are experimentally validated on synthetic examples and

of some bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Polarization in the prompt phase spans
a wide range, and may be as high as $\gtrsim 50\%$. In the afterglow phase,
however, it is usually below $10\%$. According to the standard fireball model,
GRBs are produced by synchrotron radiation and Compton scattering process in a
highly relativistic jet ejected from the central engine. It is widely accepted
that prompt emissions occur in the internal shock when shells with different
velocities collide with each other, and the magnetic field advected by the jet
from the central engine can be ordered in large scale. On the other hand,
afterglows are often assumed to occur in the external shock when the jet
collides with interstellar medium, and the magnetic field produced by the shock
through, e.g. Weibel instability, is possibly random. In this paper, we
calculate the polarization properties of the synchrotron self-Compton process
from a highly relativistic jet, in which the magnetic field is randomly
distributed in the shock plane. We also consider the generalized situation
where a uniform magnetic component perpendicular to the shock plane is
superposed on the random magnetic component. We show that, the polarization is
hardly to be larger than $10\%$ if the seed electrons are isotropic in the jet
frame. This may account for the observed upper limit of polarization in the
afterglow phase of GRBs. In addition, if the random and uniform magnetic
components decay with time in different speeds, then the polarization angle may
change $90^{\circ}$ duration the temporal evolution.

results on revealing the growth kinetics of 2D MoS2 via capturing the
nucleation seed, evolution morphology, edge structure and terminations at the
atomic scale during CVD growth using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies. The direct growth
of few- and mono-layer MoS2 onto graphene based TEM grids allow us to perform
the subsequent TEM characterization without any solution-based transfer. Two
forms of seeding centers are observed during characterizations: (i)
Mo-oxysulfide (MoOxS2-y) nanoparticles either in multi-shelled fullerene-like
structures or in compact nanocrystals for the growth of fewer-layer MoS2; (ii)
Mo-S atomic clusters in case of monolayer MoS2. In particular, for the
monolayer case, at the early stage growth, the morphology appears in irregular
polygon shape comprised with two primary edge terminations: S-Mo Klein edge and
Mo zigzag edge, approximately in equal numbers, while as the growth proceeds,
the morphology further evolves into near-triangle shape in which Mo zigzag edge
predominates. Results from density-functional theory calculations are also
consistent with the inferred growth kinetics, and thus supportive to the growth
mechanism we proposed. In general, the growth mechanisms found here should also
be applicable in other 2D materials, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2 etc.

Interestingly, by the affine curvatures, the fractal curves can be quantified

the sources are X-ray binaries (XRBs). Transient SSSs spectra can be fitted

properties are consistent with the widely accepted model for SSSs, an accreting
white dwarf with the steady nuclear burning on its surface, while the SSS
emission has also been observed in many post-nova systems. Detailed analysis of
one sufficiently bright SSS revealed the strong short-term variability,
possibly showing a 2.3 hour periodic modulation, and long-term variability,
detectable over 23 years with different X-ray telescopes before year 2003. The
X-ray properties of four other transients are consistent with neutron star or

likely an XRB with a quasi-soft X-ray spectrum. Analysis of archival {\it

grains evaporate in a hot inner region during the early stage of disk
evolution, and the effects of condensation and evaporation on vertical dust
settling can be significant. A 1-D dust settling model considering both
physical and chemical aspects is presented in this paper. Modeling results show
that dust grains evaporate as they descend into the hotter interior and form a
""condensation front,"" above which dust-composing major elements, Mg, Si, and
Fe, accumulate, creating a large temperature gradient. Repeated evaporation at
the front inhibits grain growth, and small grain sizes elevate the opacity away
from the mid-plane. Self-consistent calculations including radiative heat
transfer and condensation theory suggest that the mid-disk temperature could be
high enough for silicates to remain evaporated longer than previous estimates.
The formation of a condensation front leads to contrasting settling behaviors
between highly refractory elements, such as Al and Ca, and moderately
refractory elements, such as Mg, Si, and Fe, suggesting that elemental
abundance in planetesimals may not be a simple function of volatility.

manipulating the whole image, we propose to learn the corresponding residual

hole horizon, similar to what are the fluid parcels for a classical fluid. We
dub them puncels. Hence, in the fluid limit, the horizon is composed by puncels
which are themselves interpreted as composed (in the sense of the tensor
product) by a large number of more fundamental intertwiners. We study the
spectrum of the euclidean volume acting on puncels and we compute its quantum

the drifting problem. OCT builds upon the reasonable assumption that the
correlation response to the target image follows a Gaussian distribution, which
we exploit to select training samples and reduce model uncertainty. OCT is
rooted in a new theory which transfers data distribution to a constraint of the

the proposed method significantly improves KCF, and achieves better performance

described by a relatively simple model that assumes spherical symmetry,
hydrostatic equilibrium, and entirely thermal pressure support. The joint
analysis yields considerably better constraints on the total mass and
concentration of the cluster compared to analysis of any one dataset
individually. The subsample of five galaxy clusters is used to place an upper
limit on the fraction of pressure support in the intracluster medium (ICM) due
to nonthermal processes, such as turbulence and bulk flow of the gas. We
constrain the nonthermal pressure fraction at r500c to be less than 0.11 at 95
percent confidence. This is in tension with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulations, which predict a nonthermal pressure fraction of approximately 0.25

explained by the sample selection and/or our assumption of spherical symmetry.

units of polymer materials used in organic electronics. To elucidate the effect
of bending of these linear moieties on elementary electronic properties such as
luminescence colour and radiative rate we introduce a series of molecular
polygons. The pi-system in these molecules becomes so distorted in
bichromophores (digons) that these absorb and emit light of arbitrary
polarisation: any part of the chain absorbs and emits radiation with equal
probability. Bending leads to a cancellation of transition dipole moment (TDM),
increasing excited-state lifetime. Simultaneously, fluorescence shifts to the
red as radiative transitions require mixing of the excited state with
vibrational modes. However, strain can become so large that excited-state
localisation on shorter units of the chain occurs, compensating TDM
cancellation. Since these effects counteract, underlying correlations between
shape and photophysics can only be resolved in single molecules.

intermolecular coupling and local-field effects are responsible for a sizable

depth in the bed: this is called intermediate segregation. For the largest S,
large beads migrate to the bottom: this is called reverse segregation (in
contrast with surface segregation). As the reversal and intermediate depth
values depend on the bead fraction, this numerical study mainly uses a single
large tracer. Small fractions are also computed showing the link between a
tracer behavior and segregation process. For half-filled rotating drum and for
rough incline, two and three (3D) dimensional cases are studied. In the
tumbler, trajectories of a large tracer show that it reaches a constant depth
during the flow. For large S, this depth is intermediate with a progressive
sinking when S increases. Largest S correspond to tracers at the bottom of the
flow. All 3D simulation are in quantitative agreement with the experiments. In
the flow down an incline, a large tracer reaches an equilibrium depth during
flow. For large S, its depth is intermediate, inside the bed. For the largest
S, its depth is reverse, near the bottom. Results are slightly different for
thin or thick flow. For 3D thick flows, the reversal between surface and bottom
positions occurs within a short range of S: no tracer stabilizes near
mid-height and two reachable intermediate depth layers exist, below the surface
and above the bottom. For 3D thin flows, all intermediate depths are reachable,
depending on S. The numerical study of larger tracer fractions (5-10%) shows
the 3 segregation patterns (surface, intermediate, reverse) corresponding to
the 3 types of equilibrium depth. The reversal is smoother than for a single
tracer. It happens around S=4.5, in agreement with experiments.

Matching (MWM) problems, on trees and on some special classes of graphs, in the
Online Preemptive and the Incremental Dynamic Graph models. In the {\em Online
Preemptive} model, the edges of a graph are revealed one by one and the
algorithm is required to always maintain a valid matching. On seeing an edge,
the algorithm has to either accept or reject the edge. If accepted, then the
adjacent edges are discarded, and all rejections are permanent. In this model,
the complexity of the problems is settled for deterministic algorithms. Epstein
et al. gave a $5.356$-competitive randomized algorithm for MWM, and also proved
a lower bound of $1.693$ for MCM. The same lower bound applies for MWM.
  In this paper we show that some of the results can be improved in the case of
trees and some special classes of graphs. In the online preemptive model, we
present a $64/33$-competitive (in expectation) randomized algorithm for MCM on
trees.
  Inspired by the above mentioned algorithm for MCM, we present the main result
of the paper, a randomized algorithm for MCM with a ""worst case"" update time of
$O(1)$, in the incremental dynamic graph model, which is $3/2$-approximate (in
expectation) on trees, and $1.8$-approximate (in expectation) on general graphs
with maximum degree $3$. Note that this algorithm works only against an
oblivious adversary. Hence, we derandomize this algorithm, and give a $(3/2 +
\epsilon)$-approximate deterministic algorithm for MCM on trees, with an
amortized update time of $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  We also present a minor result for MWM in the online preemptive model, a
$3$-competitive (in expectation) randomized algorithm on growing trees (where
the input revealed upto any stage is always a tree, i.e. a new edge never
connects two disconnected trees).

revolve around collecting high-statistics neutrino samples and attaining an

detectors, such as JUNO, HyperKamiokande, etc, share the use of a large target
mass, and the need of pushing light collection to the edge for maximal
calorimetric information. Achieving high light collection implies considerable
costs, especially when considering detector masses of several kt. A traditional
strategy to maximize the effective photo-coverage with the minimum number of
PMTs relies on Light Concentrators (LC), such as Winston Cones. In this paper,
the authors introduce a novel concept called Occulting Light Concentrators
(OLC), whereby a traditional LC gets tailored to a conventional PMT, by taking
into account its single-photoelectron collection efficiency profile and thus
occulting the worst performing portion of the photocathode. Thus, the OLC shape
optimization takes into account not only the optical interface of the PMT, but
also the maximization of the PMT detection performances. The light collection
uniformity across the detector is another advantage of the OLC system. By
considering the case of JUNO, we will show OLC capabilities in terms of light
collection and energy resolution.

  Review D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.94.123015",,"astro-ph.IM gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The MICROSCOPE space mission, launched on April 25, 2016, aims to test the
weak equivalence principle (WEP) with a 10^-15 precision. To reach this
performance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially
since the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored
noise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will
be missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly
sampled. Those missing values induce a spectral leakage that significantly
increases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked
for, thereby complicating scientific returns. Recently, we developed an
inpainting algorithm to correct the MICROSCOPE data for missing values. This
code has been integrated in the official MICROSCOPE data processing pipeline
because it enables us to significantly measure an equivalence principle
violation (EPV) signal in a model-independent way, in the inertial satellite
configuration. In this work, we present several improvements to the method that
may allow us now to reach the MICROSCOPE requirements for both inertial and
spin satellite configurations. The main improvement has been obtained using a
prior on the power spectrum of the colored-noise that can be directly derived
from the incomplete data. We show that after reconstructing missing values with
this new algorithm, a least-squares fit may allow us to significantly measure
an EPV signal with a 0.96x10^-15 precision in the inertial mode and 1.2x10^-15
precision in the spin mode. Although, the inpainting method presented in this
paper has been optimized to the MICROSCOPE data, it remains sufficiently
general to be used in the general context of missing data in time series
dominated by an unknown colored-noise. The improved inpainting software, called
ICON, is freely available at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/icon.

analyzed individually. We performed a careful analysis of temperature behavior
of the relaxed superconducting current $J$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films
which revealed two components of the current $J = J_1 +J_2$. A simple method of
separation of the components and their temperature dependence in low magnetic

pinning on the oxygen vacancies in CuO$_2$ planes while $J_2$ is caused by
strong pinning on the Y$_2$O$_3$ precipitates. $J_1$ component weakly changes
with field and quasi-exponentially decays with temperature, disappearing at $T
\simeq 30$--40~K. Rapid relaxation of $J_1$ causes formation of the normalized
relaxation rate peak at $T \simeq 20$~K. $J_2$ component is suppressed by field
as $J_2\propto B^{-0.54}$ and decays with temperature following to the power
law $J_2\propto(1 - T/T_\mathrm{dp} )^\alpha$ where $T_\mathrm{dp}$ is the
depinning temperature. Detailed comparison of the experimental data with

enterprise systems is a challenging task that has led to the study of combining
formalisms from knowledge representation, database theory, and process
management. To ensure system correctness, formal verification also comes into
play and offers well-established techniques. In line with this, significant
results have been obtained within the research on data-aware business processes
(DABP), which studies the marriage between static and dynamic aspects of a
system within a unified framework.
  Here, we investigate the verification of DABP in the presence of ontologies,
and provide the following contributions: (1) We propose a formal framework
called Golog-KABs (GKABs), by leveraging on the state of the art formalisms for
DABP equipped with ontologies. GKABs enable us to specify semantically-rich
DABP, where the system dynamics are specified using a high-level action
language inspired by the Golog programming language. (2) We propose a
parametric execution semantics for GKABs that is able to elegantly accommodate
a plethora of inconsistency-aware semantics based on the well-known notion of
repair, and this leads us to several variants of inconsistency-aware GKABs. (3)
We enhance GKABs towards context-sensitive GKABs. (4) We introduce the
so-called Alternating-GKABs that allow for a more fine-grained analysis over
the systems. (5) We introduce a novel framework called Semantically-Enhanced
Data-Aware Processes (SEDAPs) that, by utilizing ontologies, enable us to have
a high-level conceptual view over the evolution of the underlying system.
  We also provide reductions for the verification of sophisticated first-order
temporal properties over all of the settings above, and show that verification
can be addressed using existing techniques developed for Data-Centric Dynamic
Systems (a well-established DABP framework).

of their eigenvalues $\{\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_N\}$. We study the
distribution of truncated linear statistics of the form $\tilde{L}=\sum_{i=1}^p
f(\lambda_i)$ with $p<N$. This problem has been considered by us in a previous
paper when the $p$ eigenvalues are further constrained to be the largest ones
(or the smallest). In this second paper we consider the same problem without
this restriction which leads to a rather different analysis. We introduce a new
ensemble which is related, but not equivalent, to the ""thinned ensembles""
introduced by Bohigas and Pato. This question is motivated by the study of
partial sums of proper time delays in chaotic quantum dots, which are
characteristic times of the scattering process. Using the Coulomb gas
technique, we derive the large deviation function for $\tilde{L}$. Large
deviations of linear statistics $L=\sum_{i=1}^N f(\lambda_i)$ are usually
dominated by the energy of the Coulomb gas, which scales as $\sim N^2$,
implying that the relative fluctuations are of order $1/N$. For the truncated
linear statistics considered here, there is a whole region (including the
typical fluctuations region), where the energy of the Coulomb gas is frozen and
the large deviation function is purely controlled by an entropic effect.
Because the entropy scales as $\sim N$, the relative fluctuations are of order
$1/\sqrt{N}$. Our analysis relies on the mapping on a problem of $p$ fictitious
non-interacting fermions in $N$ energy levels, which can exhibit both positive
and negative effective (absolute) temperatures. We determine the large
deviation function characterizing the distribution of the truncated linear
statistics, and show that, for the case considered here
($f(\lambda)=1/\lambda$), the corresponding phase diagram is separated in three
different phases.

in perturbative QCD. Next, the produced partons hadronize in a non-perturbative
way later in a hadronization process. The jet fragmentation can be studied
using the method of two particle correlations. A useful observable is the jet
transverse fragmentation momentum $j_{\mathrm{T}}$, which describes the angular

the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks
raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent

quark-gluon plasma and radiates gluons due to its interactions with the medium.
Within perturbative QCD, this evolution can be described as a stochastic
branching process, that we have managed to solve exactly. We present exact,
analytic, results for the gluon spectrum (the average gluon distribution) and
for the higher n-point functions, which describe correlations and fluctuations.
Using these results, we construct the event-by-event picture of the gluon
distribution produced via medium-induced gluon branching. In contrast to what
happens in a usual QCD cascade in vacuum, the medium-induced branchings are
quasi-democratic, with offspring gluons carrying sizable fractions of the
energy of their parent parton. We find large fluctuations in the energy loss
and in the multiplicity of soft gluons. The multiplicity distribution is
predicted to exhibit KNO (Koba-Nielsen-Olesen) scaling. These predictions can
be tested in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, via event-by-event measurements of
the di-jet asymmetry.

under synchronization constraints, for example, for applications such as
MapReduce, multipath transmission and RAID systems. Arriving jobs are first
split into tasks and mapped to servers for execution, such that a job can only
leave the system when all of its tasks are executed.
  In this paper, we provide computable stochastic bounds for the waiting and
response time distributions for heterogeneous FJ systems under general
parallelization benefit. Our main contribution is a generalized mathematical
framework for probabilistic server scheduling strategies that are essentially
characterized by a probability distribution over the number of utilized
servers, and the optimization thereof. We highlight the trade-off between the
scaling benefit due to parallelization and the FJ inherent synchronization
penalty. Further, we provide optimal scheduling strategies for arbitrary
scaling regimes that map to different levels of parallelization benefit. One
notable insight obtained from our results is that different applications with
varying parallelization benefits result in different optimal strategies.
Finally, we complement our analytical results by applying them to various
applications showing the optimality of the proposed scheduling strategies.

we have carried out a multipoint analysis of small transient structures
released from a north-south tilted helmet streamer into the slow solar wind

Combining the remote-sensing observations taken by the Solar-TErrestrial

of such small transient structures (often called blobs), which subsequently
move away from the Sun, is associated with the concomitant formation of
transient structures collapsing back towards the Sun; the latter have been
referred to by previous authors as raining inflows. This is the first direct
association between outflowing blobs and raining inflows, which locates the
formation of blobs above the helmet streamers and gives strong support that the
blobs are released by magnetic reconnection.

In this note we prove that this really is the case, in a precise mathematical
sense: a sequence whose asymptotic distribution of pair correlations is
Poissonian must necessarily be equidistributed. Furthermore, for sequences

network (HCN) avoids frequent information passage from content providers to the
network edge, thereby reducing latency and alleviating traffic congestion in
backhaul links. In general, the optimal strategies for content placement in
HCNs remain largely unknown and deriving them forms the theme of this paper. To
this end, we adopt the popular random HCN model where $K$ tiers of BSs are
modelled as independent Poisson point processes distributed in the plane with
different densities. Further, the random caching scheme is considered where
each of a given set of $M$ files with corresponding popularity measures is
placed at each BS of a particular tier with a corresponding probability, called
placement probability. The probabilities are identical for all BSs in the same
tier but vary over tiers, giving the name tier-level content placement. We
consider the network performance metric, hit probability, defined as the
probability that a file requested by the typical user is delivered successfully
to the user. We maximize the hit probability over content placement
probabilities, which yields the optimal tier-level placement policies. For the
case of uniform received signal-to-interference thresholds for successful
transmissions for BSs in different tiers, the policy is in closed-form where
the placement probability for a particular file is proportional to the
square-root of the corresponding popularity measure with an offset depending on
BS caching capacities. For the general case of non-uniform SIR thresholds, the
optimization problem is non-convex and a sub-optimal placement policy is
designed by approximation, which has a similar structure as in the case of
uniform SIR thresholds and shown by simulation to be close-to-optimal.

attention due to their ability to enhance polysaccharide depolymerization,
making them interesting in respect to production of biofuel from cellulose. The
LPMOs are metalloenzymes that contain a mononuclear copper active site that can
active dioxygen. However, many details of this activation are unclear, and have
previously been investigated from a computational angle. Yet, these studies
have either employed only molecular mechanics (MM), which are inaccurate for
metal active sites, or they have described only the active site with quantum
mechanics (QM) and neglected the effect of the protein. Here, we employ hybrid
QM and MM (QM/MM) methods to investigate the first steps of the LPMO mechanism,
which is reduction of of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and formation of a Cu(II)-superoxide
complex. In the latter complex, the superoxide can bind either in an equatorial
or an axial position. For both steps we obtain structures that are markedly
different from previous suggestions, based on vacuum calculations. Our
calculations show that the equatorial isomer of the superoxide complex is over
60 kJ/mol more stable than the axial isomer, being stabilized by interactions
with a second-coordination-sphere Gln residue, showing a possible role for this
residue. Coordination of superoxide in this manner is in agreement with recent
experimental suggestions.

of sustained harmonic walking. This report aims to establish whether the micro-
and macro-features of walking identified in the laboratory and free-living
environments are associated with measures of physical function, mobility,
fatigability, and fitness.
  Methods. Fifty-one older adults (median age 77.5) enrolled in the
Developmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were
included in the analyses. The study included an in-the-lab component as well as
7 days of monitoring in-the-wild. Participants were equipped with hip-worn
Actigraph GT3X+ activity monitors, which collect high-density raw accelerometry
data. We applied a walking identification algorithm to the data and defined
features of walking, such as participant-specific walking acceleration and
cadence. The association between these walking features and physical function,
mobility, fatigability, and fitness was quantified using linear regression
analysis.
  Results. Micro-scale features of walking (acceleration and cadence) estimated
from in-the-lab and in-the-wild data were associated with measures of physical
function, mobility, fatigability, and fitness. In-the-lab median walking
acceleration was strongly inversely associated with physical function,
mobility, fatigability and fitness. Additionally, in-the-wild daily walking
time was inversely associated with usual- and fast-paced 400m walking time.
  Conclusions. The proposed accelerometry-derived walking features are
significantly associated with measures of physical function, mobility,
fatigability, and fitness, which provides evidence of convergent validity.

direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas

translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health
monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of
low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning
provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data.
The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research
work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief
introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in
machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following
aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and
its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines
(DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are
discussed.

provide another way to approach the Sylvester's Four-Point Problem as we show

resolves in the affirmative the infinite case, involving stabilization and

neutral particle analyzers (NPA) and thermal neutron detection. The main
purpose of this detector is to provide a state-of-the-art solution for detector
system of NPAs for the ITER experimental reactor and to be used in combination
with a Boron conversion layer for the detection of thermal neutrons. Currently
the NPAs are using very thin scintillator - photomultiplier tube, and their
main drawbacks are poor energy resolution, intrinsic scintillation
nonlinearity, relative low count rate capability and finally poor signal to
background discrimination power for the low energy channels. The proposed
U3DTHIN detector is based on very thin sensitive substrate which will provide
nearly 100% detection efficiency for ions and at the same time very low
sensitivity for the neutron and gamma radiation. To achieve a very fast charge
collection of the carriers generated by the ions detection a 3D electrode
structure[5] has been introduced in the sensitive volume of the detector. One
of the most innovative features of these detectors has been the optimal
combination of the thin entrance window and the sensitive substrate thickness,
to accommodate very large energy dynamic range of the detected ions. An
entrance window with a thickness of tens of nanometers together with a
sensitive substrate thickness varying from less than 5 microns, to detect the
lowest energetic ions to 20 microns for the height ones has been selected after
simulations with GEANT4. To increase the signal to background ratio the
detector will operate in spectroscopy regime allowing to perform pulse-height
analysis. The technology used to fabricate these 3D ultra thin detectors
