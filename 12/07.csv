by generalizing the micromagnetic equations of motion to a finite-temperature
path integral formalism, using field theoretic tools. Promoting the center of
the Skyrmion to a dynamic quantity, the fluctuations around the Skyrmionic
configuration give rise to a time-dependent damping of the Skyrmion motion.
From the frequency dependence of the damping kernel, we are able to identify
the Skyrmion mass, thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic
properties of Skyrmions. When defects are present or a magnetic trap is
applied, the Skyrmion mass acquires a finite value proportional to the
effective spin, even at vanishingly small temperature. We demonstrate that a
Skyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a
massive particle owing to its quasi-one-dimensional confinement. An additional
quantum mass term is predicted, independent of the effective spin, with an
explicit temperature dependence which remains finite even at zero temperature.

response and energy loss function of these materials in two ways: a full ab
initio approach, in which we carry out time-dependent density functional
simulations in linear response for different momentum transfers, and a
semi-classical model, based on the Drude--Lorentz extension to finite momenta
of the optical dielectric function. Ab initio calculated dielectric functions
lead to a better agreement with electron energy loss measured spectra with
respect the widely used Drude-Lorentz model. This discrepancy is particularly
evident for insulators and semiconductors beyond the optical limit ($\mathbf{q}
\neq 0$), where single particle excitations become relevant. Furthermore, we
show that the behaviour of the energy loss function at different accuracy
levels has a dramatic effect on other physical observables, such as the
inelastic mean free path and the stopping power in the low energy regime ($<
100$ eV) and thus on the accuracy of MC simulations.

Layer (TTL), the region just below the high ($\sim$18 km), cold tropical
tropopause, remains an outstanding question in atmospheric science. Moisture
transport to this region is important for climate projections because it drives
the formation of local cirrus (ice) clouds, which have a disproportionate
impact on the Earth's radiative balance. Deep cumulus towers carrying large
volumes of ice are known to reach the TTL, but their importance to the water
budget has been debated for several decades. We show here that profiles of the
isotopic composition of water vapor can provide a quantitative estimate of the
convective contribution to TTL moistening. Isotopic measurements from the ACE
satellite instrument, in conjunction with ice loads inferred from CALIOP
satellite measurements and simple mass-balance modeling, suggest that
convection is the dominant source of water vapor in the TTL up to
near-tropopause altitudes. The relatively large ice loads inferred from CALIOP
satellite measurements can be produced only with significant water sources, and
isotopic profiles imply that these sources are predominantly convective ice.
Sublimating ice from deep convection appears to increase TTL cirrus by a factor
of several over that expected if cirrus production were driven only by
large-scale uplift; sensitivity analysis implies that these conclusions are
robust for most physically reasonable assumptions. Changes in tropical deep
convection in future warmer conditions may thus provide an important climate
feedback.

establish that, with each node employing an identical one-bit quantizer for
local information exchange, a novel consensus reaching approach can achieve the
optimal asymptotic performance of centralized detection as the network size
scales. The statement is true under three different detection frameworks: the
Bayesian criterion where the maximum a posteriori detector is optimal, the
Neyman-Pearson criterion with a constant type-I error probability constraint,
and the Neyman-Pearson criterion with an exponential type-I error probability
constraint. Leveraging recent development in distributed consensus reaching
using bounded quantizers with possibly unbounded data (which are log-likelihood
ratios of local observations in the context of distributed detection), we
design a one-bit deterministic quantizer with controllable threshold that leads
to desirable consensus error bounds. The obtained bounds are key to
establishing the optimal asymptotic detection performance. In addition, we
examine non-asymptotic performance of the proposed approach, and show that the
type-I and type-II error probabilities at each node can be made arbitrarily

QCD. Employing the Mobius domain-wall fermions, we generate gauge
configurations slightly above the critical temperature Tc with different
lattice sizes L = 2-4 fm. Our action allows frequent topology tunneling while
keeping good chiral symmetry close enough to that of overlap fermions. This
allows us to recover full chiral symmetry by an overlap/domain-wall
reweighting. Above the phase transition, a strong suppression of the low-lying
modes is observed in both of overlap and domain-wall Dirac spectra. We,
however, find a sizable violation of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation in the Mobius
domain-wall Dirac eigenmodes, which dominates the signals of the axial U(1)
symmetry breaking near the chiral limit. We also find that the use of overlap
fermion only in the valence sector is dangerous since it suffers from the
artifacts due to partial quenching. Reweighting the Mobius domain-wall fermion
determinant to that of the overlap fermion, we observe the axial U(1) breaking
to vanish in the chiral limit, which is stable against the changes of the
lattice volume and lattice spacing.

heterogeneous environments, rapidly gaining knowledge about the local
environment is key to the evolutionary success of a migrating population. For
historical human migration, environmental heterogeneity was naturally
asymmetric in the north-south (NS) and east-west (EW) directions. We here
consider the human migration process in the Americas, modeled as random,
asymmetric, modularly correlated environments. Knowledge about the environments
determines the fitness of each individual. We present a phase diagram for
asymmetry of migration as a function of carrying capacity and fitness
threshold. We find that the speed of migration is proportional to the inverse
complement of the spatial environmental gradient, and in particular we find
that north-south migration rates are lower than east-west migration rates when
the environmental gradient is higher in the north-south direction.
Communication of knowledge between individuals can help to spread beneficial
knowledge within the population. The speed of migration increases when
communication transmits pieces of knowledge that contribute in a modular way to
the fitness of individuals. The results for the dependence of migration rate on
asymmetry and modularity are consistent with existing archaeological
observations. The results for asymmetry of genetic divergence are consistent
with patterns of human gene flow.

component in the spectra, possibly associated with synchrotron radiation. We
aim at describing the spatial distribution of the physical properties of the
X-ray emitting plasma and at revealing the effects of the interaction of the
remnant with the inhomogeneous ambient medium. We also aim at investigating the
origin of the gamma-ray emission, which may be Inverse Compton radiation
associated with X-ray synchrotron emitting electrons or hadronic emission
originating from the impact of high energy protons on the nearby clouds. We
analyzed an XMM-Newton EPIC observation of Kes 78 by performing image analysis
and spatially resolved spectral analysis on a set of three regions. We tested
our findings against the observations of the 12CO and 13CO emission in the
environment of the remnant. We revealed the complex X-ray morphology of Kes 78
and found variations of the spectral properties of the plasma, with
significantly denser and cooler material at the eastern edge of the remnant,
which we interpret as a signature of interaction with a molecular cloud. We
also exclude the presence of narrow filaments emitting X-ray synchrotron
radiation. Assuming that the very high energy gamma-ray emission is associated
with Kes 78, the lack of synchrotron emission rules out a leptonic origin. A
hadronic origin is further supported by evidence for interaction of the remnant

years, major advances in the manipulation and control of phonons have
highlighted their potential as carriers of quantum information in quantum
technologies, particularly in quantum processing and quantum communication.
Although most of these studies have focused on trapped ion and crystalline
systems, another promising system that has remained relatively unexplored is
BECs. The potential benefits in using this system have been emphasized recently
with proposals of relativistic quantum devices that exploit quantum states of
phonons in BECs to achieve, in principle, superior performance over standard
non-relativistic devices. Quantum decoherence is often the limiting factor in
the practical realization of quantum technologies, but here we show that
quantum decoherence of phonons is not expected to heavily constrain the
performance of these proposed relativistic quantum devices.

effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation. CORAL minimizes domain
shift by aligning the second-order statistics of source and target
distributions, without requiring any target labels. In contrast to subspace
manifold methods, it aligns the original feature distributions of the source
and target domains, rather than the bases of lower-dimensional subspaces. It is
also much simpler than other distribution matching methods. CORAL performs
remarkably well in extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets. We
first describe a solution that applies a linear transformation to source
features to align them with target features before classifier training. For
linear classifiers, we propose to equivalently apply CORAL to the classifier
weights, leading to added efficiency when the number of classifiers is small
but the number and dimensionality of target examples are very high. The
resulting CORAL Linear Discriminant Analysis (CORAL-LDA) outperforms LDA by a
large margin on standard domain adaptation benchmarks. Finally, we extend CORAL
to learn a nonlinear transformation that aligns correlations of layer
activations in deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting Deep CORAL approach
works seamlessly with DNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
standard benchmark datasets. Our code is available

A particle and a cluster, as well as two clusters, irreversibly aggregate
whenever they become nearest neighbors. Nonequilibrium stationary phases appear
under the balance of injection and ejection of particles. By extensive Monte
Carlo simulations it is established that the phase diagram in the plane of the
injection-ejection probabilities consists of three stationary phases: a
multi-particle (MP) one, a completely filled (CF) phase and a 'mixed' (MP+CF)
one. The transitions between these phases are: an unusual transition between MP
and CF with jump discontinuity in both the bulk density and the current, a
conventional first-order transition with a jump in the bulk density between MP
and MP+CF, and a continuous clustering-type transition from MP to CF, which
takes place throughout the MP+CF phase between them. By the data collapse
method a finite-size scaling function for the current and bulk density is
obtained near the unusual phase transition line. A diverging correlation length
associated with that transition is identified and interpreted as the size of
the largest cluster. The model allows for a future extension to account for

the center-to-limb curve of the average of the parameter's absolute values
measured from the disk passage of a large number of ARs and normalized to each
AR's absolute value of the parameter at central meridian, gives the average
fractional projection error at each radial distance from disk center. To
demonstrate the method, we use a large set of large-flux ARs and apply the
method to a whole-AR parameter that is among the simplest to measure: whole-AR
magnetic flux. We measure 30,845 SDO/HMI vector magnetograms covering the disk
passage of 272 large-flux ARs, each having whole-AR flux >1022 Mx. We obtain
the center-to-limb radial-distance run of the average projection error in

30,845 normalized measured values. The average projection error in the measured
whole-AR flux of an AR at a given radial distance is removed by multiplying the
measured flux by the correction factor given by the fit. The correction is
important for both the study of evolution of ARs and for improving the accuracy
of forecasting an AR's major flare/CME productivity.

investigate such electronic dynamics, we have recently developed equations of
motion (EOM) for the apparent solvent polarization charges that generate the
reaction field in the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) for solvation and we

Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction (TD CI) description of the solute

solvent Debye relaxation after an electronic excitation of the solute obtained
either by a $\pi$ pulse of light or by assuming the idealized sudden promotion
to the excited state. Moreover, we present EOM for the Onsager solvation model

decompose spectral data cubes into separate bulge and disk components, subject
only to the constraint that they reproduce the conventional photometric
decomposition. These decompositions allow us to study the kinematic and stellar
population properties of the individual components and how they vary with
position, in order to assess their plausibility as discrete elements, and to
start to reconstruct their distinct formation histories. An initial application
of this method to CALIFA integral field unit observations of three isolated S0
galaxies confirms that in regions where both bulge and disc contribute
significantly to the flux they can be physically and robustly decomposed into a
rotating dispersion-dominated bulge component, and a rotating low-dispersion
disc component. Analysis of the resulting stellar populations shows that the
bulges of these galaxies have a range of ages relative to their discs,
indicating that a variety of processes are necessary to describe their
evolution. This simple test case indicates the broad potential for extracting
from spectral data cubes the full spectral data of a wide variety of individual
galaxy components, and for using such decompositions to understand the
interplay between these various structures, and hence how such systems formed.

an abnormal field dependence of flux-flow resistivity is in contrast with the

under the assumption that quantum corrections are approximately local across
energy scales. We apply our analysis to the test case of phonon mediated
superconductivity and show the consistency of both the Eliashberg and RG

points and find a transition between superconductivity and a ""naked"" metallic
quantum critical point with finite, critical BCS couplings. We speculate on the

(sigma) for HII Galaxies provides a powerful method to measure the distances to

spectrophotometry to explore the systematics of the correlation using the
[OIII]5007 lines instead of Halpha or Hbeta to measure luminosities and line
widths. We also examine possible systematic effects involved in measuring the
profile-widths and the luminosities through different apertures. We find that
the green L-sigma relation defined using [OIII]5007 luminosities is
significantly more sensitive than Hbeta to the effects of age and the physical
conditions of the nebulae, which more than offsets the advantage of the higher
strength of the [OIII]5007 lines. We then explore the possibility of mixing
[OIII]5007 profile-widths with SDSS Hbeta luminosities using the Hubble
constant H0 to quantify the possible systematic effects. We find the mixed
L(Hbeta) sigma[OIII] relation to be at least as powerful as the canonical
L-sigma relation as a distance estimator, and we show that the evolutionary
corrections do not change the slope and the scatter of the correlation, and
therefore, do not bias the L-sigma distance indicator at high redshifts.
Locally, however, the luminosities of the Giant HII Regions that provide the
zero-point calibrators are sensitive to evolutionary corrections and may bias
the Hubble constant if their mean ages, as measured by the equivalent widths of
Hbeta, are significantly different from the mean age of the HII Galaxies. Using
a small sample of 16 ad-hoc zero point calibrators we obtain a value of H0 =
66.4\pm4.5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for the Hubble constant, which is fully consistent
with the best modern determinations, and that is not biased by evolutionary
corrections.

general distortion function when the observation vector is received through a
linear system with additive white Gaussian noise. The analysis considers the
system matrix to be chosen from the large class of rotationally invariant
random matrices. We take a statistical mechanical approach by introducing a
spin glass corresponding to the estimator, and employing the replica method for
the large-system analysis. In contrast to earlier replica based studies, our
analysis evaluates the general replica ansatz of the corresponding spin glass
and determines the asymptotic distortion of the estimator for any structure of
the replica correlation matrix. Consequently, the replica symmetric as well as
the Replica Symmetry (RS) breaking ansatz with $b$ steps of breaking is deduced
from the given general replica ansatz. The generality of our distortion
function lets us derive a more general form of the MAP decoupling principle.
Based on the general replica ansatz, we show that for any structure of the
replica correlation matrix, the vector-valued system decouples into a bank of
equivalent decoupled linear systems followed by MAP estimators. The structure
of the decoupled linear system is further studied under both the RS and the
Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) assumptions. For $b$ steps of RSB, the
decoupled system is found to be an additive system with a noise term given as
the sum of an independent Gaussian random variable with $b$ correlated
impairment terms. As an application of our study, we investigate large

explained in the context of the primordial disk misalignment model, in which an
initially aligned protoplanetary disk is torqued by a distant stellar companion
on a misaligned orbit, resulting in a precessional motion that can lead to
large-amplitude oscillations of the spin--orbit angle. We consider a variant of
this model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a
few au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the
dynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer
parts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,
rigid disks. We show that the planet misaligns the inner disk even as the
orientation of the outer disk remains unchanged. In addition to the
oscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the
smaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also
exhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from
the disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum
drops below that of the planet. Altogether, these two effects can produce
significant misalignment angles for the inner disk, including retrograde
configurations. We discuss these results within the framework of the Stranded
Hot Jupiter scenario and consider their implications, including to the
interpretation of the alignment properties of debris disks.

= 0.00986) Seyfert 2 galaxy. We discover extended ($\sim$1 kpc) X-ray emission
in the soft band (0.5 - 2 keV) that is neither coincident with the narrow line
region nor the extended radio emission. Based on spectral modeling, it is
linked to on-going star formation ($\sim$2.6-4 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$). The soft
emission at circumnuclear scales (inner $\sim$400 pc) originates from hot gas,
with kT $\sim$ 0.7 keV, while the most extended thermal emission is cooler (kT
$\sim$ 0.3 keV). We refine previous measurements of the extreme Fe K$\alpha$
equivalent width in this source (EW = 2.5$^{+2.6}_{-1.0}$ keV), which suggests
the central engine is completely embedded within Compton-thick levels of
obscuration. Using physically motivated models fit to the Chandra spectrum, we
derive a Compton-thick column density ($N_{\rm H} > 1.25\times10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$) and an intrinsic hard (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosity of
$\sim$3-8$\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (depending on the presumed geometry of
the obscurer), which is over two orders of magnitude larger than that observed.
The large Fe K$\alpha$ EW suggests a spherical covering geometry, which could
be confirmed with X-ray measurements above 10 keV. NGC 4968 is similar to other
active galaxies that exhibit extreme Fe K$\alpha$ EWs (i.e., $>$2 keV) in that
they also contain ongoing star formation. This work supports the idea that gas
associated with nuclear star formation may increase the covering factor of the
enshrouding gas and play a role in obscuring AGN.

spectra, with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) instrument on
XMM-Newton maintaining the highest ""figure of merit"" at soft X-ray energies for
all missions flying or currently planned for the next decade. Thanks to its
even higher spectral resolution, the use of Chandra-High Energy Transmission

sample of 365 nearly face-on star-forming galaxies observed by MaNGA, we
demonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impacts the measurements of
emission line ratios, hence the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams and
gas-phase metallicity measurements. At fixed metallicity, DIG-dominated low
H\alpha\ surface brightness regions display enhanced [SII]/H\alpha,
[NII]/H\alpha, [OII]/H\beta, and [OI]/H\alpha. The gradients in these line
ratios are determined by metallicity gradients and H\alpha\ surface brightness.
In line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves HII regions
towards composite or LI(N)ER-like regions. A harder ionizing spectrum is needed
to explain DIG line ratios. Leaky HII region models can only shift line ratios
slightly relative to HII region models, and thus fail to explain the
composite/LI(N)ER line ratios displayed by DIG. Our result favors ionization by
evolved stars as a major ionization source for DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission.
  DIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity
gradients derived using strong-line methods. Metallicities derived using N2O2
are optimal because they exhibit the smallest bias and error. Using O3N2, R23,
N2=[NII]/H\alpha, and N2S2H\alpha\ (Dopita et al. 2016) to derive metallicities
introduces bias in the derived metallicity gradients as large as the gradient
itself. The strong-line method of Blanc et al. (2015; IZI hereafter) cannot be
applied to DIG to get an accurate metallicity because it currently contains
only HII region models which fail to describe the DIG.

massive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history
of the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using
the ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative
enrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]
probes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,
including younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time
mergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we
must study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which
[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with
[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by
stacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average
[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use
of index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors
that are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at
even earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full
spectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern
shortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement
of [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11,
this galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice
the Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the
galaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae
and with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are
similar to population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past SFR of
600-3000 Msol/yr, this galaxy was among the most vigorous star-forming galaxies

dynamically hide the gravitational slip on all scales whenever the propagation
of gravitational waves is modified. Horndeski models are much more flexible,
but it is nonetheless only possible to hide gravitational slip dynamically when
the action for perturbations is tuned to evolve in time toward a divergent
kinetic term. These results provide an explicit, theoretical argument for the

localizes sources with a level of accuracy comparable for all four

ranging from 25.1$^{\circ}$ to 30.3$^{\circ}$. This is a reasonable accuracy in
the two-detector case, and is comparable to accuracies of other localization
methods studied previously. As BW reconstructs generic transient signals with
sine-Gaussian wavelets, it is unsurprising that BW performs the best in
reconstructing sine-Gaussian and Gaussian waveforms. BW's accuracy in waveform
reconstruction increases steeply with network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$_{\rm

of waveforms is only limited by statistical errors in the frequency domain, and
is affected by systematic errors too in the time domain as BW cannot

We describe the impurity using Abrikosov pseudo-fermions, and define an

a CFT fermion. At large $N$ the Kondo interaction is of the form
$\mathcal{O}^{\dagger} \mathcal{O}$, which is marginally relevant, and

critical temperature, leading to the Kondo effect, including screening of the
impurity. Via holography, the phase transition is dual to holographic
superconductivity in $(1+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. At all
temperatures, spectral functions of $\mathcal{O}$ exhibit a Fano resonance,

ejecta and pre-existing, slower circumstellar material (CSM) constitute an
interesting, diverse, and still poorly understood category of explosive
transients. The chief reason that they are extremely interesting is because
they tell us that in a subset of stellar deaths, the progenitor star may become
wildly unstable in the years, decades, or centuries before explosion. This is
something that has not been included in standard stellar evolution models, but
may significantly change the end product and yield of that evolution, and
complicates our attempts to map SNe to their progenitors. Another reason they
are interesting is because CSM interaction is an efficient engine for making
bright transients, allowing super-luminous transients to arise from normal SN
explosion energies, and allowing transients of normal SN luminosities to arise
from sub-energetic explosions or low radioactivity yield. CSM interaction
shrouds the fast ejecta in bright shock emission, obscuring our normal view of
the underlying explosion, and the radiation hydrodynamics of the interaction is
challenging to model. The CSM interaction may also be highly non-spherical,
perhaps linked to binary interaction in the progenitor system. In some cases,
these complications make it difficult to definitively tell the difference
between a core-collapse or thermonuclear explosion, or to discern between a
non-terminal eruption, failed SN, or weak SN. Efforts to uncover the physical
parameters of individual events and connections to possible progenitor stars
make this a rapidly evolving topic that continues to challenge paradigms of

extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics which provide viable dark
matter candidates. Direct and indirect dark matter searches rely on inputs of
astrophysical nature, such as the local dark matter density or the shape of the
dark matter profile in the target in object. The determination of these
quantities is highly affected by astrophysical uncertainties. The latter,
especially those for our own Galaxy, are ill-known, and often not fully
accounted for when analyzing the phenomenology of particle physics models. In
this paper we present a systematic, quantitative estimate of how astrophysical
uncertainties on Galactic quantities (such as the local galactocentric
distance, circular velocity, or the morphology of the stellar disk and bulge)
propagate to the determination of the phenomenology of particle physics models,
thus eventually affecting the determination of new physics parameters. We
present results in the context of two specific extensions of the Standard Model
(the Singlet Scalar and the Inert Doublet) that we adopt as case studies for
their simplicity in illustrating the magnitude and impact of such uncertainties
on the parameter space of the particle physics model itself. Our findings point
toward very relevant effects of current Galactic uncertainties on the
determination of particle physics parameters, and urge a systematic estimate of
such uncertainties in more complex scenarios, in order to achieve constraints
on the determination of new physics that realistically include all known
uncertainties.

SN2005ip's H-alpha luminosity and other observed characteristics were nearly
identical to those of the radio-luminous SN1988Z, and much more luminous than
SNe1993J and 1998S. At 10 yr after explosion, SN2005ip showed a drop in
H$\alpha$ luminosity, followed by a quick resurgence over several months. We
interpret this variability as ejecta crashing into a dense shell located at
around 0.05 pc from the star, which may be the same shell that caused the IR

SN1988Z are still dominated by the forward shock at 10 yr post-explosion,
whereas SN1993J and SN1998S are dominated by the reverse shock at a similar

enhanced mass loss for about 1e3 yr before core collapse, longer than Ne, O, or

magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the gravitational collapse of one solar
mass, rotating, perturbed molecular cloud cores. Alongside the role of Ohmic
resistivity, ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect, we also examine the
effects of magnetic field strength, orientation and amplitude of the density
perturbation. When modelling sub-critical cores, ideal MHD models do not
collapse whereas non-ideal MHD models collapse to form single protostars. In
super-critical ideal MHD models, increasing the magnetic field strength or
decreasing the initial density perturbation amplitude decreases the initial
binary separation. Strong magnetic fields initially perpendicular to the
rotation axis suppress the formation of binaries and yield discs with magnetic
fields ~10 times stronger than if the magnetic field was initially aligned with
the rotation axis. When non-ideal MHD is included, the resulting discs are
larger and more massive, and the binary forms on a wider orbit. Small
differences in the super-critical cores caused by non-ideal MHD effects are
amplified by the binary interaction near periastron. Overall, the non-ideal
effects have only a small impact on binary formation and early evolution, with
the initial conditions playing the dominant role.

to strong velocity-blending of spectral lines. The temperature and column

21-SPONGE survey at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array using AGD. We find more
components per line of sight in 21-SPONGE than in synthetic spectra, which
reflects insufficient simulated gas scale heights and the limitations of local
box simulations. In addition, we find a significant population of low-optical
depth, broad absorption components in the synthetic data which are not seen in
21-SPONGE. This population is not obvious in integrated or per-channel

min (0.060761584(10) days), making it the second-most compact sdB binary known.
The lightcurve shows ellipsoidal variations. Under the assumption that the sdB
primary is synchronized with the orbit, we find a mass $M_{\rm

  The future evolution was calculated using the MESA stellar evolution code.
Adopting a canonical sdB mass of $M_{\rm sdB}=0.47$ M$_\odot$, we find that the
sdB still burns helium at the time it will fill its Roche lobe if the orbital
period was less than 106 min at the exit from the last common envelope phase.
For longer common envelope exit periods the sdB will have stopped burning
helium and turned into a C/O white dwarf at the time of contact. Comparing the
spectroscopically derived log(g) and $T_{\rm eff}$ with our MESA models, we
find that an sdB model with a hydrogen envelope mass of $5\times10^{-4}

corresponding to a post-common envelope orbital period of 109 min which is
close to the limit to start accretion while the sdB is still burning helium.

admit a perturbative solution in the derivative expansion, there are at least
two independent superinvariants at the eight-derivative order of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. Assuming the twelve-superforms associated to
certain anomalous Chern-Simons terms are Weil-trivial, there will be a third
independent superinvariant at this order. Under certain conditions, at least
two superinvariants will survive to all orders in the derivative expansion.
However only one of them will be present in the quantum theory: the
supersymmetrization of the Chern-Simons terms of eleven dimensional
supergravity required for the cancellation of the M5-brane gravitational
anomaly by inflow. This superinvariant can be shown to be unique at the
eight-derivative order, assuming it is quartic in the fields. On the other
hand, a necessary condition for the superinvariant to be quartic is the
exactness, in tau-cohomology, of X0,8 -the purely spinorial component of the
eight-superform related by descent to the M5-brane anomaly polynomial. In that
case it can also be shown that the solution of the Weil-triviality condition of
the corresponding twelve-form, which is a prerequisite for the explicit
construction of the superinvariant, is guaranteed to exist. We prove that
certain highly non-trivial necessary conditions for the tau-exactness of X0,8
are satisfied. Moreover any potential superinvariant associated to anomalous
Chern-Simons terms at the eight-derivative order must necessarily contain terms

frequency array (LOFAR) and the square kilometre array (SKA), formed of a large
number of small and flexible elementary antennas, has led to significant
challenges. Among them, model calibration is a crucial step in order to provide
accurate and thus meaningful images and requires the estimation of all the
perturbation effects introduced along the signal propagation path, for a
specific source direction and antenna position. Usually, it is common to
perform model calibration using the a priori knowledge regarding a small number
of known strong calibrator sources but under the assumption of Gaussianity of
the noise. Nevertheless, observations in the context of radio astronomy are
known to be affected by the presence of outliers which are due to several
causes, e.g., weak non-calibrator sources or man made radio frequency
interferences. Consequently, the classical Gaussian noise assumption is
violated leading to severe degradation in performances. In order to take into
account the outlier effects, we assume that the noise follows a spherically
invariant random distribution. Based on this modeling, a robust calibration
algorithm is presented in this paper. More precisely, this new scheme is based
on the design of an iterative relaxed concentrated maximum likelihood
estimation procedure which allows to obtain closed-form expressions for the
unknown parameters with a reasonable computational cost. This is of importance
as the number of estimated parameters depends on the number of antenna
elements, which is large for the new generation of radio interferometers.
Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art calibration techniques.

confidence sets for a parameter of interest. This second type of impossibility
(type B) occurs under a condition weaker than the condition for type A
impossibility: the parameter of interest must be nearly unidentified. Our
theoretical framework connects many existing publications on impossible
inference that rely on different notions of topologies to show models are not
distinguishable or nearly unidentified. We also derive both types of
impossibility using the weak topology induced by convergence in distribution.
Impossibility in the weak topology is often easier to prove, it is applicable
for many widely-used tests, and it is useful for robust hypothesis testing. We
conclude by demonstrating impossible inference in multiple economic
applications of models with discontinuity and time-series models.

good-$\lambda$-embedding if, whenever $x,y\in M$, $x\ne y$ implies
$d(x,y)\le\Vert f(x)-f(y)\Vert$ and, for each $n$, $Lip(f_n)<\lambda$, where
$Lip(f_n)$ denotes the Lipschitz constant of $f_n$. We prove that there exists
a good-$\lambda$-embedding from $M$ into $c_0$ if and only if $M$ satisfies an
internal property called $\pi(\lambda)$. As a consequence, we obtain that for
any separable metric space $M$, there exists a good-$2$-embedding from $M$ into
$c_0$. These statements slightly extend former results obtained by N. Kalton
and G. Lancien, with simplified proofs.

  Zweizig","Upper Limits on the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background from
  Advanced LIGO's First Observing Run","13 pages, 6 figures","Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 121101 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.121101",,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources are expected to
contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Following the
observations of GW150914 and GW151226, the rate and mass of coalescing binary
black holes appear to be greater than many previous expectations. As a result,
the stochastic background from unresolved compact binary coalescences is
expected to be particularly loud. We perform a search for the isotropic
stochastic gravitational-wave background using data from Advanced LIGO's first
observing run. The data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave
signal. We constrain the dimensionless energy density of gravitational waves to
be $\Omega_0<1.7\times 10^{-7}$ with 95% confidence, assuming a flat energy
density spectrum in the most sensitive part of the LIGO band (20-86 Hz). This
is a factor of ~33 times more sensitive than previous measurements. We also
constrain arbitrary power-law spectra. Finally, we investigate the implications
of this search for the background of binary black holes using an astrophysical
model for the background.

stochastic background expected from a variety of contributing mechanisms and
test the assumption of isotropy using data from Advanced LIGO's first observing
run. We also search for persistent gravitational waves from point sources with
only minimal assumptions over the 20 - 1726 Hz frequency band. Finding no
evidence of gravitational waves from either point sources or a stochastic
background, we set limits at 90% confidence. For broadband point sources, we
report upper limits on the gravitational wave energy flux per unit frequency in
the range $F_{\alpha,\Theta}(f) < (0.1 - 56) \times 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ (f/25 Hz)$^{\alpha-1}$ depending on the sky location
$\Theta$ and the spectral power index $\alpha$. For extended sources, we report
upper limits on the fractional gravitational wave energy density required to
close the Universe of $\Omega(f,\Theta) < (0.39-7.6) \times 10^{-8}$ sr$^{-1}$
(f/25 Hz)$^\alpha$ depending on $\Theta$ and $\alpha$. Directed searches for
narrowband gravitational waves from astrophysically interesting objects
(Scorpius X-1, Supernova 1987 A, and the Galactic Center) yield median
frequency-dependent limits on strain amplitude of $h_0 <$ (6.7, 5.5, and 7.0)
$\times 10^{-25}$ respectively, at the most sensitive detector frequencies
between 130 - 175 Hz. This represents a mean improvement of a factor of 2
across the band compared to previous searches of this kind for these sky
locations, considering the different quantities of strain constrained in each
case.

  to the mid-infrared regime",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.94.063402",,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We apply the Monte Carlo Wave Packet (MCWP) approach to investigate the
kinetic energy release (KER) spectra of the protons following double ionization
in H$_{2}$ when interacting with laser pulses with central wavelengths ranging
from the near-IR (800 nm) to the mid-IR (6400 nm) regions and with durations of
3-21 laser cycles. We uncover the physical origins of the peaks in the nuclear
KER spectra and ascribe them to mechanisms such as ionization following a
resonant dipole transition, charge-resonance-enhanced ionization (CREI) and
ionization in the dissociative limit of large internuclear distances. For
relatively large pulse durations, i.e., for 15 or more laser cycles at 3200 nm
and 10 or more at 6400 nm, it is possible for the nuclear wave packet in
H$_{2}^{+}$ to reach very large separations. Ionization of this part of the
wave packet results in peaks in the KER spectra with very low energies. These
peaks give direct information about the dissociative energy in the
$2p\sigma_{u}$ potential energy curve of H$_{2}^{+}$ at the one- and
three-photon resonances between the $2p\sigma_{u}$ and $1s\sigma_{g}$ curves in
H$_{2}^{+}$. With the MCWP approach, we perform a trajectory analysis of the
contributions to the KER peaks and identify the dominant ionization pathways.
Finally, we consider a pump-probe scheme by applying two delayed pulses to
track the nuclear dynamics in a time-resolved setting. Low-energy peaks appear
for large delays and these are used to obtain the $2p\sigma_{u}$ dissociative
energy values at the one-photon resonance between the $2p\sigma_{u}$ and
$1s\sigma_{g}$ curves in H$_{2}^{+}$ for different wavelengths.

necessary condition for the global hypoellipticity of the pseudo-differential
operator $L=D_t+(a+ib)(t)P(D_x)$ on $\mathbb{T}^1_t\times\mathbb{T}_x^{N}$.
This condition is also sufficient when the symbol $p(\xi)$ of $P(D_x)$ has at
most logarithmic growth. If $p(\xi)$ has super-logarithmic growth, we show that
the global hypoellipticity of $L$ depends on the change of sign of certain
interactions of the coefficients with the symbol $p(\xi).$ Moreover, the
interplay between the order of vanishing of coefficients with the order of
growth of $p(\xi)$ plays a crucial role in the global hypoellipticity of $L$.
We also describe completely the global hypoellipticity of $L$ in the case where
$P(D_x)$ is positively homogeneous. Additionally, we explore the influence of
irrational approximations of a real number in the global hypoellipticity.

application areas of current interest, such as algorithmic game theory, and
allow for improved optimization algorithms. It is natural to ask (e.g., in the
context of data driven optimization) how robust such properties are, and
whether small deviations from them can be tolerated. We consider two such
questions in the important special case of linear set functions.
  One question that we address is whether any set function that approximately
satisfies the modularity equation (linear functions satisfy the modularity
equation exactly) is close to a linear function. The answer to this is positive
(in a precise formal sense) as shown by Kalton and Roberts [1983] (and further
improved by Bondarenko, Prymak, and Radchenko [2013]). We revisit their proof
idea that is based on expander graphs, and provide significantly stronger upper
bounds by combining it with new techniques. Furthermore, we provide improved
lower bounds for this problem.
  Another question that we address is that of how to learn a linear function
$h$ that is close to an approximately linear function $f$, while querying the
value of $f$ on only a small number of sets. We present a deterministic
algorithm that makes only linearly many (in the number of items) nonadaptive
queries, by this improving over a previous algorithm of Chierichetti, Das,
Dasgupta and Kumar [2015] that is randomized and makes more than a quadratic
number of queries. Our learning algorithm is based on a Hadamard transform.

host, many mycobacteriophages share little or no genetic similarity (i.e.
similarity in their GC contents and codon utilization patterns). Arguing
correctly that efficient translation of a phage's proteins within a host is
likely to be optimized by the phage's ability to match the host's codon usage
pattern, it is concluded that the preferred host of many mycobacteriophages is
not Mycobacterium smegmatis, despite their having been isolated on that
organism. Thus, a virus and its elusive preferred hosts would have had similar
GC percentages and codon usages, but the same virus could still infect a
less-preferred host (Mycobacterium smegmatis), where the virus-host similarity
would be less evident. However, there is another evolutionary interpretation.

background dynamics and cosmological perturbations are generated by a
$k$-essence scalar field with an arbitrary sound speed. When the sound speed is
small, the curvature perturbation is enhanced, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
which is excessively large in the original model, can be sufficiently
suppressed to be consistent with observational bounds. Then, we study the
primordial three-point correlation function generated during the
matter-dominated contraction stage and find that it only depends on the sound
speed parameter. Similar to the canonical case, the shape of the bispectrum is
mainly dominated by a local form, though for some specific sound speed values a
new shape emerges and the scaling behaviour changes. Meanwhile, a small sound
speed also results in a large amplitude of non-Gaussianities, which is
disfavored by current observations. As a result, it does not seem possible to
suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio without amplifying the production of
non-Gaussianities beyond current observational constraints (and vice versa).
This suggests an extension of the previously conjectured no-go theorem in
single field nonsingular matter bounce cosmologies, which rules out a large
class of models. However, the non-Gaussianity results remain as a
distinguishable signature of matter bounce cosmology and have the potential to
be detected by observations in the near future.

conceptual difficulties, we take a different approach and define error and

theory, avoiding many of the conceptual difficulties of usual definitions. We
then derive new Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for both joint

finite-dimensional systems, as well as for the case of position and momentum.
Our relations may be directly applied in information processing settings, for
example to infer that devices which can faithfully transmit information
regarding one observable do not leak any information about conjugate
observables to the environment. We also show that Englert's wave-particle
duality relation [PRL 77, 2154 (1996)] can be viewed as an error-disturbance
uncertainty relation.

high-order spatial discretization and an implicit and adaptive time

between particles with high accuracy. Yet, for dense suspensions, very small

discretization points are required to avoid non-physical contact and
intersections between particles, leading to infinite forces and numerical
instability.
  Our method maintains the accuracy of previous methods at a significantly
lower cost for dense suspensions. The key idea is to ensure interference-free
configuration by introducing explicit contact constraints into the system.
While such constraints are unnecessary in the formulation, in the discrete form
of the problem, they make it possible to eliminate catastrophic loss of
accuracy by preventing contact explicitly.
  Introducing contact constraints results in a significant increase in stable

putting them into an overarching physical context of coarse-graining over an

quantifying brain microstructure as occurring along the three major avenues.
The first avenue focusses on the transient, or time-dependent, effects in
diffusion. These effects signify the gradual coarse-graining of tissue
structure, which occurs qualitatively differently in different brain tissue
compartments. We show that studying the transient effects has the potential to
quantify the relevant length scales for neuronal tissue, such as the packing
correlation length for neuronal fibers, the degree of neuronal beading, and
compartment sizes. The second avenue corresponds to the long-time limit, when
the observed signal can be approximated as a sum of multiple non-exchanging
anisotropic Gaussian components. Here the challenge lies in parameter
estimation and in resolving its hidden degeneracies. The third avenue employs
multiple diffusion encoding techniques, able to access information not
contained in the conventional diffusion propagator. We conclude with our
outlook on the future directions which can open exciting possibilities for
designing quantitative markers of tissue physiology and pathology, based on
methods of studying mesoscopic transport in disordered systems.

given that we have multiple devices within range, which relay(s) do we use for
PHY cooperation, to maintain a consistent target performance? How can we
efficiently adapt, as network conditions change? And how important is it, in
terms of performance, to adapt? Although adapting to the best path when routing
is a well understood problem, how to do so over PHY cooperation networks is an
open question. Our contributions are: (1) We demonstrate via theoretical
evaluation, a diminishing returns trend as the number of deployed relays
increases. (2) Using a simple algorithm based on network metrics, we
efficiently select the sub-network to use at any given time to maintain a
target reliability. (3) When streaming video from Netflix, we experimentally

liquid and subject to an applied uniform electric field exhibit a wide range of

which hypothesizes charge accumulation on the drop-fluid interface and
prescribes a balance between charge relaxation, the jump in Ohmic currents from
the bulk and charge convection by the interfacial fluid flow. Most previous
numerical simulations based on this model have either neglected interfacial
charge convection or restricted themselves to axisymmetric drops. In this work,
we develop a three-dimensional boundary element method for the complete leaky
dielectric model to systematically study the deformation and dynamics of liquid
drops in electric fields. The inclusion of charge convection in our simulations
permits us to investigate drops in the Quincke regime, in which experiments
have demonstrated a symmetry-breaking bifurcation leading to steady

Telescope of Hinode. The flare triggers the eruption of a dense cool plasma
blob as seen in AIA 171\AA,\, which is unable to completely break out and
remains confined within a local bundle of active region loops. During this
process, transverse oscillations of the threads are observed. The cool plasma
is then observed to descend back to the chromosphere along each loop strand. At
the same time, a larger diffuse co-spatial loop observed in the hot wavebands

along its length. The formation and evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

concerns the theory when restricted to the case where all the semi-strongly
self-absorbing actions are assumed to be unitarily regular, which is a mild

  Secondly, we establish completely new results within the theory. This mainly
concerns how equivariantly $\cal Z$-stable absorption can be reduced to
equivariantly UHF-stable absorption with respect to a given semi-strongly

theorems due to Matui and Izumi-Matui, we obtain the following main result. If
$G$ is a torsion-free abelian group and $\cal D$ is one of the known strongly
self-absorbing C*-algebras, then strongly outer $G$-actions on $\cal D$ are
unique up to (very strong) cocycle conjugacy. This is new even for

large in some directions but relatively thin in other directions. In this
scenario we typically expect the system to have emergent structures that vary
slowly over the large dimensions. For practical mathematical modelling of such
systems we require efficient and accurate methodologies for reducing the
dimension of the original system and extracting the emergent dynamics. Common
mathematical approximations for determining the emergent dynamics often rely on
self-consistency arguments or limits as the aspect ratio of the 'large' and
'thin' dimensions becomes unphysically infinite. Here we build on a new
approach, previously establish for systems which are large in only one
dimension, which analyses the dynamics at each cross-section of the domain with
a rigorous multivariate Taylor series. Then centre manifold theory supports the
local modelling of the system's emergent dynamics with coupling to neighbouring
cross-sections treated as a non-autonomous forcing. The union over all
cross-sections then provides powerful support for the existence and emergence
of a centre manifold model global in the large finite domain. Quantitative
error estimates are determined from the interactions between the cross-section
coupling and both fast and slow dynamics. Two examples provide practical
details of our methodology. The approach developed here may be used to quantify
the accuracy of known approximations, to extend such approximations to mixed
order modelling, and to open previously intractable modelling issues to new
tools and insights.

time-fractional stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative noise, which
arises from the consideration of heat transport in porous media with thermal
memory with random effects. The spatial and temporal regularity properties of
mild solution to the given problem under certain sufficient conditions are
obtained. Numerical techniques are developed by the standard Galerkin finite

spontaneous emission in a thermophotovoltaic device is investigated.
Fluctuational electrodynamics is used to calculate external luminescence from a
photovoltaic cell as a function of emitter type, vacuum gap thickness between
emitter and cell, and cell thickness. The observed changes in external
luminescence suggest strong modifications of photon recycling caused by the
presence of the emitter. Photon recycling for propagating modes is affected by
reflection at the vacuum-emitter interface and is substantially decreased by
the leakage towards the emitter through tunneling of frustrated modes. In
addition, spontaneous emission by the cell can be strongly enhanced by the
presence of an emitter supporting surface polariton modes. It follows that
using a radiative recombination model with a spatially uniform radiative
lifetime, even corrected by a photon recycling factor, is inappropriate.
Applying the principles of detailed balance, and accounting for non-radiative
recombination mechanisms, the impact of external luminescence enhancement in
the near field on thermophotovoltaic performance is investigated. It is shown
that unlike isolated cells, the external luminescence efficiency is not solely
dependent on cell quality, but significantly increases as the vacuum gap
thickness decreases below 400 nm for the case of an intrinsic silicon emitter.
In turn, the open-circuit voltage and power density benefit from this enhanced
external luminescence toward the emitter. This benefit is larger as cell
quality, characterized by the contribution of non-radiative recombination,
decreases.

several studies have explored what the limits of the telescope will be in terms
of exoplanet characterization, less has been done to specifically identify
which observing modes will be most useful for characterizing a diverse range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. We use an information content based approach commonly
used in the studies of Solar System atmospheres. We develop a system based upon
these information content methods to trace the instrumental and atmospheric
model phase space in order to identify which observing modes are best suited
for particular classes of planets, focusing on transmission spectra.
Specifically, the atmospheric parameter space we cover is T=600-1800 K,
C/O=0.55-1, [M/H]=1-100$\times$Solar for a R=1.39 R$_J$, M=0.59 M$_J$ planet

over multiple modes is preferred over higher precision in a single mode given
the same amount of observing time. Regardless of the planet temperature and
composition, the best modes for constraining terminator temperatures, C/O
ratios, and metalicity are NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. If the target's host star
is dim enough such that the NIRSpec prism can be used, then it cam be used
instead of NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. Lastly, observations that use more than
two modes, should be carefully analyzed because sometimes the addition of a
third mode results in no gain of information. In these cases, higher precision

Value-at-Risk (VaR) problems in short- and long-horizon Markov decision
processes (MDPs) with two reward functions, which share the same expectations.
Firstly we show that with VaR objective, when the real reward function is
transition-based (with respect to action and both current and next states), the
simplified (state-based, with respect to action and current state only) reward
function will change the VaR. Secondly, for long-horizon MDPs, we estimate the
VaR function with the aid of spectral theory and the central limit theorem.
Thirdly, since the estimation method is for a Markov reward process with the
reward function on current state only, we present a transformation algorithm
for the Markov reward process with the reward function on current and next

homogeneous average effect across different subpopulations. The proposed tests
are based on two-step Kaplan-Meier integrals and do not rely on parametric

proposed tests are consistent against fixed alternatives, and can detect
nonparametric alternatives converging to the null at the parametric
$n^{-1/2}$-rate, $n$ being the sample size. Critical values are computed with
the assistance of a multiplier bootstrap. The finite sample properties of the

Newtonian continuum mechanics coupled with electro-dynamics. The model is able
to describe the behavior of moving elasto-plastic dielectric solids as well as
viscous and inviscid fluids in the presence of electro-magnetic fields. It is
actually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids
are treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved
by introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equations of the
distortion matrix. The model also contains a hyperbolic formulation of heat
conduction as well as a dissipative source term in the evolution equations for
the electric field given by Ohm's law. Via formal asymptotic analysis we show
that in the stiff limit, the governing first order hyperbolic PDE system with
relaxation source terms tends asymptotically to the well-known viscous and
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The governing PDE system is
symmetric hyperbolic and satisfies the first and second principle of
thermodynamics, hence it belongs to the so-called class of symmetric hyperbolic
thermodynamically compatible systems (HTC). An important feature of the
proposed model is that the propagation speeds of all physical processes,
including dissipative processes, are finite. The model is discretized using
high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes
with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter and using high order ADER-WENO
finite volume schemes. We show numerical test problems that explore a rather
large parameter space of the model ranging from ideal MHD, viscous and
resistive MHD over pure electro-dynamics to moving dielectric elastic solids in
a magnetic field.

Taurus. The $\Psi$ function in Taurus has a scale-free trend with a similar
exponent as the correlation function at small scale. It extends almost 3
decades up to $\sim 60$ kAU showing a potential extended wide binary regime.
This was hidden in the correlation function due to the clustering pattern
blending. Distinguishing two stellar populations, single stars versus multiple
systems (separation $ \leq 1$ kAU), within Class II/III stars observed at high
angular resolution, we highlight a major spatial neighborhood difference
between the two populations using nearest-neighbor statistics. The multiple
systems are three times more likely to have a distant companion within 10 kAU

probable physical ultra-wide pairs. These UWPs are biased towards high
multiplicity and higher-stellar-mass components at shorter separations. The
multiplicity fraction per ultra-wide pair with separation less than 10 kAU may
be as high as 83.5 $\pm$ 19.6\%. We suggest that these young pre-main sequence

Lloyd's algorithm, proposed in 1957, is still possibly the most widely used
clustering algorithm in practice due to its simplicity and empirical
performance. However, there has been little theoretical investigation on the
statistical and computational guarantees of Lloyd's algorithm. This paper is an
attempt to bridge this gap between practice and theory. We investigate the
performance of Lloyd's algorithm on clustering sub-Gaussian mixtures. Under an
appropriate initialization for labels or centers, we show that Lloyd's
algorithm converges to an exponentially small clustering error after an order
of $\log n$ iterations, where $n$ is the sample size. The error rate is shown
to be minimax optimal. For the two-mixture case, we only require the
initializer to be slightly better than random guess.
  In addition, we extend the Lloyd's algorithm and its analysis to community
detection and crowdsourcing, two problems that have received a lot of attention
recently in statistics and machine learning. Two variants of Lloyd's algorithm
are proposed respectively for community detection and crowdsourcing. On the
theoretical side, we provide statistical and computational guarantees of the
two algorithms, and the results improve upon some previous signal-to-noise
ratio conditions in literature for both problems. Experimental results on

and mathematical crystallography, refers to the property of a flexible periodic
bar-and-joint framework to widen, rather than shrink, when stretched in some
direction. The only known algorithmic solution for detecting infinitesimal
auxeticity is based on the rather heavy machinery of fixed-dimension
semi-definite programming. In this paper we present a new, simpler algorithmic
approach which is applicable to a natural family of 3D periodic bar-and-joint
frameworks with 3 degrees-of-freedom. This class includes most zeolite
structures, which are important for applications in computational materials
science. We show that the existence of auxetic deformations is related to
properties of an associated elliptic curve. A fast algorithm for recognizing
auxetic capabilities is obtained via the classical Aronhold invariants of the
cubic form defining the curve.

weak supervision in the form of image labels which specify the object classes

following three aspects of EM: (i) initialization; (ii) latent posterior
estimation (E-step) and (iii) the parameter update (M-step). We show that
saliency and attention maps, our bottom-up and top-down cues respectively, of
simple images provide very good cues to learn an initialization for the
EM-based algorithm. Intuitively, we show that before trying to learn to segment
complex images, it is much easier and highly effective to first learn to
segment a set of simple images and then move towards the complex ones. Next, in
order to update the parameters, we propose minimizing the combination of the
standard softmax loss and the KL divergence between the true latent posterior
and the likelihood given by the CNN. We argue that this combination is more
robust to wrong predictions made by the expectation step of the EM method. We
support this argument with empirical and visual results. Extensive experiments

requires only image-level labels; and (iii) consistently outperforms other
weakly-supervised state-of-the-art methods with a very high margin on the

electromagnetism, resulting in a phenomenon known as anisotropic cosmic

dark matter is ultralight axions that carry a coupling to photon, its adiabatic
density fluctuations will induce anisotropic cosmic birefringence with a
blue-tilted rotation power spectrum, thus generating CMB $B$-mode polarization
on sub-degree angular scales. Using current POLARBEAR and SPTPol $B$-mode

silicate dust temperatures which are the major source of uncertainties in
estimating the crystalline-to-amorphous silicate mass ratio. With a Pearson
correlation coefficient of ~0.24, we find that the silicate crystallinities and

been microscopi- cally calculated for even-even fissioning systems.
Calculations in the case of odd nuclei have been performed merely within a
so-called equal-filling approximation (EFA) as opposed to an approach taking
explicitly into account the time reversal breaking properties at the mean field
level- and for only one single-particle configuration.
  Purpose: We study the dependence of the fission barriers on various relevant
configurations (e.g. to evaluate the so-called specialization energy). Besides,
we want to assess the relevance as a func- tion of the deformation of the EFA
approach which has been already found out at ground state deformation.
  Methods: Calculations within the Hartree-Fock plus BCS with self-consistent
particle blocking have been performed using the SkM* Skyrme effective
interaction in the particle-hole channel and a seniority force in the
particle-particle channel. Axial symmetry has been imposed throughout the whole
fission path while the intrinsic parity symmetry has been allowed to be broken
in the outer fission barrier region.
  Results: Potential energy curves have been determined for six different
configurations in U-235 and four in Pu-239. Inner and outer fission barriers
have been calculated along with some spectroscopic properties in the fission
isomeric well. These results have been compared with available data. The
influence of time-reversal breaking mean fields on the solutions has been
investigated.
  Conclusions: A sizeable configuration dependence of the fission barrier
(width and height) has been demonstrated. A reasonable agreement with available
systematic evaluations of fission barrier heights has been found. The EFA
approach has been validated at the large elongations occurring at the outer
barrier region.

short-ranged due to thermal screening, whereas the transverse component remains
long-ranged because of local gauge invariance. The transverse gauge interaction
leads to singular corrections to the fermion self-energy and thus results in an
unusual renormalization of the fermion velocity. We calculate the renormalized

degenerated parametric oscillator cavity and a driven two-level atom coupled to
a waveguide could decay to a pure dark state rather than the expected mixed
state. The calculations are carried out analytically in a low dimensional
Hilbert space truncated at the double-excitation states of the combined system.
The validity of the truncation is confirmed by the exact numerical analysis. It
is found that one way to produce the pure state is to chirally couple the
cavity and the atom to the waveguide. Another way to produce the pure state is
to drive the cavity and the atom with unequal detunings. In both cases, if the
driving fields are weak, the produced state is a coherent superposition of only
the single-excitation and ground states of the combined system. In addition, we
have found a direct correspondence between the generation of the dark state and
the photon blockade effect. In other words, the generation of the dark state
acts as a blockade to the number of photons so that only a single photon can be
present in the cavity. We investigate the normalized second-order correlation
function of the cavity field and find that the conditions under which the
correlation function vanishes coincide with the conditions for the creation of
the pure dark state. This system is, therefore, suggested as an alternative
scheme for the generation of single-photon states.

Furthermore, the few-body values for the contact are well within the range of
values determined in the literature for the many-body system. In the limit of
large spin polarization, we obtain a similar accuracy for the polaron energy,

recognition based on the voxelized shape of an object. In this paper, we
present a 3D-CNN based method to learn distinct local geometric features of
interest within an object. In this context, the voxelized representation may
not be sufficient to capture the distinguishing information about such local
features. To enable efficient learning, we augment the voxel data with surface
normals of the object boundary. We then train a 3D-CNN with this augmented data
and identify the local features critical for decision-making using 3D
gradient-weighted class activation maps. An application of this feature
identification framework is to recognize difficult-to-manufacture drilled hole
features in a complex CAD geometry. The framework can be extended to identify
difficult-to-manufacture features at multiple spatial scales leading to a
real-time decision support system for design for manufacturability.

of {\em irrationally}-related drive frequencies, and the evolution occurs in
response to a built-in effective ""electric"" field, whose components are
proportional to the corresponding drive frequencies. The mapping allows to
engineer and study temporal analogs of many real-space phenomena. Here we focus
on the specific example of a two-level system under two-frequency drive that
induces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2D Floquet space. The
observable consequence of such construction is quantized pumping of energy
between the sources with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. When the system

frequency~($\omega$). For a short duration of the pulse the condition for LR is
not satisfied. In this case, it was shown by a model and particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 123401 (2006)] that electrons absorb laser
energy by anharmonic resonance (AHR) when the position-dependent frequency
$\Omega[r(t)]$ of an electron in the self-consistent anharmonic potential of
the cluster satisfies $\Omega[r(t)]=\omega$. However, AHR remains to be a
debate and still obscure in multi-particle plasma simulations. Here, we
identify AHR mechanism in a laser driven cluster using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. By analyzing the trajectory of each MD electron and extracting its
$\Omega[r(t)]$ in the self-generated anharmonic plasma potential it is found
that electron is outer ionized {\em only} when AHR is met. An anharmonic
oscillator model, introduced here, brings out most of the features of MD
electrons while passing the AHR. Thus, we not only bridge the gap between PIC
simulations, analytical models and MD calculations for the first time but also
unequivocally prove that AHR processes is a universal dominant collisionless
mechanism of absorption in the short pulse regime or in the early time of

non-overlapping cameras in crowds.Re-identification in crowded scenes is a
challenging problem due to large number of people and frequent occlusions,
coupled with changes in their appearance due to different properties and
exposure of cameras. To solve this problem, we model multiple Personal, Social
and Environmental (PSE) constraints on human motion across cameras. The
personal constraints include appearance and preferred speed of each individual
assumed to be similar across the non-overlapping cameras. The social influences
(constraints) are quadratic in nature, i.e. occur between pairs of individuals,
and modeled through grouping and collision avoidance. Finally, the
environmental constraints capture the transition probabilities between gates
(entrances / exits) in different cameras, defined as multi-modal distributions
of transition time and destination between all pairs of gates. We incorporate
these constraints into an energy minimization framework for solving human
re-identification. Assigning $1-1$ correspondence while modeling PSE
constraints is NP-hard. We present a stochastic local search algorithm to
restrict the search space of hypotheses, and obtain $1-1$ solution in the
presence of linear and quadratic PSE constraints. Moreover, we present an
alternate optimization using Frank-Wolfe algorithm that solves the convex
approximation of the objective function with linear relaxation on binary
variables, and yields an order of magnitude speed up over stochastic local
search with minor drop in performance. We evaluate our approach using
Cumulative Matching Curves as well $1-1$ assignment on several thousand frames

the validation of the continuous family of eigenpairs $\{\lambda_i(y;\epsilon),
u_i(y;\epsilon)\}_{i=1}^n$ of $f_x(h_\epsilon(y),y,\epsilon)$ over the slow
manifold $S_\epsilon = \{x = h_\epsilon(y)\}$ admitting the graph
representation. In order to obtain such a family, we apply the interval
Newton-like method with rigorous numerics. The validated family of eigenvectors
generates a vector bundle over $S_\epsilon$ determining normally hyperbolic
eigendirections rigorously. The generated vector bundle enables us to construct
a tubular neighborhood centered at slow manifolds with explicit radii.
Combining rate conditions for providing smoothness of center-(un)stable
manifolds, we can validate smooth tubular neighborhoods with diffeomorphic
family of affine change of coordinates, as well as several extensions such as
conic and star-shaped neighborhoods. Our procedure provides a systematic
construction of smooth neighborhoods of slow manifolds in an explicit range
$[0,\epsilon_0]$ of $\epsilon$ with rigorous numerics.

concentrate on long--lived active longitudes separated by 180 degrees. The
activity shifts between these two longitudes, the ""flip-flop"" events, have been
observed in single stars like FK Comae and binary stars like $\sigma$
Geminorum. Recently, interferometry has revealed that ellipticity may at least
partly explain the ""flip-flop"" events in $\sigma$ Geminorum. This idea was
supported by the double peaked shape of the long--term mean light curve of this
star. Here, we show that the long--term mean light curves of fourteen
chromospherically active binaries follow a general model which explains the
connection betweenm orbital motion, starspot distribution changes, ellipticity
and \flip ~events. Surface differential rotation is probably weak in these
stars, because the interference of two constant period waves may explain the
observed light curve changes. These two constant periods are the active
longitude period $(P_{\mathrm{act}})$ and the orbital period
$(P_{\mathrm{orb}})$. We also show how to apply the same model to single stars,
where only the value of $P_{\mathrm{act}}$ is known. Finally, we present a
tentative interference hypothesis about the origin of magnetic fields in all
spectral types of stars.

same limited range of vision and moving asynchronously in the plane. This task
consists in getting them in finite time within each other's range of vision.
The agents execute the same deterministic algorithm and are assumed to have a
compass showing the cardinal directions as well as a unit measure. On the other
hand, they do not share any global coordinates system (like GPS), cannot
communicate and have distinct labels. Each agent knows its label but does not
know the label of the other agent or the initial position of the other agent
relative to its own. The route of an agent is a sequence of segments that are
subsequently traversed in order to achieve approach. For each agent, the
computation of its route depends only on its algorithm and its label. An
adversary chooses the initial positions of both agents in the plane and
controls the way each of them moves along every segment of the routes, in
particular by arbitrarily varying the speeds of the agents. A deterministic
approach algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that always allows two agents
with any distinct labels to solve the task of approach regardless of the
choices and the behavior of the adversary. The cost of a complete execution of
an approach algorithm is the length of both parts of route travelled by the
agents until approach is completed. Let $\Delta$ and $l$ be the initial
distance separating the agents and the length of the shortest label,
respectively. Assuming that $\Delta$ and $l$ are unknown to both agents, does
there exist a deterministic approach algorithm always working at a cost that is
polynomial in $\Delta$ and $l$? In this paper, we provide a positive answer to
the above question by designing such an algorithm.

equations, on networks. The temporal growth of the lack of information about
the system is captured by its non-equilibrium entropy, defined via the
transition probabilities between different nodes of the network. We derive a
relation between the entropy and the spectrum of the master equation's transfer
matrix. Our findings indicate that the temporal growth of the entropy is
proportional to the logarithm of time if the spectral density shows scaling. In
analogy to chaos theory, the proportionality factor is called (stochastic)
information dimension and gives a global characterization of the dynamics on
the network. These general results are corroborated by examples of regular and
of fractal networks.

emitter is sufficiently resistive, and current through it sufficiently large,
then voltage loss occurs along it. This Letter provides a simple analytical and
conceptual demonstration that this voltage loss is directly and inextricably
linked to a reduction in the field enhancement factor (FEF) at the post apex. A
formula relating apex-FEF reduction to this voltage loss was obtained in the
paper by E. Minoux, O. Groening, K. B. K. Teo, S. H. Dalal, L. Gangloff, J.-P.
Schnell, L. Hudanski, I. Y. Y. Bu., P. Vincent, P. Legagneux, G. A. J.
Amaratunga, and W. I. Milne [Nano Lett. 5, 2135 (2005)], by fitting to
numerical results from a Laplace solver. This Letter derives the same formula
analytically, by using a ""floating sphere"" model. The analytical proof brings
out the underlying physics more clearly, and shows that the effect is a general
phenomenon, related to reduction in the magnitude of the surface charge in the
most protruding parts of an emitter. Voltage-dependent FEF-reduction is one
cause of ""saturation"" in Fowler-Nordheim plots. Another is a voltage-divider
effect, due to measurement-circuit resistance. An integrated theory of both
effects is presented. Both together, or either by itself, can cause saturation.
Experimentally, if saturation occurs but voltage loss is small (< 20 V, say),
then saturation is more probably due to FEF-reduction than voltage division. In
this case, existing treatments of electrostatic interaction (""shielding"")
between closely spaced emitters may need modification. Other putative causes of
saturation exist, so the present theory is a partial story. Its extension seems
possible, and could lead to a more general physical understanding of the causes
of FN-plot saturation.

Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the Nitrogen-bearing species are weak
(HCN, HNC) or not detected (CN, HNCO, N$_2$H$^+$) relative to Far-IR or CO
emission. HCO$^+$ and C$_2$H emission is normal with respect to CO and Far-IR.
While $^{13}$CO is the usual factor 10 weaker than $^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O
emission was not detected down to very low levels. Including earlier data, we
find that the HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio varies with metallicity (O/H) and attribute
this to the sharply decreasing Nitrogen abundance. The dense gas fraction,
traced by the HCN/CO and HCO$^+$/CO ratios, follows the SFR but in the low-Z
objects the HCO$^+$ is much easier to measure. Combined with larger and smaller
scale measurements, the HCO$^+$ line appears to be an excellent tracer of dense

tracking algorithms, typically used to predict shape displacements from image
features through a linear mapping. This paper presents a Functional Regression
solution to the least squares problem, which we coin Continuous Regression,
resulting in the first real-time incremental face tracker. Contrary to prior
work in Functional Regression, in which B-splines or Fourier series were used,
we propose to approximate the input space by its first-order Taylor expansion,
yielding a closed-form solution for the continuous domain of displacements. We
then extend the continuous least squares problem to correlated variables, and
demonstrate the generalisation of our approach. We incorporate Continuous
Regression into the cascaded regression framework, and show its computational
benefits for both training and testing. We then present a fast approach for
incremental learning within Cascaded Continuous Regression, coined iCCR, and
show that its complexity allows real-time face tracking, being 20 times faster
than the state of the art. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
incremental face tracker that is shown to operate in real-time. We show that
iCCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 300-VW dataset, the most
recent, large-scale benchmark for face tracking.

for a given inter- particle interaction, they define the system Hamiltonian. We
use the metric space approach to quantum mechanics to derive, from the energy
conservation law, two natural metrics for potentials. We show that these
metrics are well defined for physical potentials, regardless of whether the
system is in an eigenstate or if the potential is bounded. In addition, we
discuss the gauge freedom of potentials and how to ensure that the metrics
preserve physical relevance. Our metrics for potentials, together with the
metrics for wavefunctions and densities from [I. D'Amico, J. P. Coe, V. V.
Franca, and K. Capelle, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 050401 (2011)] paves the way for
a comprehensive study of the two fundamental theorems of Density Functional
Theory. We explore these by analysing two many- body systems for which the
related exact Kohn-Sham systems can be derived. First we consider the
information provided by each of the metrics, and we find that the density
metric performs best in distinguishing two many-body systems. Next we study for
the systems at hand the one-to-one relationships among potentials, ground state
wavefunctions, and ground state densities defined by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem
as relationships in metric spaces. We find that, in metric space, these
relationships are monotonic and incorporate regions of linearity, at least for
the systems considered. Finally, we use the metrics for wavefunctions and
potentials in order to assess quantitatively how close the many-body and
Kohn-Sham systems are: We show that, at least for the systems analysed, both
metrics provide a consistent picture, and for large regions of the parameter
space the error in approximating the many-body wavefunction with the Kohn-Sham
wavefunction lies under a threshold of 10%.

fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Although explicit versions of the IB method
can suffer from severe time step size restrictions, these methods remain
popular because of their simplicity and generality. In prior work (Guy et al.,
Adv Comput Math, 2015), some of us developed a geometric multigrid
preconditioner for a stable semi-implicit IB method under Stokes flow
conditions; however, this solver methodology used a Vanka-type smoother that
presented limited opportunities for parallelization. This work extends this
Stokes-IB solver methodology by developing smoothing techniques that are
suitable for parallel implementation. Specifically, we demonstrate that an
additive version of the Vanka smoother can yield an effective multigrid
preconditioner for the Stokes-IB equations, and we introduce an efficient Schur
complement-based smoother that is also shown to be effective for the Stokes-IB
equations. We investigate the performance of these solvers for a broad range of
material stiffnesses, both for Stokes flows and flows at nonzero Reynolds
numbers, and for thick and thin structural models. We show here that linear
solver performance degrades with increasing Reynolds number and material
stiffness, especially for thin interface cases. Nonetheless, the proposed
approaches promise to yield effective solution algorithms, especially at lower
Reynolds numbers and at modest-to-high elastic stiffnesses.

macrospicules that occurred between June 2010 and December 2015 detected at
30.4 nm wavelength. Here, we report the long-term variation of the height,
length, average speed and width of MS in Coronal Holes and Quiet Sun areas both
in the northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun. This new database helps to
refine our knowledge about the physical properties of MS. Cross-correlation of
these properties show a relatively strong correlation, but not always a
dominant one. However, a more detailed analysis indicates a wave-like signature
in the behaviour of MS properties in time. The period of these long-term
oscillatory behaviours are just under two years. Also, in terms of solar
north/south hemispheres, a strong asymmetry was found in the spatial
distribution of MS properties, which may be accounted for the solar dynamo.
This latter feature may then indicate a strong and rather intrinsic link
between global internal and local atmospheric phenomena in the Sun.

related to physics beyond the Standard Model. It is then a major concern to
constrain these approaches. Two-brane Universes involving $SO(3,1)$-broken 5D
bulks are among the cosmological models of interest. They also allow
considering matter exchange between branes, a possible way to test these
scenarios. Neutron disappearance (reappearance) toward (from) the hidden brane
is currently tested with high-precision experiments to constrain the coupling
constant $g$ between the visible and hidden neutron sectors. When dealing with
the sub-GeV-scale quantum dynamics of fermions, any pair of braneworlds can be
described by a non-commutative two-sheeted space-time $M_4\times Z_2$ from
which $g$ emerges. Nevertheless, the calculation of the formal link between $g$
for a neutron and $SO(3,1)$-broken 5D bulks remains an open problem until now
although necessary to constrain these braneworld scenarios. Thanks to a
phenomenological model, we derive $g$ - for a neutron - between the two
braneworlds endowed with their own copy of the standard model in a
$SO(3,1)$-broken 5D bulk. Constraints on interbrane distance and brane energy
scale (or brane thickness) are discussed. While brane energy scale below the
GUT scale is excluded, energy scale up to the Planck limit allows neutron
swapping detection in forthcoming experiments.

moving towards the Sun. We performed an extensive analysis of the spectral
parameters, and we applied the Hapke radiative transfer model to retrieve the
abundance and grain size of water ice, as well as the mixing modalities of
water ice and dark terrains on the three selected water ice rich areas. Study
of the spatial distribution of the spectral parameters within the ice-rich
patches has revealed that water ice follows different patterns associated to a
bimodal distribution of the grains: ~50 {\mu}m sized and ~2000 {\mu}m sized. In
all three cases, after the first detections at about 3.5 AU heliocentric
distance, the spatial extension and intensity of the water ice spectral
features increased, it reached a maximum after 60-100 days at about 3.0 AU, and
was followed by an approximately equally timed decrease and disappearanceat
about ~2.2 AU, before perihelion. The behaviour of the analysed patches can be
assimilated to a seasonal cycle. In addition we found evidence of short-term
variability associated to a diurnal water cycle. The similar lifecycle of the
three icy regions indicates that water ice is uniformly distributed in the
subsurface layers, and no large water ice reservoirs are present.

tool in exoplanet research. However, no simple way to estimate the potential
precision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines
available regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.
  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires
only basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to
estimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future
instruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.
  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit
shape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using
Monte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in
particular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.
  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to
the correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit
ingress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.
  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing
errors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to
estimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of
long-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's
validity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal
sampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in
timing-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that
transits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that
exceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition. Prompt follow-up
observations will be needed to avoid a `loosing' of their ephemeris.

structure with some net ferromagnetic (FM) moment component along the
crystallographic $\mathit{c}$ direction at intermediate Co doping levels,
finally to the pure FM order at relatively high Co doping levels. The ordering
temperature of Eu declines linearly at first, reaches the minimum value of
16.5(2) K around $\mathit{x}$ = 0.100(4), and then reverses upwards with
further Co doping. The doping-induced modification of the indirect
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the Eu$^{2+}$ moments,
which is mediated by the conduction $\mathit{d}$ electrons on the (Fe,Co)As
layers, as well as the change of the strength of the direct interaction between

addition, for Eu(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals with 0.10

function is obtained for the conformal coupling case and, although its solution
is non-analytic, within an approximation that preserves the characteristics of
the terms that break the analyticity, analytic solutions are obtained. Thus, by
means of the Bogolyubov transformations technique, the number density of
particles created is obtained, which can be compared to exact solutions already
present in literature for scalar and Dirac particles. The spectrum of created
particles is obtained and it was found that it is a generalization of the
scalar field case, which converges to the scalar field one when the specific
terms concerning the Elko field are dropped out. We also found that lighter
Elko particles are created in larger quantities than Dirac fermionic particles.
By considering the Elko particles as candidate to dark matter in the universe,
such result shows that there are more light dark matter (Elko) particles
created by gravitational effects in the universe than baryonic (fermionic)

disentangling the formation history of the Milky Way, using the fossil remnants
of disrupted star formation sites which are now dispersed around the Galaxy. It
is targeting a randomly selected, magnitude limited ($V \leq 14$) sample of
stars, with the goal of observing one million objects. To date, 300,000 spectra
have been obtained. Not all of them are correctly processed by parameter
estimation pipelines and we need to know about them. We present a
semi-automated classification scheme which identifies different types of
peculiar spectral morphologies, in an effort to discover and flag potentially
problematic spectra and thus help to preserve the integrity of the survey's
results. To this end we employ a recently developed dimensionality reduction
technique t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding), which enables
us to represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional projection
map while still preserving the properties of the local neighbourhoods of
spectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the 209,533 Galah spectra
considered in this study represents normal single stars, whereas 31,050
peculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse spectral features pertaining
to 28,579 stars are distributed into 10 classification categories: Hot stars,
Cool metal-poor giants, Molecular absorption bands, Binary stars,
H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission superimposed on
absorption, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ P-Cygni, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ inverted P-Cygni,
Lithium absorption, and Problematic. Classified spectra with supplementary
information are presented in the catalogue, indicating candidates for follow-up
observations and population studies of the short-lived phases of stellar
evolution.

between different regions, whose origin is still under debate. In this paper,
we address the question whether it is possible to unveil how the underlying
anatomical connectivity shape the brain's spontaneous correlation structure. We
start from the assumption that in order for two nodes to exhibit large
covariation, they must be exposed to similar input patterns from the entire
network. We then acknowledge that information rarely spreads only along an
unique route, but rather travels along all possible paths. In real networks the
strength of local perturbations tends to decay as they propagate away from the
sources, leading to a progressive attenuation of the original information
content and, thus, of their influence. We use these notions to derive a novel
analytical measure, $\mathcal{T}$ , which quantifies the similarity of the
whole-network input patterns arriving at any two nodes only due to the
underlying topology, in what is a generalization of the matching index. We show
that this measure of topological similarity can indeed be used to predict the
contribution of network topology to the expected correlation structure, thus
unveiling the mechanism behind the tight but elusive relationship between
structure and function in complex networks. Finally, we use this measure to
investigate brain connectivity, showing that information about the topology
defined by the complex fabric of brain axonal pathways specifies to a large
extent the time-average functional connectivity observed at rest.

kinetic theory of dilute weakly ionized gases of hydrogen-like atoms. The
approach is based on the framework of the second quantization method in the
presence of bound states of particles and the method of reduced description of
relaxation processes. Within the approach we developed the first-order
perturbation theory over the weak interaction for a system of kinetic equations
for the Wigner distribution functions of free fermions of both kinds and their
bound states, the hydrogen-like atoms. It is shown that the conditions of
low-temperature approximation, of the gas non-degeneracy and the approximation
of weak interaction are realistic and can be met in a wide range of
temperatures and the densities of the studied system. We obtain dispersion
equations for determining the frequency and wave attenuation coefficients in
dilute weakly ionized gas of hydrogen-like atoms near the described equilibrium
state. In the two-level atom approximation it is shown that in the system there
are longitudinal waves of matter polarization and transverse waves with the
behavior characteristic of plasmon polaritons. The expressions for the
dependence of the frequency and the Landau damping coefficients on the wave
vector for all branches of the oscillations detected, are obtained.
Quantitative estimations of the characteristics of the elementary perturbations
in the system on an example of a weakly ionized dilute gas of Na-23 atoms are
presented. The possibility of using the results of the theory developed to
describe the properties of a Bose condensate of photons in dilute weakly
ionized gas of hydrogen-like atoms is noted and the directions of its
generalizations are discussed.

configuration interaction approach reveal that exciton complexes containing
holes interacting with two or more electrons exhibit fairly large antibinding

In addition, an approximate self-consistent solution of the multi-exciton
problem allows us to explain two pronounced phenomena: the blue-shift of the
emission with pumping and the large inhomogenous spectral broadening, both of
those eluding explanation so far. The results are confirmed by detailed

exist indefinitely within clusters which are on circular orbits. Through a
series of N-body simulations of star cluster systems, where we vary the

derive a prediction for the scaling of the velocity dispersion at the Jacobi

tentative signal of the mass and orbital velocity dependence in kinematic data
of globular clusters from literature. We also find that the fraction of PEs
depends sensitively on the galactic mass profile, reaching as high as 40% in
the cusp of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and as the velocity anisotropy also
depends on the slope of the galactic mass profile, we conclude that PEs provide
an independent way of inferring the properties of the dark matter mass profile

contained in the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe. They are
therefore a promising complement to two-point and higher-order statistics to
constrain our cosmological models. To prepare for the high-precision data of
next-generation surveys, we assess the constraining power of peak counts in a
simulated Euclid-like survey on the cosmological parameters
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, $\sigma_8$, and $w_0^\mathrm{de}$. In particular, we study
how the Camelus model--a fast stochastic algorithm for predicting peaks--can be
applied to such large surveys. We measure the peak count abundance in a mock
shear catalogue of ~5,000 sq. deg. using a multiscale mass map filtering
technique. We then constrain the parameters of the mock survey using Camelus
combined with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We find that peak
statistics yield a tight but significantly biased constraint in the
$\sigma_8$-$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ plane, indicating the need to better understand
and control the model's systematics. We calibrate the model to remove the bias
and compare results to those from the two-point correlation functions (2PCF)
measured on the same field. In this case, we find the derived parameter
$\Sigma_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.27)^\alpha=0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ with
$\alpha=0.65$ for peaks, while for 2PCF the value is
$\Sigma_8=0.76_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ with $\alpha=0.70$. We therefore see comparable
constraining power between the two probes, and the offset of their
$\sigma_8$-$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ degeneracy directions suggests that a combined
analysis would yield tighter constraints than either measure alone. As
expected, $w_0^\mathrm{de}$ cannot be well constrained without a tomographic
analysis, but its degeneracy directions with the other two varied parameters
are still clear for both peaks and 2PCF. (abridged)

purely quantum mechanical effect and entirely defined by inherent properties of
the molecule in the junction such as its structure and symmetry. This
definition of DQI by molecular properties alone suggests its relation to other
more general concepts in chemistry as well as the possibility of deriving
simple models for its understanding and molecular device design. Recently, two
such models have gained wide spread attention, where one was a graphical scheme
based on visually inspecting the connectivity of carbon sites in conjugated pi
systems in an atomic orbital (AO) basis and the other one put the emphasis on
the amplitudes and signs of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs). There have
been discussions on the range of applicability for these schemes, but
ultimately conclusions from topological molecular Hamiltonians should not
depend on whether they are drawn from an AO or a MO representation, as long as
all the orbitals are taken into account. In this article we clarify the
relation between both models in terms of the zeroth order Green's function and
compare their predictions for a variety of systems. From this comparison we
conclude that for a correct description of DQI from a MO perspective it is
necessary to include the contributions from all MOs rather than just those from
the frontier orbitals. The cases where DQI effects can be successfully
predicted within a frontier orbital approximation we show to be limited to
alternant even-membered hydrocarbons, as a a direct consequence of the

dynamical tunneling. Three different models [classical, Random-Matrix-Theory
(RMT) based, semiclassical] to interpret the experimental data are discussed.
On the basis of least-squares analysis, theoretical estimates of Ehrenfest
time, and independent measurements, we find that a semiclassically modified
RMT-based expression best describes the experiment in all its realizations,
particularly when the resonator is coupled to visible light, while RMT alone
still works quite well in the infrared. In this work we reexamine and
substantially extend the results of a short paper published earlier [L. Wang,

allocation, and has recently gained significant interest in application areas
such as signal processing, image processing, and computer vision. Even though
it can be formulated as a linear programming problem, it is in many cases
intractable for large problems due to the vast number of variables. A recent
development to address this builds on an approximation with an entropic barrier
term and solves the resulting optimization problem using Sinkhorn iterations.
In this work we extend this methodology to a class of inverse problems. In
particular we show that Sinkhorn-type iterations can be used to compute the
proximal operator of the transport problem for large problems. A splitting
framework is then used to solve inverse problems where the optimal mass
transport cost is used for incorporating a priori information. We illustrate
the method on problems in computerized tomography. In particular we consider a
limited-angle computerized tomography problem, where a priori information is
used to compensate for missing measurements.

by Bingham-like behavior of the smectic film. The measurements above threshold

  Differential Privacy Guarantees",,,"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2663337",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differential privacy is a popular privacy model within the research community
because of the strong privacy guarantee it offers, namely that the presence or
absence of any individual in a data set does not significantly influence the
results of analyses on the data set. However, enforcing this strict guarantee
in practice significantly distorts data and/or limits data uses, thus
diminishing the analytical utility of the differentially private results. In an
attempt to address this shortcoming, several relaxations of differential
privacy have been proposed that trade off privacy guarantees for improved data
utility. In this work, we argue that the standard formalization of differential
privacy is stricter than required by the intuitive privacy guarantee it seeks.
In particular, the standard formalization requires indistinguishability of
results between any pair of neighbor data sets, while indistinguishability
between the actual data set and its neighbor data sets should be enough. This
limits the data controller's ability to adjust the level of protection to the
actual data, hence resulting in significant accuracy loss. In this respect, we
propose individual differential privacy, an alternative differential privacy
notion that offers em the same privacy guarantees as standard differential
privacy to individuals (even though not to groups of individuals). This new
notion allows the data controller to adjust the distortion to the actual data
set, which results in less distortion and more analytical accuracy. We propose
several mechanisms to attain individual differential privacy and we compare the

alternative is the use of re-sampling procedures, such as the bootstrap, but
these may be computationally intensive to an extent that renders them
impractical for modern problems. In this paper we develop a method for fast
construction of test-inversion bootstrap confidence intervals. Our approach
uses quantile regression to model the quantile of an estimator conditional on
the true value of the parameter, and we apply it on the Watterson estimator of
mutation rate in a standard coalescent model. We demonstrate an improved

order to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production,
Sauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The
main focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component
which are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via two
numerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic
method is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which
entails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of
this equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the
DHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic
fields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical
method is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore
called the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to
understand pair production in rotating Sauter pulses. The Wigner method and the
semiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each
other. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the
rotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for
experiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An
interpretation of the pair production spectra is given. Due to the general
nature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field
configurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirp or
bichromatic rotating Sauter pulses. Each of these exhibit interesting features,
including the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect in bichromatic pulses,
which could be useful in planning high-intensity laser experiments.

balance between spectrum cost and QoS depending on dynamic spectrum
availability and smart grid application requirements.
