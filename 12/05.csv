information transfer protocol of remote state preparation (RSP) is investigated
in terms of a unified nonlocality argument formulated for teleportation as well

types of local measurements used in each scenario. One of the RSP schemes uses
single particle projective measurements, while the other uses joint Bell-basis
measurements. Interestingly, the quantum mechanical violations of the Bell-CHSH
type inequalities formulated for each of the RSP setups, while being equal to
each other, also turn out to be equal to that of the corresponding Bell-CHSH

non-maximally entangled state. This reveals that for such a resource state, the
maximum amount of extractable nonlocality of correlations involved in the
transfer of information is the same for the standard teleportation protocol and
the two RSP schemes considered here, thereby implying that the essential
difference between teleportation and remote state preparation lies in the
amount of classical information required to be exchanged between parties, and

known that in contrast with the classes of all projective and flat modules, the
class of all flat Mittag-Leffler modules is not deconstructible [14], and it
does not provide for approximations when $R$ has cardinality $\leq \aleph_0$,

relative Mittag-Leffler conditions with set-theoretic homological algebra. They
make it possible to trace the facts above to their ultimate, countable, origins

applications: e.g., they yield a positive answer to Enochs' problem on module
approximations for classes of modules associated with tilting [4], and enable

of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy; (3) the support of $\Gamma$ satisfies the
""bounded width condition"", i.e., it contains weak near-unanimity operations of

  We show that if the support of $\Gamma$ violates the bounded width condition
then not only is $\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$ not solved by a constant level
of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy but it is also not solved by $\Omega(n)$
levels of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy (also known as the sum-of-squares SDP
hierarchy). For $\Gamma$ corresponding to linear equations in an Abelian group,
this result follows from existing work on inapproximability of Max-CSPs. By a
breakthrough result of Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer [STOC'15], our result
implies that for any $\Gamma$ whose support violates the bounded width
condition no SDP relaxation of polynomial-size solves
$\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$.
  We establish our result by proving that various reductions preserve exact
solvability by the Lasserre SDP hierarchy (up to a constant factor in the level
of the hierarchy). Our results hold for general-valued constraint languages,
i.e., sets of functions on a fixed finite domain that take on rational or
infinite values, and thus also hold in notable special cases of
$\{0,\infty\}$-valued languages (CSPs), $\{0,1\}$-valued languages

that this does not happen if the Galileon invariance is broken only weakly, in
a well defined sense, by a suitable coupling to gravity, providing therefore an
extension of the quantum non-renormalization properties in curved space-times.
Hence, besides discussing the phenomenological consequences and the
observational predictions for inflation, we apply such Galileon theories to the
context of the late-time acceleration of the Universe. In the last part, in
order to probe non-standard primordial scenarios, they are also employed in a
cosmology where the Big Bang singularity is smoothed down and the Universe
emerges from a Minkowski space-time, in a well defined extension at all times
of the Galilean Genesis scenario.

country a major economic player in both South America and the global community.
Consequently, exports are playing an increasingly important role in Peru's
national economy. Indeed, growing from 13.1% as of 1994, exports now contribute
approximately 21% of the GDP of Peru as of 2015. Given Peru's growing global
influence, the time is ripe for a thorough analysis of the most important
factors governing its export performance. Thus, within the framework of the
augmented gravity model of trade, this paper examines Peru's export performance
and attempts to identify the dominant economic factors that should be further
developed to increase the value of exports. The analysis was conducted from
three different aspects: (1) general economic parameters' effect on Peru's
export value, (2) more specific analysis into a major specific trade good,
copper, and (3) the impact that regional trade agreements have had on Peru's
export performance. Our panel data analysis results for each dataset revealed
interesting economic trends and were consistent with the theoretical
expectations of the gravity model: namely positive coefficients for economic
size and negative coefficients for distance. This report's results can be a
reference for the proper direction of Peruvian economic policy so as to enhance
economic growth in a sustainable direction.

result in large, and often unanticipated, changes in probability. This
instability is a property of the probability model, given by a distributional
form and a given configuration of parameters. For correlated data structures
found in several application areas, there is increasing interest in identifying
such sensitivity in model probability structure. We consider the problem of
quantifying instability for general probability models defined on sequences of
observations, where each sequence of length N has a finite number of possible
values that can be taken at each point. A sequence of probability models
results, indexed by N, and an associated parameter sequence, that accommodates
data of expanding dimension. Model instability is formally shown to occur when
a certain log-probability ratio under such models grows faster than N. In this
case, a one component change in the data sequence can shift probability by
orders of magnitude. Also, as instability becomes more extreme, the resulting
probability models are shown to tend to degeneracy, placing all their
probability on potentially small portions of the sample space. These results on
instability apply to large classes of models commonly used in random graphs,
network analysis, and machine learning contexts.

yet allows for variations in the temporal and spectral evolution of early
optical and $X$-ray afterglows. The high energy and the optical synchrotron
emission from the RS particles occurs in the fast cooling regime; the resulting
synchrotron power $L_s$ is a large fraction of the wind luminosity, $L_s
\approx L_w/\sqrt{1+\sigma_w}$ ($L_w$ and $\sigma_w$ are wind power and
magnetization). Thus, plateaus - parts of afterglow light curves that show
slowly decreasing spectral power - are a natural consequence of the RS
emission. Contribution from the forward shock (FS) is negligible in the
$X$-rays, but in the optical both FS and RS contribute similarly: the FS
optical emission is in the slow cooling regime, producing smooth components,
while the RS optical emission is in the fast cooling regime, and thus can both
produce optical plateaus and account for fast optical variability correlated
with the $X$-rays, e.g., due to changes in the wind properties. We discuss how

achieved, irrespective of its value in the initial two-atom state. Our results,
thus allow us to design a model to sustain bipartite entanglement between two

perturbation, by introducing a non-intrusive inter-cavity photon exchange that
can be physically realized through cavity-QED setups in contemporary
experiments. For completeness, we also compare the effects of inter-cavity

(RTA) is used because full solution is very challenging. Improved methods of
extrapolation to obtain the bulk thermal conductivity $\kappa$ are proposed.
Callaway invented an approximate method of correcting RTA for the $\vec{q}$
(phonon wavevector or crystal momentum) conservation of N (normal as opposed to
Umklapp) anharmonic collisions This method is generalized to the non-local case
where $\kappa(\vec{k})$ depends on wavevector of the current $\vec{j}(\vec{k})$
and temperature gradient $i\vec{k}\Delta T(\vec{k})$.

a suite of IMF types with varying slopes. We focus on the behaviour of colours,
spectra and line-strength indices in the UV range as a function of relevant

age and metallicity, as most metallicity indicators in the visible, other
indices peak around 3 Gyr for metal-rich stellar populations, such as Mg at

most line-strengths of the stellar clusters of the Milky-Way and LMC. Our

data across a subset of base stations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul
loading, secure cooperative transmission of several BSs is dynamically enabled
in accordance with the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul
capacity. Thereby, caching reduces the data sharing overhead over the
capacity-constrained backhaul links. More importantly, caching introduces
additional secure degrees of freedom and enables a power-efficient design. We
investigate the optimal caching and transmission policies for minimizing the
total transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and guaranteeing
secrecy during video delivery. A two-stage non-convex mixed-integer
optimization problem is formulated, which optimizes the caching policy in an
offline video caching stage and the cooperative transmission policy in an
online video delivery stage. As the problem is NP-hard, suboptimal
polynomial-time algorithms are proposed for low-complexity cache training and
delivery control, respectively. Sufficient optimality conditions, under which
the proposed schemes attain global optimal solutions, are also provided.
Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve low secrecy outage

control cost. The resulting control law can be used to obtain approximate
feedback laws for individual agents in a swarm control application. Using
infinitesimal generators, the optimal control problem is reduced to a modified
Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem, resulting in a convex
Benamou-Brenier type fluid dynamics formulation on a graph. The well-posedness
of this problem is shown to be a consequence of the graph being
strongly-connected, which in turn is shown to result from controllability of
the underlying dynamical system. Using our computational framework, we study
optimal transport of distributions where the underlying dynamical systems are
chaotic, and non-holonomic. The solutions to the optimal transport problem
elucidate the role played by invariant manifolds, lobe-dynamics and
almost-invariant sets in efficient transport of distributions in finite time.

all the frames in the video are processed together. This prevents timely
localization and prediction of actions and interactions - an important
consideration for many tasks including surveillance and human-machine
interaction.
  In our approach, we estimate human poses at each frame and train
discriminative appearance models using the superpixels inside the pose bounding
boxes. Since the pose estimation per frame is inherently noisy, the conditional
probability of pose hypotheses at current time-step (frame) is computed using
pose estimations in the current frame and their consistency with poses in the
previous frames. Next, both the superpixel and pose-based foreground
likelihoods are used to infer the location of actors at each time through a
Conditional Random. The issue of visual drift is handled by updating the
appearance models, and refining poses using motion smoothness on joint
locations, in an online manner. For online prediction of action (interaction)
confidences, we propose an approach based on Structural SVM that operates on
short video segments, and is trained with the objective that confidence of an
action or interaction increases as time progresses. Lastly, we quantify the
performance of both detection and prediction together, and analyze how the
prediction accuracy varies as a time function of observed action (interaction)
at different levels of detection performance. Our experiments on several
datasets suggest that despite using only a few frames to localize actions
(interactions) at each time instant, we are able to obtain competitive results
to state-of-the-art offline methods.

sensitivity analysis will be used to circumvent this difficulty, from which
viscosity data at lower temperatures (<5K) were chosen as appropriate data to
be used to retrieve the potential function between 3 and 4 angstrom. The linear
relationship between the potential energy function and the viscosity

verification. Presently, many automatic solutions to inductive invariant
generation are inflexible, only applicable to certain classes of programs, or
unpredictable. An automatic technique that circumvents these deficiencies to
some extent is candidate-based invariant generation. This paper describes our
efforts to apply candidate-based invariant generation in GPUVerify, a static
checker for programs that run on GPUs. We study a set of GPU programs that
contain loops, drawn from a number of open source suites and vendor SDKs.
  We describe the methodology we used to incrementally improve the invariant
generation capabilities of GPUVerify to handle these benchmarks, through
candidate-based invariant generation, using cheap static analysis to speculate
potential program invariants. We also describe a set of experiments that we
used to examine the effectiveness of our rules for candidate generation,
assessing rules based on their generality (the extent to which they generate
candidate invariants), hit rate (the extent to which the generated candidates
hold), worth (the extent to which provable candidates actually help in allowing
verification to succeed), and influence (the extent to which the success of one
generation rule depends on candidates generated by another rule).
  The candidates produced by GPUVerify help to verify 231 of the 253 programs.
This increase in precision, however, makes GPUVerify sluggish: the more
candidates that are generated, the more time is spent determining which are
inductive invariants. To speed up this process, we have investigated four
under-approximating program analyses that aim to reject false candidates
quickly and a framework whereby these analyses can run in sequence or in
parallel.

bound states (ABSs) that form on three-terminal carbon nanotube (CNT) QDs, with
one superconducting (S) contact in the center and two adjacent normal metal (N)
contacts. Three-terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the
N contacts as the origin of the Andreev resonance (AR) linewidths and to
determine the critical coupling strengths to S, for which a ground state
transition S-QD systems can occur. We ascribe replicas of the lowest-energy ABS
resonance to transitions between the ABS and odd-parity excited QD states, a
process called excited state ABS resonances. In the conductance between the two
N contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative
differential subgap conductance, which we explain by considering two nonlocal
processes, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from both N
terminals, and a novel mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling. In the latter,
electrons are transferred via the ABS without creating Cooper pairs in S. The
three-terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different
boundary conditions, for example by leaving S floating. Surprisingly, we find
that, depending on the boundary conditions, the experiments either show
single-particle Coulomb blockade resonances, ABS characteristics, or both in
the same measurements, seemingly contradicting the notion of ABSs replacing the
single particle states as eigenstates of the QD. We qualitatively explain these
results as originating from the finite time scale required for the coherent
oscillations between the superposition states after a single electron tunneling
event. These experiments demonstrate that three-terminal experiments on a
single complex quantum object can also be useful to investigate charge dynamics
otherwise not accessible due to the very high frequencies.

Gaussian Process (GP) techniques is studied in this paper. Using GP, the
variances computed during the modelling and inference processes allow us to
take model uncertainty into account. The main issue in using MPC to control
systems modelled by GP is the propagation of such uncertainties within the
control horizon. In this paper, two approaches to solve this problem, called
GPMPC1 and GPMPC2, are proposed. With GPMPC1, the original Stochastic Model
Predictive Control (SMPC) problem is relaxed to a deterministic nonlinear MPC
based on a basic linearized GP local model. The resulting optimization problem,
though non-convex, can be solved by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).
By incorporating the model variance into the state vector, an extended local
model is derived. This model allows us to relax the non-convex MPC problem to a
convex one which can be solved by an active-set method efficiently. The
performance of both approaches is demonstrated by applying them to two
trajectory tracking problems. Results show that both GPMPC1 and GPMPC2 produce
effective controls but GPMPC2 is much more efficient computationally.

recent advances in network information processing. However, conventional
decentralized algorithms based on projected gradient descent are incapable of
handling high dimensional constrained problems, as the projection step becomes
computationally prohibitive to compute. To address this problem, this paper
adopts a projection-free optimization approach, a.k.a.~the Frank-Wolfe (FW) or
conditional gradient algorithm. We first develop a decentralized FW (DeFW)
algorithm from the classical FW algorithm. The convergence of the proposed
algorithm is studied by viewing the decentralized algorithm as an inexact FW
algorithm. Using a diminishing step size rule and letting $t$ be the iteration
number, we show that the DeFW algorithm's convergence rate is ${\cal O}(1/t)$
for convex objectives; is ${\cal O}(1/t^2)$ for strongly convex objectives with
the optimal solution in the interior of the constraint set; and is ${\cal
O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ towards a stationary point for smooth but non-convex
objectives. We then show that a consensus-based DeFW algorithm meets the above
guarantees with two communication rounds per iteration. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed DeFW algorithm on low-complexity
robust matrix completion and communication efficient sparse learning. Numerical
results on synthetic and real data are presented to support our findings.

flat compactification. In other words, when does there exists a flat, proper
morphism $\bar\pi:\overline{W}\to\bar S$ extending $\pi$ with $\overline{W}$
regular? One interesting recent example of this occurs in the preprint
arXiv:1602.05534 of Laza, Sacca and Voisin where $\pi$ is a family of abelian
$5$-folds over a Zariski open subset $S$ of $\bar S=\mathbb{P}^5$. In that

cohomology of $R^1\pi_*\mathbb{Q}$ in degree at least $2$ provides an
obstruction to finding a $\bar\pi$. Moreover, non-vanishing in degree $1$
provides an obstruction to finding a $\bar\pi$ with irreducible fibers. Then I
observe that, in some cases of interest, results of Brylinski, Beilinson and

surrounding environment could be one of the key parameters. The SNR RCW 86
shows both thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission with different spatial
morphologies. These emission originate from the shock-heated plasma and
accelerated electrons respectively, and their intensities reflect their density
distributions. Thus, the remnant provides a suitable laboratory to test
possible association between the acceleration efficiency and the environment.
In this paper, we present results of spatially resolved spectroscopy of the
entire remnant with Suzaku. The spacially-resolved spectra are well reproduced
with a combination of a power-law for synchrotron emission and a two-component
optically thin thermal plasma, corresponding to the shocked interstellar medium
(ISM) with kT of 0.3-0.6 keV and Fe-dominated ejecta. It is discovered that the
photon index of the nonthermal component becomes smaller with decreasing the
emission measure of the shocked ISM, where the shock speed has remained high.
This result implies that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons in RCW 86
is higher in the low-density and higher shock speed regions.

creation of a Cinemagraph usually requires a static camera in a carefully
configured scene. The task becomes challenging for a regular video with a
moving camera and objects. Our approach first warps an input video into the
viewpoint of a reference camera. Based on the warped video, we propose
effective temporal analysis algorithms to detect regions with static geometry
and dynamic appearance, where geometric modeling is reliable and visually
attractive animations can be created. Lastly, the algorithm applies a sequence
of video processing techniques to produce a Cinemagraph movie. We have tested
the proposed approach on numerous challenging real scenes. To our knowledge,
this work is the first to automatically generate Cinemagraph animations from
regular movies in the wild.

chambers installed inside a neutral particle absorber 140 m away from the
Interaction Points in IR1 and IR5 and monitor the energy deposited by
electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the
collisions. The detectors have the capability to resolve the bunch-by-bunch
luminosity at the 40 MHz bunch rate, as well as to survive the extreme level of
radiation during the nominal LHC operation. The devices have operated since the
early commissioning phase of the accelerator over a broad range of luminosities
reaching 1.4*10^34 cm-2 s-1 with a peak pileup of 45 events per bunch crossing.
Even though the nominal design luminosity of the LHC has been exceeded, the
BRAN is operating well. After describing the multiple applications that the
BRAN can be used to monitor the luminosity of the accelerator, we discuss the
technical choices that led to its construction and the different tests

shortest-distance, shortest-time or highway-preferred paths. However, when the
routing decisions are made for advanced vehicles, there are other factors
affecting cost, such as vehicle powertrain type, battery state of charge (SOC)
and the change of component efficiencies under traffic conditions, which are
not considered by traditional routing systems. The impact of the trade-off
between distance and traffic on the cost of the trip might change with the type
of vehicle technology and component dynamics. As a result, the least-cost paths
might be different from the shortest-distance or shortest-time paths. In this
work, a novel routing strategy has been proposed where the decision-making
process benefits from the aforementioned information to result in a least-cost
path for drivers. We integrate vehicle powertrain dynamics into route
optimization and call this strategy as Vehicle Powertrain Connected Route
Optimization (VPCRO). We find that the optimal paths might change significantly
for all types of vehicle powertrains when VPCRO is used instead of
shortest-distance strategy. About 81% and 58% of trips were replaced by
different optimal paths with VPCRO when the vehicle type was Conventional
Vehicle (CV) and Electrified Vehicle (EV), respectively. Changed routes had
reduced travel costs on an average of 15% up to a maximum of 60% for CVs and on
an average of 6% up to a maximum of 30% for EVs. Moreover, it was observed that
3% and 10% of trips had different optimal paths for a plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle, when initial battery SOC changed from 90% to 60% and 40%,
respectively. Paper shows that using sensory information from vehicle
powertrain for route optimization plays an important role to minimize travel
costs.

accommodate renewables. Which, unlike fossil fuels, are subject to frequent
fluctuations; potentially destabilizing grid operators. With the continued
demand for solar PV system installation, there is a pressing need for utilities
to regulate the voltages at the low voltage distribution grids. We develop a
stochastic model for voltage rise as a function of injected power into the
grid. This model is formed as a linear combination of gamma random variables.
This is achieved by finding sparse bases and clustering the data into subsets
by its correlation with those bases, and fitting a gamma distribution within
each subset. We are concerned with modeling voltage rise, while taking into
account sparse events in the voltage. We use sparse singular value
decomposition (SVD) with $\ell_1$ penalty to model sparse voltage rise. More
randomness and disorder in voltage rises was observed at the point of common
coupling (PCC) of the PV systems with greater line impedance. A controller to
regulate the voltage at the PCC of a single phase solar PV system is presented.
This controller uses the stochastic model to minimize the risk of voltage rise.
Simulation results confirm that this voltage controller can lower the voltage
more effectively than conventional voltage regulators during periods of high

mathematicians want to derive the corresponding results for the first
eigenvalues of bi-Beltrami-Laplacian, they encountered great difficulties in
proving the limit theorem of the version of bi-Beltrami-Laplacian along with
the strategy due to I. Chavel and E. A. Feldman(Journal of Functional Analysis,
30 (1978), 198-222) and S. Ozawa (Duke Mathematics Journal, 48 (1981),767-778).
Therefore, as the author knows, there are no any results of Tang-Yan type(
Journal of Differential Geometry, 94 (2013) 521-540). However, by the
variational argument, we overcome the difficulties and determine the first
eigenvalues of the bi-Beltrami-Laplacian in the sense of isoparametric
hypersurfaces. We note that our proof is quite simple.

panoramic image streams, extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art
due to the lack of textures and minimal parallax. The key idea is the fusion of
single-view and multi-view reconstruction techniques via geometric relationship
detection (e.g., detecting 2D lines as coplanar in 3D). Rough geometry suffices
to perform such detection, and our approach utilizes rough surface normal
estimates from an image-to-normal deep network to discover geometric
relationships among lines. The detected relationships provide exact geometric
constraints in our line-based linear SfM formulation. A constrained linear
least squares is used to reconstruct a 3D model and camera motions, followed by
the bundle adjustment. We have validated our algorithm on challenging datasets,
outperforming various state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques.

over a complete manifold with nonempty boundary. To this end, we first point
out how the geometric analysis on a Killing graph is naturally related to a
weighted manifold structure, where the weight is defined in terms of the length
of the Killing vector field. According to this viewpoint, we introduce some
potential theory on weighted manifolds with boundary and we prove a weighted
volume estimate for intrinsic balls on the Killing graph. Finally, using these
tools, we provide the desired estimate for the weighted height in the
assumption that the Killing graph has constant weighted mean curvature and the
weighted geometry of the ambient space is suitably controlled.

structure in this coding we introduce an algebraic structure on um-spaces (a
consistent collection of semigroups). This allows us to obtain a path of
collections of subfamilies of fixed kinship h (described as ultrametric measure
spaces), for every depth h as a measurable functional of the genealogy. Random
elements in the semigroup are studied, in particular infinitely divisible
random variables. Here we define infinite divisibility of random genealogies as
the property that the h-tops can be represented as concatenation of independent
identically distributed h-forests for every h and obtain a Levy-Khintchine
representation of this object and a corresponding representation via a
concatenation of points of a Poisson point process of h-forests. Finally the
case of discrete and marked um-spaces is treated allowing to apply the results

treated based on the present work in [DG18b] and [GRG]. In the part II of this

point which separates the magnetic phase and the Fermi liquid phase depends on
the structure of the $f$ electron superlattice. The competition between the
Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction is also reflected in the magnetic
interlayer coupling between different $f$ electron layers. We demonstrate that
in the case of weak Kondo effect the magnetic interlayer coupling behaves
similar to other magnetic heterostructures without Kondo effect. However, close
to the quantum phase transition, the dependence of the interlayer coupling on
the distance between the $f$ electron layers is modified by the Kondo effect.
Another remarkable effect, which is characteristic for $f$ electron
superlattice, is that the magnetic interlayer coupling does vanish stepwise
depending on the distance between different $f$ electron layers. As a
consequence, the quantum critical point depends also stepwise on this distance.

results from numerical simulations performed on a relatively small lattice.
This approach, proposed by D. Zwanziger in \cite{Zwanziger:1993dh}, corresponds
to taking the infinite-volume limit for Landau-gauge field configurations in
two steps: firstly for the gauge transformation alone, while keeping the
lattice volume finite, and secondly for the gauge-field configuration itself.
The solutions to the gauge-fixing condition are then given in terms of Bloch
waves. Applying the method to data from Monte Carlo simulations of pure SU(2)
gauge theory in two and three space-time dimensions, we are able to evaluate
the Landau-gauge gluon propagator for lattices of linear extent up to sixteen

spherical) and (slightly) inhomogeneous cloud of self-gravitating particles.
The cloud is driven towards a virialized quasi-equilibrium state by a fast
relaxation mechanism, occurring in a typical time $\tau_c$, whose signature is
a large change in the particle energy distribution. Post-collapse particles are
divided into two main species: bound and free, the latter being ejected from
the system. Because of the initial system's anisotropy, the time varying
gravitational field breaks spherical symmetry so that the ejected mass can
carry away angular momentum and the bound system can gain a non-zero angular
momentum. In addition, while strongly bound particles form a compact core,
weakly bound ones may form, in a time scale of the order of $\tau_c$, several
satellite sub-structures. These satellites have a finite lifetime that can be
longer than $\tau_c$ and generally form a flattened distribution. Their origin
and their abundance are related to the amplitude and nature of initial density
fluctuations and to the initial cloud deviations from spherical symmetry, which
are both amplified during the collapse phase. Satellites show a time dependent
virial ratio that can be different from the equilibrium value $b\approx -1$:
although they are bound to the main virialized object, they are not necessarily
virially relaxed.

Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Networks (MPM GANs). While GANs have
recently been shown to be very effective for image generation and other tasks,
these networks have been limited to mostly single generator-discriminator
networks. We show that we can obtain multi-agent GANs that communicate through
message passing to achieve better image generation. The objectives of the
individual agents in this framework are two fold: a co-operation objective and
a competing objective. The co-operation objective ensures that the message
sharing mechanism guides the other generator to generate better than itself
while the competing objective encourages each generator to generate better than
its counterpart. We analyze and visualize the messages that these GANs share

infimum is not achieved by a finite graph, but a sequence of graphs with girth
(i. e., length of the shortest cycle) tending to infinity. In other words, the
optimization problem is solved by the infinite $d$--regular tree.

(2016) on the basis of an educated extrapolation of the latest UV/far-IR data
from HST/Herschel, and already tested against a number of independent
observables. Our SFR functions integrated down to an UV magnitude limit
M_UV<-13 (or SFR limit around 10^-2 M_sun/yr) produces a cosmic SFR density in
excellent agreement with recent determinations from IR surveys and, taking into
account a metallicity ceiling Z<Z_sun/2, with the estimates from long GRB
rates. They also yield a cosmic reionization history consistent with that
implied by the recent measurements of the Planck mission on the electron
scattering optical depth tau_es~0.058; remarkably, this result is obtained
under a conceivable assumption regarding the average value f_esc~0.1 of the
escape fraction for ionizing photons. We demonstrate via the abundance matching
technique that the above constraints concurrently imply galaxy formation to
become inefficient within dark matter halos of mass below a few 10^8 M_sun;
pleasingly, such a limit is also required not to run into the missing satellite
issue. Finally, we predict a downturn of the galaxy luminosity function
faintward of M_UV<-12, and stress that its detailed shape, as plausibly probed
in the next future by the JWST, will be extremely informative on the
astrophysics of galaxy formation in small halos, or even on the microscopic

detections accomplished during the first observing run of the two advanced LIGO

increase significantly with the full commissioning of the advanced LIGO,
advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors. The development of sophisticated data
analysis techniques to improve the opportunities of detection for low
signal-to-noise-ratio events is hence a most crucial effort. We present in this
paper one such technique, dictionary-learning algorithms, which have been
extensively developed in the last few years and successfully applied mostly in
the context of image processing. However, to the best of our knowledge, such
algorithms have not yet been employed to denoise gravitational wave signals. By
building dictionaries from numerical relativity templates of both, binary black
holes mergers and bursts of rotational core collapse, we show how
machine-learning algorithms based on dictionaries can be also successfully
applied for gravitational wave denoising. We use a subset of signals from both
catalogs, embedded in non-white Gaussian noise, to assess our techniques with a
large sample of tests and to find the best model parameters. The application of
our method to the actual signal GW150914 shows promising results.
Dictionary-learning algorithms could be a complementary addition to the
gravitational wave data analysis toolkit. They may be used to extract signals
from noise and to infer physical parameters if the data are in good enough
agreement with the morphology of the dictionary atoms.

We show that at low incident energies the kinematics of these expressions is
identical to that of commutative scattering theory. The consequences of spacial
non-commutativity are found to be more pronounced at the dynamical level where,
even at low incident energies, the phase shifts of the partial waves can
deviate strongly from commutative results. This is demonstrated for scattering
from a spherical well. The impact of non-commutativity on the well's spectrum
and on the properties of its bound and scattering states are considered in
detail. It is found that for sufficiently large well-depths the potential
effectively becomes repulsive and that the cross-section tends towards that of
hard sphere scattering. This can occur even at low incident energies when the
particle's wave-length inside the well becomes comparable to the
non-commutative length-scale.

lattice. We give a lower estimate for any $n,k$ like above. If, in the problem
posed by G. Fejes T\'oth, we replace the ball $B^n$ by a (centrally symmetric)
convex body $K\subset \bR^n$, we may ask for the infimum of all above infima of
densities of lattices of translates of $K$ with the above property, when $K$
ranges over all (centrally symmetric) convex bodies in $\bR^n$. For these
quantities we give lower estimates as well, which are sharp, or almost sharp,
for certain classes of convex bodies $K$. For $k=n-1$ we give an upper estimate
for the supremum of all above infima of densities, $K$ also ranging as above
(i.e., a ""minimax"" problem). For $n=2$ our estimate is rather close to the
conjecturable maximum. We point out the connection of the above questions to
the following problem: Find the largest radius of a cylinder, with base an
$(n-1)$-ball, that can be fitted into any lattice packing of balls (actually,
here balls can be replaced by some convex bodies $K \subset \bR^n$, the axis of

unexplored. As in the case of three coupled sites, we prove the existence of a

phenomena are observed which are not present in the case of three sites. In
particular, the asymmetric invariant sets arise in areas of the phase space
which are transient for weaker coupling and a nontrivial symmetric invariant
set emerges, shaped by an underlying centrally symmetric Lorenz map. We state
some conjectures on further invariant sets, indicating that unlike the case of

similarities and differences with respect to solar composition donor stars,
which we have extensively studied in the past. As a definite example, we
perform an application on one of the redbacks located in a globular cluster. We
performed a detailed grid of models in order to find systems that represent the
so-called redback binary radio pulsar systems with donor star masses between
0.6 and 2.0 solar masses and orbital periods in the range 0.2 - 0.9 days. We
find that the evolution of these binary systems is rather similar to those
corresponding to solar composition objects, allowing us to account for the
occurrence of redbacks in globular clusters, as the main physical ingredient is
the irradiation feedback. Redback systems are in the quasi-RLOF state, that is,
almost filling their corresponding Roche lobe. During the irradiation cycle the
system alternates between semi-detached and detached states. While detached the
system appears as a binary millisecond pulsar, called a redback. Circumstellar
material, as seen in redbacks, is left behind after the previous semi-detached
phase. The evolution of binary radio pulsar systems considering irradiation
successfully accounts for, and provides a way for, the occurrence of redback
pulsars in low-metallicity environments such as globular clusters. This is the
case despite possible effects of the low metal content of the donor star that
could drive systems away from redback configuration.

Bose polaron in one-dimensional systems with contact interactions. In this
instance of the problem of a single impurity immersed in a quantum bath, the
medium is a Lieb-Liniger gas of bosons ranging from the weakly interacting to
the Tonks-Girardeau regime, whereas the impurity is coupled to the bath via a
different contact potential producing both repulsive and attractive
interactions. Both the case of a mobile impurity, having the same mass as the
particles in the medium, and of a static impurity with infinite mass are
considered. We make use of exact numerical techniques that allow us to
calculate the ground-state energy of the impurity, its effective mass as well
as the contact parameter between the impurity and the bath. These quantities
are investigated as a function of the strength of interactions between the
impurity and the bath and within the bath. In particular, we find that the
effective mass rapidly increases to very large values when the impurity gets
strongly coupled to an otherwise weakly repulsive bath. This heavy impurity
hardly moves within the medium, thereby realizing the ""self-localization""
regime of the Landau-Pekar polaron. Furthermore, we compare our results with
predictions of perturbation theory valid for weak interactions and with exact
solutions available when the bosons in the medium behave as impenetrable
particles.

as a part of a flexible host language, rather than creating it entirely from
scratch. The semantics of an embedded DSL (EDSL) is either given directly as a
set of functions (shallow embedding), or an AST is constructed that is later
processed (deep embedding). Typically, the deep embedding is used when the EDSL
specifies domain-specific optimizations (DSO) in a form of AST transformations.
  In this paper we show that deep embedding is not necessary to specify most
optimizations. We define language semantics as action functions that are
executed during parsing. These actions build incrementally a new, arbitrary
complex program function.
  The EDSL designer is able to specify many aspects of the semantics as a
runnable code, such as variable scoping rules, custom type checking, arbitrary
control flow structures, or DSO. A sufficiently powerful staging mechanism
helps assembling the code from different actions, as well as evaluate the
semantics in arbitrarily many stages. In the end, we obtain code that is as
efficient as one written by hand.
  We never create any object representation of the code. No external traversing
algorithm is used to process the code. All program fragments are functions with
their entire semantics embedded within the function bodies. This approach
allows reusing the code between EDSL and the host language, as well as
combining actions of many different EDSLs.

value in comparison with that of the solar system meteorites. Lithium is
intensively and transiently burned in the early stages of evolution (pre-main
sequence, pMS) when the radiative core arises, and then the Li abundance only
slowly decreases during the main sequence (MS). We study the rates of lithium
burning during these two stages. In a model of the Sun, computed ignoring pMS
and without extra-convective mixing (overshooting) at the base of the
convection zone, the lithium abundance does not decrease significantly during
the MS life time of 4.6 Gyr. Analysis of helioseismic inversions together with
post-model computations of chemical composition indicates the presence of the
overshooting region and restricts its thickness. It is estimated to be
approximately half of the local pressure scale height 0.5Hp) which corresponds
to 3.8 % of the solar radius. Introducing this extra region does not noticeably
deplete lithium during the MS stage. In contrast, at the pMS stage, an
overshooting region with a value of approximately 0.18Hp is enough to produce
the observed lithium depletion. If we conclude that the dominant lithium
burning takes place during the pMS stage, the dispersion of the lithium
abundance in solar twins is explained by different physical conditions,
primarily during the early stage of evolution before the MS.

freedom, giant spin-orbit coupling and spin-valley locking. These exotic
natures stimulate efforts of exploring the potential applications in conceptual
spintronics, valleytronics and quantum computing. Among all the exotic
directions, a long lifetime of spin and/or valley polarization is critical. The
present valley dynamics studies concentrate on the band edge excitons which
predominates the optical response due to the enhanced Coulomb interaction in
two dimensions. The valley lifetime of free carriers remains in ambiguity. In
this work, we use time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy to probe the valley
dynamics of excitons and free carriers in monolayer tungsten diselinide. The
valley lifetime of free carriers is found around 2 ns at 70 K, about 3 orders
of magnitude longer than the excitons of about 2 ps. The extended valley
lifetime of free carriers evidences that exchange interaction dominates the
valley relaxation in optical excitation. The pump-probe spectroscopy also
reveals the exciton binding energy of 0.60 eV in monolayer WSe2.

most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason
for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual
information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success
comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution
washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here,
we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with
semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in
the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model
by adding boundary detection to the Segnet encoder-decoder architecture.
Second, we also include boundary detection in FCN-type models and set up a
high-end classifier ensemble. We show that boundary detection significantly
improves semantic segmentation with CNNs. Our high-end ensemble achieves > 90%

making real-time active learning feasible in re-id with human-in-the-loop.
Extensive experiments show that such a simple and fast model not only

macroscopic interface is quasistatic, and the dissipation appears only in the
region close to the contact line. When approaching the moving contact line, a
microscopic mechanism is required to regularize the singularity of viscous
dissipation. On the other hand, if the characteristic size of a fluidic system
is reduced to a range comparable to the microscopic regularization length
scale, the assumption that viscous effects are localized near the contact line
is no longer justified. In the present work, such microscopic length is the
slip length. We investigate the dewetting of a droplet using the boundary
element method. Specifically, we solve for the axisymmetric Stokes flow with i)
the Navier-slip boundary condition at the solid/liquid boundary, and ii) a
time-independent microscopic contact angle at the contact line. The profile
evolution is computed for different slip lengths and equilibrium contact
angles. When decreasing the slip length, the typical nonsphericity first
increases, reaches a maximum at a characteristic slip length $\tilde{b}_m$, and
then decreases. Regarding different equilibrium contact angles, two universal
rescalings are proposed to describe the behavior for slip lengths larger or
smaller than $\tilde{b}_m$. Around $\tilde{b}_m$, the early time evolution of
the profiles at the rim can be described by similarity solutions. The results
are explained in terms of the structure of the flow field governed by different
dissipation channels: viscous elongational flows for large slip lengths,
friction at the substrate for intermediate slip lengths, and viscous shear
flows for small slip lengths. Following the transitions between these dominant
dissipation mechanisms, our study indicates a crossover to the quasistatic
regime when the slip length is small compared to the droplet size.

for cancers. Radiation therapy employs several beams of ionizing radiation to
kill cancer tumors, but such irradiation also causes damage to normal tissues.
Therefore, a treatment plan should satisfy dose-volume constraints (DVCs).
Intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) enables to control the beam
intensities and gives more flexibility for the treatment plan to satisfy the
DVCs. Romeijn et al. (2003) replaced the DVCs in an IMRT optimization with
C-VaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) type constraints, and proposed a numerical
method based on linear programming (LP). Their approach reduced the computation
cost of the original DVCs, but the feasible region of their LP problems was
much narrow compared to the DVCs, therefore, their approach often failed to
find a feasible plan even when the DVCs were not so tight.
  In this paper, we propose a successive LP approach with the C-VaR type
constraints. We detect outliers form the solution of LP problems, and remove
them from the domain of the C-VaR type constraints. This eases the sensitivity
of C-VaR type constraints to outliers and we can search feasible plans from
wider regions. Furthermore, we can give a mathematical proof that if the
optimal value of the LP problem in the proposed approach is non-positive, the
corresponding optimal solution satisfies all the DVCs. From numerical
experiments on test data sets, we observed that our approach found feasible
solutions more appropriately than existing LP approaches. In addition, our
approach required fewer LP problems, and this led to a short computation time.

hypergraph and $ex(n,K^{(r)}_{s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r})$ be the maximum number of
edges in any $n$-vertex $K^{(r)}_{s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r}$-free $r$-uniform
hypergraph. It is well-known in the graph case that
$ex(n,K_{s,t})=\Theta(n^{2-1/s})$ when $t$ is sufficiently larger than $s$. In
this note, we generalize the above to hypergraphs by showing that if $s_r$ is
sufficiently larger than $s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{r-1}$ then $$ex(n,
K^{(r)}_{s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r})=\Theta\left(n^{r-\frac{1}{s_1s_2\cdots
s_{r-1}}}\right).$$ This follows from a more general Tur\'an type result we
establish in hypergraphs, which also improves and generalizes some recent
results of Alon and Shikhelman. The lower bounds of our results are obtained by
the powerful random algebraic method of Bukh. Another new, perhaps unsurprising
insight which we provide here is that one can also use the random algebraic
method to construct non-degenerate (hyper-)graphs for various Tur\'an type
problems.
  The asymptotics for $ex(n, K^{(r)}_{s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_r})$ is also proved by
Verstra\""ete independently with a different approach.

  Structures",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose online algorithms for sequential learning in the contextual
multi-armed bandit setting. Our approach is to partition the context space and
then optimally combine all of the possible mappings between the partition
regions and the set of bandit arms in a data driven manner. We show that in our
approach, the best mapping is able to approximate the best arm selection policy
to any desired degree under mild Lipschitz conditions. Therefore, we design our
algorithms based on the optimal adaptive combination and asymptotically achieve
the performance of the best mapping as well as the best arm selection policy.
This optimality is also guaranteed to hold even in adversarial environments
since we do not rely on any statistical assumptions regarding the contexts or
the loss of the bandit arms. Moreover, we design efficient implementations for
our algorithms in various hierarchical partitioning structures such as
lexicographical or arbitrary position splitting and binary trees (and several
other partitioning examples). For instance, in the case of binary tree
partitioning, the computational complexity is only log-linear in the number of
regions in the finest partition. In conclusion, we provide significant
performance improvements by introducing upper bounds (w.r.t. the best arm
selection policy) that are mathematically proven to vanish in the average loss
per round sense at a faster rate compared to the state-of-the-art. Our
experimental work extensively covers various scenarios ranging from bandit
settings to multi-class classification with real and synthetic data. In these

Fairall~9 is highly variable in all bands though the variability amplitude

UV/optical bands are strongly correlated. Our reverberation mapping analysis
using the {\tt JAVALIN} tool shows that the variation in the UV/optical bands
lag behind the variations in the X-ray band by $\sim 2-10{\rm~days}$. These lag
measurements strongly suggest that the optical/UV variations are mainly caused
by variations in the X-rays, and the origin of most of the optical/UV emission

$\tau\propto\lambda^{1.36\pm0.13}$, consistent with the prediction,
$\tau\propto\lambda^{4/3}$, for X-ray reprocessing in a standard accretion

estimated from the reverberation mapping of broad emission lines and accretion

bipolar conductivity depending on doping. The dispersive valence band-edges

carrier effective masses, implying chemical tunability of these properties. The
unusual combinations of relatively high band gap, low carrier masses and high

random walk on a supercritical percolation cluster (SRWPC) on $\mathbb Z^d$
($d\geq 2$). The models under interest include classical Bernoulli bond and
site percolation as well as models that exhibit long range correlations, like
the random cluster model, the random interlacement and {the vacant set of
random interlacements} (for $d\geq 3$) and the level sets of the Gaussian free
field ($d\geq 3$).
  Inspired by the methods developed by Kosygina, Rezakhanlou and Varadhan
([KRV06]) for proving quenched LDP for elliptic diffusions with a random drift,
and by Yilmaz ([Y08]) and Rosenbluth ([R06]) for similar results regarding
elliptic random walks in random environment, we take the point of view of the
moving particle and prove a large deviation principle for the quenched
distribution of the {\it{pair empirical measures}} of the environment Markov
chain in the non-elliptic case of SRWPC . Via a contraction principle, this
reduces easily to a quenched LDP for the distribution of the mean velocity of
the random walk and both rate functions admit explicit variational formulas.
  The main difficulty in our set up lies in the inherent non-ellipticity as
well as the lack of {\it{translation-invariance}} stemming from conditioning on
the fact that the origin belongs to the infinite cluster. We develop a unifying
approach for proving quenched large deviations for SRWPC based on exploiting
coercivity properties of the relative entropies in the context of convex
variational analysis, combined with input from ergodic theory and invoking
geometric properties of the supercritical percolation cluster.

investigate an isolated monomeric Myc oncoprotein that has been implicated in
carcinomas including those in colon, breast and lungs. Under physiological
conditions a monomeric Myc is presumed to be an example of intrinsically
disordered proteins, that pose a serious challenge to existing modelling
techniques. We argue that a room temperature monomeric Myc is in a dynamical
state, it oscillates between different conformations that we identify. For this
we adopt the C-alpha backbone of Myc in a crystallographic heteromer as an
initial Ansatz for the monomeric structure. We construct a multisoliton of the
pertinent Landau free energy, to describe the C-alpha profile with ultra high
precision. We use Glauber dynamics to resolve how the multisoliton responds to
repeated increases and decreases in ambient temperature. We confirm that the
initial structure is unstable in isolation. We reveal a highly degenerate
ground state landscape, an attractive set towards which Glauber dynamics
converges in the limit of vanishing ambient temperature. We analyse the thermal
stability of this Glauber attractor using room temperature molecular dynamics.
We identify and scrutinise a particularly stable subset in which the two
helical segments of the original multisoliton align in parallel, next to each
other. During the MD time evolution of a representative structure from this
subset, we observe intermittent quasiparticle oscillations along the C-terminal
alpha-helix, some of which resemble a translating Davydov's Amide-I soliton. We
propose that the presence of oscillatory motion is in line with the expected
intrinsically disordered character of Myc.

parallel robots as an outstanding instance of dynamical robotics systems. As
suggested by the name, uncertainty, is some missing information that is beyond
the knowledge of human thus we may tend to handle it properly to minimize the
side-effects through the control process.
  Type-II fuzzy logic has shown its superiority over traditional fuzzy logic
when dealing with uncertainty. Type-II fuzzy logic controllers are however
newer and more promising approaches that have been recently applied to various
fields due to their significant contribution especially when noise (as an
important instance of uncertainty) emerges. During the design of Type-I fuzzy
logic systems, we presume that we are almost certain about the fuzzy membership
functions which is not true in many cases. Thus T2FLS as a more realistic
approach dealing with practical applications might have a lot to offer. Type-II
fuzzy logic takes into account a higher level of uncertainty, in other words,
the membership grade for a type-II fuzzy variable is no longer a crisp number
but rather is itself a type-I linguistic term. In this thesis the effects of
uncertainty in dynamic control of a parallel robot is considered. More
specifically, it is intended to incorporate the Type-II Fuzzy Logic paradigm
into a model based controller, the so-called computed torque control method,

of machine learning tasks, with recent examples in cyber security and
autonomous vehicles. Despite the superior performance of DNNs in these
applications, it has been recently shown that these models are susceptible to a
particular type of attack that exploits a fundamental flaw in their design.
This attack consists of generating particular synthetic examples referred to as
adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by slightly manipulating
real data-points in order to ""fool"" the original DNN model, forcing it to
mis-classify previously correctly classified samples with high confidence.
Addressing this flaw in the model is essential if DNNs are to be used in
critical applications such as those in cyber security.
  Previous work has provided various learning algorithms to enhance the
robustness of DNN models, and they all fall into the tactic of ""security
through obscurity"". This means security can be guaranteed only if one can
obscure the learning algorithms from adversaries. Once the learning technique
is disclosed, DNNs protected by these defense mechanisms are still susceptible
to adversarial samples. In this work, we investigate this issue shared across
previous research work and propose a generic approach to escalate a DNN's
resistance to adversarial samples. More specifically, our approach integrates a
data transformation module with a DNN, making it robust even if we reveal the
underlying learning algorithm. To demonstrate the generality of our proposed
approach and its potential for handling cyber security applications, we
evaluate our method and several other existing solutions on datasets publicly

restrictions. This hampers the process of making patient-specific predictions

it is meaningful to use empirical Bayes methods in order to construct an

the base of the energy method for the resonator analysis, which is essentially
generalized and improved); 2) Geometrical symmetry of the resonator. The
results of calculations can be used in order to control the radiation
characteristics in relation to the resonator misalignments, in particular, for
analysis of the output radiation stability and sensitivity to small changes of
the cavity configuration.

adaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear
time dependent PDE for compr. dissipative flows: the compr. Navier-Stokes
equations and the equations of visc. and res. MHD in 2 and 3 space-dimensions.
The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and
application of a proper a posteriori subcell FV limiting procedure suitable for
DG methods. It is a well known fact that a major weakness of h.o. DG methods
lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate
spurious oscillations, namely the so-called 'Gibbs phenomenon'. In the present
work the main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness
even in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical
diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a
proper sub-grid. An important feature of our new scheme is its ability to cure
even floating point errors that may occur during a simulation, for example when
taking real roots of negative numbers or after divisions by zero. We apply the
whole approach for the first time to the equations of compr. gas dynamics and
MHD in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic
resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to
cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state
vector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical
scheme stands out against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the
compr. Navier-Stokes and the viscous and resistive MHD equations. The present
results show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes
are significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement
implementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).

corrections in bulk materials for higher angle broad peaks, due to the
K{\alpha} doublet, are based on the results of Pike (Acta Cryst., 12 (1959)
87-92) and Ladell (Acta Cryst. 14 (1961) 47-53). These results are extended to
thin film x-ray diffraction. The current practice in thin film studies of using
the absorption factors for monochromatic radiation in LPA corrections is
incorrect in both symmetric and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. The
correct expressions for absorption corrections are developed. In addition, a
new length scale, the linear regime, is shown to exist for very thin films
where the absorption factor and the integrated intensity are independent of the
absorption coefficient. For very thin films, it is practically advantageous to
use the expressions for the linear regime over those for the thin film regime.
The procedures to obtain both the main results are of general validity and can
be extended to several thin film diffraction techniques.

co-evaporated film irradiated by a blue laser in ultrahigh vacuum. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were
employed to investigate the irradiation effects on the surface. The core levels
of perovskite were observed to shift toward higher binding energy (BE) during
the irradiation, suggesting that surface became more n-type. Metallic Pb
appeared after 120 minutes of irradiation, indicating that the film has started
to decompose. The decomposition saturated after about 480 minutes of
irradiation when the ratio of metallic Pb to total Pb was about 33%.
Furthermore, the film was no longer continuous after irradiation because of the
stress change after irradiation, as the substrate Au and oxygen were detected
by XPS. SEM images also show a roughened surface after irradiation. The results
strongly indicate that the perovskite is sensitive to the laser irradiation,
and the decomposition is a self-limiting process.

structure of rational numbers is determined by prime factorisations. Just
Intonation frequencies can be split into two components. The larger component
uses only integer powers of the first two primes, 2 and 3. The smaller
component decomposes into a series of microtonal adjustments, one for each
prime number 5 and above present in the original frequency. The larger 3-limit
component can be notated using scientific pitch notation modified to use
Pythagorean tuning. The microtonal adjustments can be notated using rational
commas which are built up from prime commas. This gives a notation system for
the whole of free-JI, called Rational Comma Notation. RCN is compact since all
microtonal adjustments can be represented by a single notational unit based on
a rational number. RCN has different versions depending on the choice of
algorithm to assign a prime comma to each prime number. Two existing algorithms
SAG and KG2 are found in the literature. A novel algorithm DR is developed
based on discussion of mathematical and musical criteria for algorithm design.
Results for DR are presented for primes below 1400. Some observations are made
about these results and their applications, including shorthand notation and
pitch class lattices. Results for DR are compared with those for SAG and KG2.
Translation is possible between any two free-JI notations and any two versions
of RCN since they all represent the same underlying set of rational numbers.

an alternative to using traditional electricity in order to reduce operational
expenditure and carbon footprint. Due to the randomness in both RE generation
and mobile traffic at each base station (BS), a surplus or shortfall of energy
may occur at any given time. To increase energy self-reliance and minimize the
network's energy cost, the operator needs to efficiently exploit the RE
generated across all BSs. In this paper, a hybrid energy sharing framework for
cellular network is proposed, where a combination of physical power lines and
energy trading with other BSs using smart grid is used. Algorithms for physical
power lines deployment between BSs, based on average and complete statistics of
the net RE available, are developed. Afterwards, an energy management framework
is formulated to optimally determine the quantities of electricity and RE to be
procured and exchanged among BSs, respectively, while considering battery
capacities and real-time energy pricing. Three cases are investigated where RE
generation is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time.
Results investigate the time varying energy management of BSs and demonstrate
considerable reduction in average energy cost thanks to the hybrid energy
