walls may spontaneously nucleate during inflation. These objects are
subsequently stretched by the inflationary expansion, resulting in a broad
distribution of sizes. The fate of the walls after inflation depends on their
radius. Walls smaller than a critical radius fall within the cosmological
horizon early on and collapse due to their own tension, forming ordinary black
holes. But if a wall is large enough, its repulsive gravitational field becomes
dominant much before the wall can fall within the cosmological horizon. In this
""supercritical"" case, a wormhole throat develops, connecting the ambient
exterior FRW universe with an interior baby universe, where the exponential
growth of the wall radius takes place. The wormhole pinches off in a time-scale
comparable to its light-crossing time, and black holes are formed at its two
mouths. As discussed in previous work, the resulting black hole population has
a wide distribution of masses and can have significant astrophysical effects.
The mechanism of black hole formation has been previously studied for a
dust-dominated universe. Here we investigate the case of a radiation-dominated
universe, which is more relevant cosmologically, by using numerical simulations
in order to find the initial mass of a black hole as a function of the wall
size at the end of inflation. For large supercritical domain walls, this mass
nearly saturates the upper bound according to which the black hole cannot be
larger than the cosmological horizon. We also find that the subsequent
accretion of radiation satisfies a scaling relation, resulting in a mass
increase by about a factor of 2.

developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with
the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in health and

  (i) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by
comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (ii)
cluster the distance matrix for each node; (iii) build the consensus network
from the corresponding partitions; (iv) extract groups of subjects by finding
the communities of the consensus network thus obtained.
  Differently from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we
thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising
from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen
either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pre-training step to
help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a
toy model and two real data sets, show the effectiveness of the proposed
methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a
weighted network, the consensus matrix.

for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs): qualified
domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then
encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of
narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task,
since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. MagiCoder, a Natural
Language Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of
free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in
terms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of
the narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of
about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison
between human and MagiCoder revisions. For the current base version of
MagiCoder, we measured: on short descriptions, an average recall of $86\%$ and
an average precision of $88\%$; on medium-long descriptions (up to 255
characters), an average recall of $64\%$ and an average precision of $63\%$.
From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for
encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the
MagiCoder terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right
terms among the 70K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the
efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality
of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian
pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general
approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.

the action corresponding to a given state is obtained in logarithmic time with
respect to the number of samples used. Second, our method is versatile: it does
not rely on any a priori knowledge of the structure of optimal policies. We
build upon the Fitted Q-iteration algorithm which represents the $Q$-value as
the average of several regression trees. Our algorithm, the Fitted Policy
Forest algorithm (FPF), computes a regression forest representing the Q-value
and transforms it into a single tree representing the policy, while keeping
control on the size of the policy using resampling and leaf merging. We
introduce an adaptation of Multi-Resolution Exploration (MRE) which is
particularly suited to FPF. We assess the performance of FPF on three classical
benchmarks for reinforcement learning: the ""Inverted Pendulum"", the ""Double
Integrator"" and ""Car on the Hill"" and show that FPF equals or outperforms other
algorithms, although these algorithms rely on the use of particular
representations of the policies, especially chosen in order to fit each of the
three problems. Finally, we exhibit that the combination of FPF and MRE allows

recently observed by Liu and Prokopec that, among other things, an anomalous
pericenter precession would affect the orbital motion of a test particle
orbiting an isolated central body. Here, it is shown that, if it were real, its
expected magnitude for the inner planets of the Solar System would be at the
same level of the present-day accuracy in constraining any possible deviations
from their standard perihelion precessions as inferred from long data records
spanning about the last century. The most favorable situation for testing the
Verlinde-type precession seems to occur for Mars. Indeed, according to recent
versions of the EPM and INPOP planetary ephemerides, non-standard perihelion
precessions, of whatsoever physical origin, which are larger than some $\approx
0.02-0.11$ milliarcseconds per century are not admissible, while the putative
precession predicted by Liu and Prokopec amounts to $0.09$ milliarcseconds per
century. Other potentially interesting astronomical and astrophysical scenarios

findings are robust and reproducible. Using an alternative treatment of the

$(\pm1/2)$-spin electrons and $(\pm3/2)$-spin holes, as in GaAs
heterostructures, one major result is that most spin configurations lead to
brightness-conserving scatterings with equal amplitude $\Delta$, in spite of
the fact that they involve different carrier exchanges. A brightness-changing
channel also exists when two opposite-spin excitons scatter: dark excitons
$(2,-2)$ can end either in the same dark states with an amplitude $\Delta_e$,
or in opposite-spin bright states $(1,-1)$, with a different amplitude
$\Delta_o$, the number of carrier exchanges being even or odd respectively.
Another major result is that these amplitudes are linked by a striking
relation, $\Delta_e+\Delta_o=\Delta$, which has decisive consequence for
exciton Bose-Einstein condensation. Indeed, this relation leads to the
conclusion that the exciton condensate can be optically observed through a
bright part only when excitons have a large dipole, that is, when the electrons

that plays an important role in control theory, linear systems theory, and
coding theory. It is a common practice to arrange the vectors of any minimal
basis as the rows of a polynomial matrix and to call such matrix simply a
minimal basis. Very recently, minimal bases, as well as the closely related
pairs of dual minimal bases, have been applied to a number of problems that
include the solution of general inverse eigenstructure problems for polynomial
matrices, the development of new classes of linearizations and
$\ell$-ifications of polynomial matrices, and backward error analyses of
complete polynomial eigenstructure problems solved via a wide class of strong
linearizations. These new applications have revealed that although the
algebraic properties of minimal bases are rather well understood, their
robustness and the behavior of the corresponding dual minimal bases under
perturbations have not yet been explored in the literature, as far as we know.
Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail when a minimal
basis $M(\lambda)$ is robust under perturbations, i.e., when all the polynomial
matrices in a neighborhood of $M(\lambda)$ are minimal bases, and, in this
case, how perturbations of $M(\lambda)$ change its dual minimal bases. In order
to study such problems, a new characterization of whether or not a polynomial
matrix is a minimal basis in terms of a finite number of rank conditions is
introduced and, based on it, we prove that polynomial matrices are generically
minimal bases with very specific properties. In addition, some applications of
the results of this paper are discussed.

measure and compress signals that are sparse or compressible in some domain.
The choice of a sensing matrix that carries out the measurement has a defining
impact on the system performance and it is often advocated to draw its elements
randomly. It has been noted that in the presence of input (signal) noise, the
application of the sensing matrix causes SNR degradation due to the noise
folding effect. In fact, it might also result in the variations of the output
SNR in compressive measurements over the support of the input signal,
potentially resulting in unexpected non-uniform system performance. In this
work, we study the impact of a distribution from which the elements of a
sensing matrix are drawn on the spread of the output SNR. We derive analytic
expressions for several common types of sensing matrices and show that the SNR
spread grows with the decrease of the number of measurements. This makes its
negative effect especially pronounced for high compression rates that are often
of interest in CS.

AGN feedback and associated non-thermal effects, the precise mechanism that
prevents the core of some clusters of galaxies from collapsing catastrophically
by radiative cooling remains unidentified. In this paper we demonstrate that
the evolution of a cluster's cooling core, in terms of its density,
temperature, and magnetic field strength, inevitably enables the plasma
electrons there to quickly become Cerenkov loss dominated, with emission at the
radio frequency of $\lesssim$ 350 Hz, and with a rate considerably exceeding
free-free continuum and line emission. However, the same does not apply to the
plasmas at the cluster's outskirts, which lacks such radiation. Owing to its
low frequency, the radiation cannot escape, but because over the relevant scale
size of a Cerenkov wavelength the energy of an electron in the gas cannot
follow the Boltzmann distribution to the requisite precision to ensure
reabsorption always occurs slower than stimulated emission, the emitting gas
cools before it reheats. This leaves behind the radiation itself, trapped by
the overlying reflective plasma, yet providing enough pressure to maintain
quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. The mass condensation then happens by
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, at a rate determined by the outermost radius where
Cerenkov radiation can occur. In this way, it is possible to estimate the rate
at $\ap 2 M_\odot$~year$^{-1}$, consistent with observational inference. Thus
the process appears to provide a natural solution to the long standing problem
of `cooling flow' in clusters; at least it offers another line of defense
against cooling and collapse, should gas heating by AGN feedback be inadequate
in some clusters

be polarized when produced in the decay of some heavier particle, like the
gluino or the stop. The polarization is constructed, in an experiment or in
simulations, through the distribution of top decay products. Here, we propose
an estimator of top quark polarization that depends only on the kinematics of
it's mother particle, apart from its decay couplings to top quarks, and is
given in terms of the top polarization expected in the rest frame of the
decaying particle. This estimator allows one to estimate the top polarization
without performing a full simulation. We find this estimator is independent of
the production angle of the mother, top decay angle (for unpolarized mother),
and the spin of the mother particle. We study the quality of the estimator with
finite width of the mother particle via examples of gluinos and stops decaying
into top quark at LHC. We also point out how for the mass spectra of gluinos
and top squarks currently expected in a `natural' scenario, the polarization of
the top quarks produced in the gluino decays can uniquely track the mixing
angle in the stop sector.

parameters with different compositions and mass-luminosity levels as a function
of period and wavelength, and compare our results with observations. For a
fixed composition, the theoretical amplitude parameters decrease while the
phase parameters increase with wavelength, similar to the observed Fourier
parameters. The optical amplitude parameters obtained using canonical
mass-luminosity Cepheid models, exhibit a large offset with respect to the
observations for periods between 7-11 days, when compared to the non-canonical
mass-luminosity levels. The central minimum of the Hertzsprung progression for
amplitude parameters, shifts to the longer periods with decrease/increase in
metallicity/wavelength for both theoretical and observed light curves. The
principal components for Magellanic Clouds Cepheid models are consistent with
observations at optical wavelengths. We also observe two distinct populations
in the first principal component for optical and near-infrared wavelengths

the variation in the convective efficiency by increasing the adopted mixing

Langevin equation for the deflection of the bacterial body swimming in
isotropic media. We have solved this equation analytically by means of the
Green function method and shown that three parameters are sufficient to
describe the movement: the characteristic time, the steady-state solution and
the control parameter. We conclude that the tumble motion, which is manifested
as abrupt turns, is primarily caused by the rotational boost generated by the
flagellar motor and complementarily by the rotational diffusion introduced by
noise. We show that in the tumble motion the deflection is a non-stationary
stochastic process during times at which the tumbling occurs. By tuning the
control parameter our model is able to explain small turns of the bacteria
around their centres of mass along the run. We show that the deflection during
the run is an OrnsteinUhlenbeck process, which for typical run times is
stationary. We conclude that, along the run, the rotational boosts do not exist
and that only the rotational diffusion remains. Thus we have a single model to
explain the turns of through a critical value that can explain the transition
between the two turn behaviours. This model is the bacterium during the run or

Past searches for lensed quasars based on their optical and near infrared
properties have relied on photometric cuts and spectroscopic pre-selection (as
in the Sloan Quasar Lens Search), or neural networks applied to photometric
samples. These methods rely on cuts in morphology and colours, with the risk of
losing many interesting objects due to scatter in their population properties,
restrictive training sets, systematic uncertainties in catalog-based
magnitudes, and survey-to-survey photometric variations. Here, we explore the
performance of a Gaussian Mixture Model to separate point-like quasars, quasars
with an extended host, and strongly lensed quasars using griz psf and model
magnitudes and WISE W1, W2. The choice of optical magnitudes is due to their
presence in all current and upcoming releases of wide-field surveys, whereas UV
information is not always available. We then assess the contamination from blue
galaxies and the role of additional features such as W3 magnitudes or psf-model
terms as morphological information. As a demonstration, we conduct a search in

leptonic partner very light. This state is thus identified with the electron.
We then provide a generic dynamical implementation of this mechanism, using
tree-level exchanges of vector leptons to relate the quark and lepton flavor
structures. In a supersymmetric context, this same mechanism splits the squark
masses, and third generation squarks end up much lighter than the others.

introducing any flavor structure beyond the two minimal Yukawa couplings,
ensuring the absence of unknown mixing matrices and their potentially large

perspectives for the direct determination of geopotential differences between
any two points at a centimeter-level accuracy in geoid height. However, so far
detailed quantitative estimates of the possible improvement in geoid
determination when adding such clock measurements to existing data are lacking.
We present a first step in that direction with the aim and hope of triggering
further work and efforts in this emerging field of chronometric geodesy and
geophysics. We specifically focus on evaluating the contribution of this new
kind of direct measurements in determining the geopotential at high spatial
resolution (~ 10 km). We studied two test areas, both located in France and
corresponding to a middle (Massif Central) and high (Alps) mountainous terrain.
These regions are interesting because the gravitational field strength varies
greatly from place to place at high spatial resolution due to the complex
topography. Our method consists in first generating a synthetic high resolution
geopotential map, then drawing synthetic measurement data (gravimetry and clock
data) from it, and finally reconstructing the geopotential map from that data
using least squares collocation. The quality of the reconstructed map is then
assessed by comparing it to the original one used to generate the data. We show
that adding only a few clock data points (less than 1 % of the gravimetry data)
reduces the bias significantly and improves the standard deviation by a factor
3. The effect of the data coverage and data quality on the results is
investigated, and the trade-off between the measurement noise level and the

dynamics of group formation. The latter constitutes a relevant phenomenon
observed in different animal species, whose individuals tend to cluster
together forming groups of different size. Results of previous investigations
suggest that this phenomenon might have similar reasons across different
species, such as improving the individual safety (e.g. from predators), and
increasing the probability to get food resources. Remarkably, the group size
might strongly vary from species to species, and sometimes even within the same
species. In the proposed model, an agent population tries to form homogeneous
groups. The homogeneity of a group is computed according to a spin vector, that
characterizes each agent, and represents a set a features (e.g. physical
traits). We analyze the formation of groups of different size, on varying a
parameter named 'individual payoff'. The latter represents the gain one agent
would receive acting individually. In particular, the agents choose whether to
form a group (receiving a 'group payoff'), or if to play individually
(receiving an 'individual payoff'). The phase diagram representing the
equilibria of our population shows a sharp transition between the 'group phase'
and the 'individual phase', in correspondence of a critical 'individual
payoff'. In addition, we found that forming (homogeneous) small groups is
easier than forming big groups. To conclude, we deem that our model and the
related results supports the hypothesis that the phenomenon of group formation
has evolutionary roots.

disordered glass optical fiber is reported. Previous demonstrations of random
lasers have found limited applications because of their multi-directionality
and chaotic fluctuations in the laser emission. The random laser presented in
this paper operates in the Anderson localization regime. The disorder induced
localized states form isolated local channels that make the output laser beam
highly directional and stabilize its spectrum. The strong transverse disorder
and longitudinal invariance result in isolated lasing modes with negligible
interaction with their surroundings, traveling back and forth in a Fabry-Perot
cavity formed by the air-fiber interfaces. It is shown that if a localized
input pump is scanned across the disordered fiber input facet, the output laser
signal follows the transverse position of the pump. Moreover, a uniformly
distributed pump across the input facet of the disordered fiber generates a
laser signal with very low spatial coherence that can be of practical
importance in many optical platforms including image transport with fiber
bundles.

research, both in theoretical and experimental domains. In this work we
consider time-periodically modulated quantum systems which are in contact with
a stationary environment. Within the framework of a quantum master equation,
the asymptotic states of such systems are described by time-periodic density
operators. Resolution of these operators constitutes a non-trivial
computational task. To go beyond the current size limits, we use the quantum
trajectory method which unravels master equation for the density operator into
a set of stochastic processes for wave functions. The asymptotic density matrix
is calculated by performing a statistical sampling over the ensemble of quantum
trajectories, preceded by a long transient propagation. We follow the ideology
of event-driven programming and construct a new algorithmic realization of the
method. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing for long 'leaps'
forward in time, and is numerically exact in the sense that, being given the
list of uniformly distributed (on the unit interval) random numbers, $\{\eta_1,
\eta_2,...,\eta_n\}$, one could propagate a quantum trajectory (with $\eta_i$'s
as norm thresholds) in a numerically exact way. %Since the quantum trajectory
method falls into the class of standard sampling problems, performance of the
algorithm %can be substantially improved by implementing it on a computer
cluster. By using a scalable $N$-particle quantum model, we demonstrate that
the algorithm allows us to resolve the asymptotic density operator of the model
system with $N = 2000$ states on a regular-size computer cluster, thus reaching
the scale on which numerical studies of modulated Hamiltonian systems are

are able to best explain the observed state. In this paper, we tackle the
effector detection problem from two perspectives. The first approach is based
on the influence distance that measures the chance that an active user can
activate its neighbors. For a certain pair of users, the shorter the influence
distance, the higher probability that one can activate the other. Given an
activation state, the effectors are expected to have short influence distance
to active users while long to inactive users. By this idea, we propose the
influence-distance-based effector detection problem and provide a
3-approximation. Second, we address the effector detection problem by the
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. We prove that the optimal MLE can
be obtained in polynomial time for connected directed acyclic graphs. For
general graphs, we first extract a directed acyclic subgraph that can well
preserve the information in the original graph and then apply the MLE approach
to the extracted subgraph to obtain the effectors. The effectiveness of our

confidence level interval $-6.6\times 10^{-13}$ s/s $< \dot{P}_{orb} < 6.5

investigated the pulse profile dependence on energy finding a peculiar
behaviour of the pulse fractional amplitude and lags as a function of energy.
We performed a phase-resolved spectroscopy showing that the blackbody component
tracks remarkably well the pulse-profile, indicating that this component
resides at the neutron star surface (hot-spot).

process where thermalization occurs will be at second order in the perturbation
that moves us away from the orbifold point. The operator governing the
deformation off of the orbifold point consists of a twist operator combined
with a supercharge operator acting on this twist. In a previous paper we
computed the action of two twist operators on an arbitrary state of the CFT. In
the present work we compute the action of the supercharges on these twist
operators, thereby obtaining the full action of two deformation operators on an

the amplitude with just the twists through an action of the supercharge

computation consists of moving the contours from the twist operators to the
initial and final states; to do this one must first map the amplitude to a
covering space where the twists are removed, and then map back to the original

in which the AE values should not drop below 200 nT. Once the events are
selected, we perform a statistical analysis of the interplanetary parameters
during their occurrences. The distribution of HILDCAA* events along the solar
cycle shows a pattern of double peak, with a peak around the maximum of the
sunspot cycle, and an other in the descending phase. This kind of distribution
is similar to the distribution of low-latitude coronal holes. For each of the
HILDCAA* events, we have found its related Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF)

AdS are largely unexplored, mostly due to technical difficulties in direct
calculations. We revisit this problem, and the dual $1/N$ expansion of CFTs, in
two independent ways. The first is to show how to explicitly solve the crossing
equations to the first subleading order in $1/N^2$, given a leading order
solution. This is done as a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the spin,
to all orders. These expansions can be resummed, leading to the CFT data for
finite values of the spin. Our second approach involves Mellin space. We show
how the polar part of the four-point, loop-level Mellin amplitudes can be fully
reconstructed from the leading-order data. The anomalous dimensions computed
with both methods agree. In the case of $\phi^4$ theory in AdS, our crossing
solution reproduces a previous computation of the one-loop bubble diagram. We
can go further, deriving part of the four-point function in $\phi^3+\phi^4$
theory in AdS which had never been computed. In the process, we show how to
analytically derive anomalous dimensions from Mellin amplitudes with an
infinite series of poles, and discuss applications to more complicated cases

in the limit of Planckian curvature scales, spacetime may undergo a transition
from the Lorentzian to Euclidean signature. This effect is a consequence of
quantum modifications of the hypersurface deformation algebra, which in the
linearized case is equivalent to a deformed version of the Poincar\'e algebra.
In this paper the latter relation is applied to the LQG-inspired hypersurface
deformation algebra that is characterized by the above mentioned signature
change.
  While the exact form of the deformed Poincar\'e algebra is not uniquely
determined, the algebra under consideration is representative enough to capture
a number of qualitative features. In particular, the analysis reveals that the
signature change can be associated with two symmetric invariant energy scales,
which separate three physically disconnected momentum subspaces.
  Furthermore, the invariant measure on momentum space is derived, which allows
to properly define the average return probability, characterizing a fictitious
diffusion process on spacetime. The diffusion is subsequently studied in the
momentum representation for all possible variants of the model. Finally, the
spectral dimension of spacetime is calculated in each case as a function of the
scale parameter. In the most interesting case the deformation is of the
asymptotically ultralocal type and the spectral dimension undergoes a reduction
to $d_S = 1$ in the UV limit.

waves in locally periodic media. A key issue is that the Bloch-dispersion
curves vary with the local microstructure, giving rise to hidden singularities
associated with band-gap edges and branch crossings. We describe an asymptotic
approach for overcoming this difficulty, and take a first step by studying in
detail the simplest case of 1D Helmholtz waves. The method entails matching
adiabatically propagating Bloch waves, captured by a multiple-scale
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, with complementary
multiple-scale solutions spatially localised about dispersion singularities.
Within the latter regions the Bloch wavenumber is nearly critical; this allows
their homogenisation, following the method of high-frequency homogenisation
(HFH), over a naturally arising scale intermediate between the periodicity
(wavelength) and the macro-scale. Analogously to a classical turning-point
analysis, we show that close to a spatial band-gap edge the solution is an Airy
function, only that it is modulated on the short scale by a standing-wave Bloch
eigenfunction. By carrying out the asymptotic matching between the WKB and HFH
solutions we provide a detailed description of Bloch-wave reflection from a
band gap. Finally, we implement the asymptotic theory for a layered medium and
demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical computations.

model. We use controlled N-body simulations of galaxies to study the
gravitational effect of baryons in a scenario with collisionless cold dark
matter (CDM) versus one with a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) component.
In particular, we examine the inner profiles of the rotation curves in the
velocity range Vmax = 30-250 km/s, whose diversity has been found to be greater
than predicted by the Lambda-CDM scenario. We find that the scatter in the
observed rotation curves exceeds that predicted by dark matter only
mass-concentration relations in either the CDM nor SIDM models. Allowing for
realistic baryonic content and spatial distributions, however, helps create a
large variety of rotation curve shapes; which is in better agreement with
observations in the case of self-interactions due to the characteristic cored
profiles being more accommodating to the slowly rising rotation curves than
CDM. We find individual fits to model two of the most remarkable outliers of
similar Vmax, UGC 5721 and IC 2574, the former a cusp-like rotation curve and
the latter a seemingly 8 kpc cored profile. This diversity in SIDM arises as
permutations of overly concentrated halos with compact baryonic distributions
versus underdense halos with extended baryonic disks. The SIDM solution is
promising and its feasibility ultimately depends on the sampling of the halo
mass-concentration relation and its interplay with the baryonic profiles,
emphasising the need for a better understanding of the frequency of extreme
outliers present in current observational samples.

as long as the isotropic cross-section is appropriately matched to the

using the momentum transfer cross-section, as has been done previously.
Matching should instead be performed via a modified momentum transfer
cross-section that takes into account that dark matter particles can be
relabelled after they scatter, without altering the dynamics. However, using
cross-sections that are matched to give the same behaviour in isolated haloes,
we find that treating dark matter scattering as isotropic under-predicts the
effects of anisotropic dark matter scattering when haloes collide. In
particular, the DM-galaxy offset induced by SIDM in colliding galaxy clusters
is larger when we simulate the underlying particle model, than if we use a
matched isotropic model. On the other hand, well motivated particle models with
anisotropic scattering typically have cross-sections with a strong velocity
dependence, and we discover a previously unrecognised effect that suppresses
DM-galaxy offsets in colliding clusters making it hard for these systems to
provide competitive constraints on such particle models.

photometry of the young star RIK-210 in the Upper Scorpius OB association.
These dimming events are variable in depth, duration, and morphology. High
spatial resolution imaging revealed the star is single, and radial velocity
monitoring indicated that the dimming events can not be due to an eclipsing
stellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the
dimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming
events suggests they are not due to a single, spherical body. The ingress of
each dimming event is always shallower than egress, as one would expect for an
orbiting body with a leading tail. The dimming events are periodic and
synchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely the
dimming events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on
the observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a protoplanetary
disk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks
the infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the
possibilities that the dimming events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a
transiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric
orbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of
dust or debris near the corotation radius.

stochastic, Pauli channel error model for describing the noise on physical

rotations) on physical data qubits result in both physical and logical error
rates that differ significantly from those predicted by a Pauli model. Here we
examine the accuracy of the Pauli approximation for coherent errors on data
qubits under the repetition code. We analytically evaluate the logical error as
a function of concatenation level and code distance. We find that coherent
errors result in logical errors that are partially coherent and therefore
non-Pauli. However, the coherent part of the error is negligible after two or
more concatenation levels or at fewer than $\epsilon^{-(d-1)}$ error correction
cycles, where $\epsilon \ll 1$ is the rotation angle error per cycle for a
single physical qubit and $d$ is the code distance. These results lend support
to the validity of modeling coherent errors using a Pauli channel under some
minimum requirements for code distance and/or concatenation.

a relativistic wind injected from the central region is studied in analytic and
numerical ways. As a result of the collision between the ejecta and the wind, a
geometrically thin shell surrounding a hot bubble forms and expands in the
ejecta. We use a self-similar solution to describe the early dynamical
evolution of the shell and carry out a two-dimensional special relativistic
hydrodynamic simulation to follow further evolution. The Rayleigh-Taylor
instability inevitably develops at the contact surface separating the shocked
wind and ejecta, leading to the complete destruction of the shell and the
leakage of hot gas from the hot bubble. The leaking hot materials immediately
catch up with the outermost layer of the supernova ejecta and thus different
layers of the ejecta are mixed. We present the spatial profiles of
hydrodynamical variables and the kinetic energy distributions of the ejecta. We
stop the energy injection when a total energy of $10^{52}$ erg, which is 10
times larger than the initial kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta, is
deposited into the ejecta and follow the subsequent evolution. From the results
of our simulations, we consider expected emission from supernova ejecta powered
by the energy injection at the centre and discuss the possibility that
superluminous supernovae and broad-lined Ic supernovae could be produced by

to be largely controlled by the amount of poloidal magnetic flux threading the
disk, which is further controlled by the poorly understood process of magnetic
flux transport. In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely
frozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk
is largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and
ions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can
play a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional
simulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with
prescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is
aligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward
at the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the
midplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a
global manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration
further promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to
instability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported
outward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is
comparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall
effect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely
vertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the
upper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.
Overall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the
aligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing
disk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk
microphysics which remains to be explored in future studies.

one is free to choose a convenient renormalization scheme, and the holographic
renormalization method is only one such choice. We show how the bulk theory can
be rendered finite with a renormalization scheme that corresponds to
dimensional renormalization in the dual CFT. The method does not require any

one-to-one map between bulk and boundary counterterms and leads to an exact and

brightnesses of the gas around high specific star formation rate galaxies are

the cosmic ray positron flux. It confirms that pure secondary predictions fall
below the data above 10 GeV, suggesting the presence of a primary component,
e.g. annihilations of WIMPs dark matter. Most analyses have focused on the
high-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where
cosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.
Given the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the
positron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport
processes so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We
devise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so
far neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of
inverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It
allows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,
which we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not
overshoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients
survive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of
cosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio. We then
scan over WIMP mass to fit the annihilation cross section and branching ratios,
exploring both direct annihilations into standard model particles or through
light mediators. In the former case, the best fit yields a $p$-value of 0.4%
for a mass of 264 GeV, a value that does not allow to reproduce the highest
energy data points. Worse quality fits are found in the latter case. The
interpretation of the positron excess in terms of single DM species
annihilations is strongly disfavored. This conclusion is based solely on the
positron data, and no other observation needs to be invoked.

architectures. We further model both local and global context by embedding
intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages
consistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds
fine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. Our model is
efficiently trained end-to-end on a graphics processing unit (GPU), in a single
stage, exploiting the dense inference capabilities of fully CNNs.
  We performed comprehensive experiments over two publicly available datasets.
First, we demonstrate a state-of-the-art performance on the ISBR dataset. Then,
we report a {\em large-scale} multi-site evaluation over 1112 unregistered
subject datasets acquired from 17 different sites (ABIDE dataset), with ages
ranging from 7 to 64 years, showing that our method is robust to various

segmentations that are highly consistent with a standard atlas-based approach,
while running in a fraction of the time needed by atlas-based methods and
avoiding registration/normalization steps. This makes it convenient for massive

work is the first to study subcortical structure segmentation on such
large-scale and heterogeneous data.

polyatomic species, could be treated with the same methods in the same
apparatus by changing the molecular source. Combined with long interrogation
times afforded by ion traps, a broad range of molecular ions could be studied

proposed applications, such as precision molecular spectroscopy, stringent
tests of fundamental physics, quantum computing, and precision control of

represented by a hierarchy or tree where the branch structure, rather than just
the proximity, is important. The representation is related to p-adic number

The application of an external field leads to a slighlt increase of the
saturation level for large wavelengths, while it does not affect the small
wavelengths. Multi-mode and temperature effects are then investigated. While at
large temperature the saturation level is independent of the external magnetic

The SMCNOD is indistinguishable in age, metallicity and distance from the
nearby SMC stars, being primarly composed of intermediate-age stars (6 Gyr,
Z=0.001), with a small fraction of young stars (1 Gyr, Z=0.01). The SMCNOD has
an elongated shape with an ellipticity of 0.6 and a size of $\sim$ 6x2 deg. It

removed from the SMC disk by tidal stripping, since it is located near the head
of the Magellanic Stream, and the literature indicates likely recent LMC-SMC
encounters. This scenario is supported by the lack of significant HI gas. Other
potential scenarios for the SMCNOD origin are a transient over-density within
the SMC tidal radius or a primordial SMC satellite in advanced stage of

discovered in MOA-II microlensing survey alert system events from 2007 to 2012.
We determine the survey sensitivity as a function of planet-star mass ratio,
$q$, and projected planet-star separation, $s$, in Einstein radius units. We
find that the mass ratio function is not a single power-law, but has a change
in slope at $q \sim 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $\sim 20 M_{\oplus}$ for the
median host star mass of $\sim 0.6 M_{\odot}$. We find significant planetary
signals in 23 of the 1474 alert events that are well characterized by the
MOA-II survey data alone. Data from other groups are used only to characterize
planetary signals that have been identified in the MOA data alone. The
distribution of mass ratios and separations of the planets found in our sample
are well fit by a broken power-law model of the form $dN_{\rm pl}/(d{\rm log}
q\ d{\rm log} s) = A (q/q_{\rm br})^n s^m \, {\rm dex}^{-2}$ for $q > q_{\rm
br}$ and $dN_{\rm pl}/(d{\rm log} q\ d{\rm log} s) = A (q/q_{\rm br})^p s^m \,
{\rm dex}^{-2}$ for $q < q_{\rm br}$, where $q_{\rm br}$ is the mass ratio of
the break. We also combine this analysis with the previous analyses of Gould et
al. and Cassan et al., bringing the total sample to 30 planets. This combined
analysis yields $A = 0.61^{+0.21}_{-0.16}$, $n =-0.93\pm 0.13$, $m =
0.49_{-0.49}^{+0.47}$ and $p = 0.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ for $q_{\rm br}\equiv
1.7\times 10^{-4}$. The unbroken power law model is disfavored with a $p$-value
of 0.0022, which corresponds to a Bayes factor of 27 favoring the broken
power-law model. These results imply that cold Neptunes are likely to be the
most common type of planets beyond the snow line.

solutions has been stressed in recent years. While a large number of dedicated
hardware using different precisions has recently been proposed, there exists no
comprehensive study of different bit precisions and arithmetic in both inputs
and network parameters. In this work, we address this issue and perform a study
of different bit-precisions in neural networks (from floating-point to
fixed-point, powers of two, and binary). In our evaluation, we consider and
analyze the effect of precision scaling on both network accuracy and hardware
metrics including memory footprint, power and energy consumption, and design
area. We also investigate training-time methodologies to compensate for the
reduction in accuracy due to limited bit precision and demonstrate that in most
cases, precision scaling can deliver significant benefits in design metrics at
the cost of very modest decreases in network accuracy. In addition, we propose
that a small portion of the benefits achieved when using lower precisions can
be forfeited to increase the network size and therefore the accuracy. We

agreement with previous studies of the Swift/BAT AGN. We provide a scaling to
convert X-ray luminosities into 8 - 1000 $\mu$m AGN luminosities, as well as
determine the best mid-to-far IR colors for identifying AGN dominated galaxies

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the corresponding time-dependent

the kink instability in the blazar emission region based on relativistic MHD

flares with polarization angle (PA) swings or weak flares with polarization
fluctuations, depending on the initial magnetic topology and magnetization.
These findings are consistent with observations. Compared with the shock model,
the kink model generates polarization signatures that are in better agreement

eliminates systematic uncertainties arising from the use of external beta
sources, as in experiments with spectrometers. This measurement was proposed in
1982 by A. De Rujula and M. Lusignoli, but only recently the detector

direct neutrino mass measurement with a calorimetric approach, will also
establish the potential of this approach to extend the sensitivity down to 0.1
eV and lower. In its final configuration HOLMES will collect about $3\cdot
10^{13}$ decays with 1000 detectors characterized by an instrumental energy
resolution of the order of few eV and a time resolution of few microseconds. To
embed the $^{163}$Ho into the gold absorbers a custom mass separator ion
implanter is being developed. The detectors used for the HOLMES experiment will
be Mo/Cu bilayers TESs (Transition Edge Sensors) on SiN$_x$ membrane with gold
absorbers. Microwave multiplexed rf-SQUIDs are the best available technique to
read out large array of such detectors. An extensive R&D activity is in

performances of the individual detectors. The current activities are focused on
the the single detector performances optimization and on the $^{163}$Ho isotope

impacted the stellar evolution; carbon, magnesium, and neon are potentially
important elements to individually consider due to their relatively high (but

tool for reconstruction of hidden features in recorded mixtures of signals. In
the case of a linear approximation, the mixtures can be decomposed by a variety
of model-free Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms. Most of the available
BSS algorithms consider an instantaneous mixing of signals, while the case when
the mixtures are linear combinations of signals with delays is less explored.
Especially difficult is the case when the number of sources of the signals with
delays is unknown and has to be determined from the data as well. To address
this problem, in this paper, we present a new method based on Nonnegative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) that is capable of identifying: (a) the unknown

and (c) the locations of the sources. Our method can be used to decompose
records of mixtures of signals with delays emitted by an unknown number of
sources in a nondispersive medium, based only on recorded data. This is the
case, for example, when electromagnetic signals from multiple antennas are
received asynchronously; or mixtures of acoustic or seismic signals recorded by
sensors located at different positions; or when a shift in frequency is induced
by the Doppler effect. By applying our method to synthetic datasets, we
demonstrate its ability to identify the unknown number of sources as well as
the waveforms, the delays, and the strengths of the signals. Using Bayesian
analysis, we also evaluate estimation uncertainties and identify the region of
likelihood where the positions of the sources can be found.

proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and
demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family
of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but
without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this
context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured
variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than
previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating
variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting
approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope
of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with

perceived impact do not align well, unless one properly accounts for strong
psychological biases that affect the opinions of experts with respect to their
own papers vs. those of others. First, researchers tend to largely prefer their
own publications to the most cited papers in their field of research. Second,
there is only a mild positive correlation between the number of citations of
top-cited papers in given research areas and expert preference in pairwise

when researchers were asked to choose among pairs of their own papers, thus
eliminating the bias favouring one's own papers over those of others, they did
systematically prefer the most cited article. We conclude that, when scientists

a fast transverse instability. It develops within a hundred turns and, in
certain conditions, may lead to a beam loss. The high rate of the instability
suggest that its cause is electron cloud. We studied the phenomena by observing
the dynamics of stable and unstable beam, simulating numerically the build-up
of the electron cloud, and developed an analytical model of an electron cloud
driven instability with the electrons trapped in combined function di-poles. We
found that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearing bunch, which confirms
the electron cloud nature of the instability. The clearing suggest electron
cloud trapping in Recycler combined function mag-nets. Numerical simulations
show that up to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since
the process of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount
of electrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next
revolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multi-turn accumulation
allows the electron cloud reaching final intensities orders of magnitude
greater than in a pure dipole. The estimated resulting instability growth rate
of about 30 revolutions and the mode fre-quency of 0.4 MHz are consistent with
experimental observations and agree with the simulation in the PEI code. The
created instability model allows investigating the beam stability for the
future intensity upgrades.

continuous, degree-one, and piecewise-linear, with two different slopes. They

utilizes a combination of low-cost sensor technologies to facilitate accurate
measurements and approximations of the size, velocity, and angle of impacting
micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). Two thin layers of kapton sheets
with resistive traces are used to detect the changes in resistance that are
directly proportional to the impacting force caused by the fast traveling
particles. Four polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensors are positioned in the
back of each kapton sheet to measure acoustic strain caused by an impact. The
electronic hardware module that controls all operations employs a low-power,
modular, and compact design that enables it to be installed as a low-resource
load on a host satellite. Laboratory results demonstrate that in addition to
having the ability to detect an impact event, the DRAGONS system can determine
impact location, speed, and angle of impact with a mean error of 1.4 cm, 0.2

The main reason is that variations of (chemical) pressure or doping strongly
influence the Kondo coupling $J_{\text{K}}$ and the chemical potential $\mu$ --
both essential parameters determining the ground state of the material -- and
thus possible $\lambda_{\rm{SOC}}$ tuning effects have remained unnoticed. Here
we present the successful growth of the substitution series
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_3$ ($0 \le x \le 1$) of the archetypal

is isostructural, isoelectronic, and isosize, and therefore likely to leave
$J_{\text{K}}$ and $\mu$ essentially unchanged. By contrast, the large mass
difference between the $5d$ element Pt and the $4d$ element Pd leads to a large
difference in $\lambda_{\rm{SOC}}$, which thus is the dominating tuning
parameter in the series. Surprisingly, with increasing $x$ (decreasing
$\lambda_{\rm{SOC}}$), we observe a Kondo insulator to semimetal transition,
demonstrating an unprecedented drastic influence of the SOC. The fully
substituted end compound Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ shows thermodynamic signatures of a

that they do not adapt well to changes in unexpected situations. This paper
addresses the situation in which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable

objective function that must be evaluated and learned through simulations. Once
this objective function has been modeled, the agent can then choose its desired
behavior in different situations. Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process
surrogate is used as the method for investigating the objective function. One
key benefit is that during optimization the Gaussian Process learns a global
estimate of the true objective function, with predicted outcomes and a
statistical measure of confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet.
However, standard Bayesian optimization does not perform consistently or
provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate function for highly volatile
objective functions. We treat these problems by introducing a novel sampling
technique called Hybrid Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This technique gives the
AI ability to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain environment. More
importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the optimization, but also
creates a better model of the entire objective surface. With this improved

there is no need for centralized QA and cross-layer interactions are minimized.

skewness and kurtosis of the polarization gradient and the Mach number of the
turbulence, or assumed this correlation to deduce the Mach number of an
observed turbulent region. We present polarization gradient images of the
entire CGPS dataset, and analyze the dependence of these images on angular
resolution. The polarization gradients are filamentary, and the length of these
filaments is largest towards the Galactic anti-center, and smallest towards the
inner Galaxy. This may imply that small-scale turbulence is stronger in the
inner Galaxy, or that we observe more distant features at low Galactic
longitudes. For every resolution studied, the skewness of the polarization
gradient is influenced by the edges of bright polarization gradient regions,
which are not related to the turbulence revealed by the polarization gradients.
We also find that the skewness of the polarization gradient is sensitive to the
size of the box used to calculate the skewness, but insensitive to Galactic
longitude, implying that the skewness only probes the number and magnitude of
the inhomogeneities within the box. We conclude that the skewness and kurtosis

However, the number of antennas that can be equipped at a base station (BS) is
limited by the BS form factor, posing a challenge to the deployment of massive
linear arrays. To cope with this limitation, this work discusses Full Dimension
MIMO (FD-MIMO), which is currently an active area of research and
standardization in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for evolution
towards fifth generation (5G) cellular systems. FD-MIMO utilizes an active
antenna system (AAS) with a 2D planar array structure, which provides the
ability of adaptive electronic beamforming in the 3D space. This paper presents
the design of the AAS and the ongoing efforts in the 3GPP to develop the
corresponding 3D channel model. Compact structure of large-scale antenna arrays
drastically increases the spatial correlation in FD-MIMO systems. In order to
account for its effects, the generalized spatial correlation functions for
channels constituted by individual antenna elements and overall antenna ports
in the AAS are derived. Exploiting the quasi-static channel covariance matrices
of the users, the problem of determining the optimal downtilt weight vector for
antenna ports, which maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference ratio of a
multi-user multiple-input-single-output system, is formulated as a fractional
optimization problem. A quasi-optimal solution is obtained through the
application of semi-definite relaxation and Dinkelbach's method. Finally, the
user-group specific elevation beamforming scenario is devised, which offers
significant performance gains as confirmed through simulations. These results
have direct application in the analysis of 5G FD-MIMO systems.

stellar mass growth of L$*$ elliptical galaxies in the local Universe. We wish
to understand the reason for star formation in these otherwise passively
evolving red and dead stellar systems. The fuel for star formation can be
acquired through recent accretion events such as mergers or flyby. The
signatures of such events should be evident from a structural analysis of the
galaxy image. We carried out structural analysis on SDSS $r$-band imaging data
of 55 star-forming blue elliptical galaxies, derived the structural parameters,
analysed the residuals from best-fit to surface brightness distribution, and
constructed the galaxy scaling relations. We found that star-forming blue
early-type galaxies are bulge-dominated systems with axial ratio $>$ 0.5 and
surface brightness profiles fitted by Sersic profiles with index ($n$) mostly
$>$ 2. Twenty-three galaxies are found to have $n$ $<$ 2; these could be
hosting a disc component. The residual images of the 32 galaxy surface
brightness profile fits show structural features indicative of recent
interactions. The star-forming blue elliptical galaxies follow the Kormendy
relation and show the characteristics of normal elliptical galaxies as far as
structural analysis is concerned. There is a general trend for high-luminosity
galaxies to display interaction signatures and high star formation rates. The
star-forming population of blue early-type galaxies at low redshifts could be
normal ellipticals that might have undergone a recent gas-rich minor merger
event. The star formation in these galaxies will shut down once the recently
acquired fuel is consumed, following which the galaxy will evolve to a normal
early-type galaxy.

analysis of the secondary antiproton flux generated by the cosmic ray

originates from the cosmic ray propagation process and the hadronic interaction
models. Although the cosmic ray propagation parameters have been well
controlled by the AMS-02 $B/C$ ratio data for a specified model, different
propagation models can not be discriminated by the $B/C$ data. The $\bar{p}$
flux is also calculated for several hadronic interaction models, which are
generally adopted by the cosmic ray community. However, the results for
different hadronic models do not converge. We find the EPOS LHC model, which
seems to fit the collider data very well, predicts a slightly lower $\bar{p}/p$

distribute in a {\it blue plume} feature in the colour-magnitude diagram. For
the first time we confirm spectroscopically that most of these stars are early

they are not evenly distributed along the line of sight, but crowd at
heliocentric distances between 6.6 and 8.2 kpc. We compare these results with
present-day understanding of the spiral structure of the Galaxy and suggest
that they traces the outer arm. This range in distances challenges current
Galactic models adopting a disk cut-off at 14 kpc from the Galactic center. The
young dwarfs overlap in space with an older component which identifies the old
Galactic thin disk. Both young and old populations are confined in space since
the disk is warped at the latitude and longitude of Tombaugh~1. The main
effects of the warp are that the line of sight intersects the disk and entirely
crosses it at the outer arm distance, and that there are no traces of the
closer Perseus arm, which would then be either un-important in this sector, or
located much closer to the formal Galactic plane. We finally analysed a group

Universe and the dynamics reflects their symmetry-breaking mechanisms. These
cosmological defects may be probed through weak lensing effects because they
interact with ordinary matters only through the gravitational force. In this
paper, we investigate global textures by using weak lensing curl and B modes.
Non-topological textures are modeled by the non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and
induce not only the scalar perturbation but also vector and tensor
perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the nonlinearity in the
anisotropic stress of scalar fields. We show angular power spectra of curl and
B modes from both vector and tensor modes based on the NLSM. Furthermore, we
give the analytic estimations for curl and B mode power spectra. The amplitude
of weak lensing signals depends on a combined parameter $\epsilon^{2}_{v} =
N^{-1}\left( v/m_{\rm pl} \right)^{4}$ where $N$ and $v$ are the number of the
scalar fields and the vacuum expectation value, respectively. We discuss the
detectability of the curl and B modes with several observation specifications.
In the case of the CMB lensing observation without including the instrumental
noise, we can reach $\epsilon_{v} \approx 2.7\times 10^{-6}$. This constraint
is about 10 times stronger than the current one determined from the Planck. For
the cosmic shear observation, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio depends on
the mean redshift and the observing number of galaxies as $\propto z^{0.7}_{\rm

variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we
train a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief

Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) and other types of dwarf galaxies. BCDs provide ideal
laboratories to study intense star formation episodes in low mass dwarf
galaxies, and have sometimes been considered a short-lived evolutionary stage
between types of dwarf galaxies. To test these connections, we consider a
sample of BCDs as well as a comparison sample of nearby galaxies from the Local
Volume Legacy (LVL) survey for context. We fit the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distributions (SED, far-ultra-violet to far-infrared) of each galaxy
with a grid of theoretical models to determine their stellar masses and star
formation properties. We compare our results for BCDs with the LVL galaxies to
put BCDs in the context of normal galaxy evolution. The SED fits demonstrate
that the star formation events currently underway in BCDs are at the extreme of
the continuum of normal dwarf galaxies, both in terms of the relative mass
involved and in the relative increase over previous star formation rates.
Today's BCDs are distinctive objects in a state of extreme star formation which
is rapidly transforming them. This study also suggests ways to identify former
BCDs whose star formation episodes have since faded.

relatedness to improve the generalization performance for each task.
Traditionally, to perform multi-task learning, one needs to centralize data
from all the tasks to a single machine. However, in many real-world
applications, data of different tasks may be geo-distributed over different
local machines. Due to heavy communication caused by transmitting the data and
the issue of data privacy and security, it is impossible to send data of
different task to a master machine to perform multi-task learning. Therefore,
in this paper, we propose a distributed multi-task learning framework that
simultaneously learns predictive models for each task as well as task
relationships between tasks alternatingly in the parameter server paradigm. In
our framework, we first offer a general dual form for a family of regularized
multi-task relationship learning methods. Subsequently, we propose a
communication-efficient primal-dual distributed optimization algorithm to solve
the dual problem by carefully designing local subproblems to make the dual
problem decomposable. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis
for the proposed algorithm, which is specific for distributed multi-task
relationship learning. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets to evaluate our proposed framework in terms of
effectiveness and convergence.

  A CPS is an integration of networked computational and physical processes
with meaningful inter-effects; the former monitors, controls, and affects the
latter, while the latter also impacts the former. CPSs have applications in a
wide-range of systems spanning robotics, transportation, communication,
infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Many safety-critical systems such as
chemical processes, medical devices, aircraft flight control, and automotive
systems, are indeed CPS. The advanced capabilities of CPS require complex
software and synthesis algorithms, which are hard to verify. In fact, many
problems in this area are undecidable. Thus, a major step is to find particular
abstractions of such systems which might be algorithmically verifiable
regarding specific properties of such systems, describing the partial/overall
behaviors of CPSs.

for dynamical black holes, which the Noether charge construction does not

making no assumptions about the amplitude of departure from equilibrium, we

for efficient inference in small-area estimation. To measure its uncertainty,
we need to estimate its mean squared error (MSE) since the true MSE cannot
generally be derived in a closed form. The ""naive MSE estimator"", one of the
estimators available for small-area inference, is unlikely to be chosen, since
it does not achieve the desired asymptotic property, namely second-order
unbiasedness, although it maintains strict positivity and tractability.
Therefore, users tend to choose the second-order unbiased MSE estimator. In
this paper, we seek a new adjusted maximum-likelihood method to obtain a naive
MSE estimator that achieves the required asymptotic property. To obtain the
result, we also reveal the relationship between the general adjusted
maximum-likelihood method for the model variance parameter and the general
functional form of the second-order unbiased, and strictly positive, MSE
estimator. We also compare the performance of the new method with that of the
existing naive estimator through a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results
show that the new method remedies the underestimation associated with the

two colonels simultaneously distribute their troops across different

battlefields he wins. This game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range of
applications such as the U.S presidential election, innovative technology

finding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. After almost a
century Ahmadinejad, Dehghani, Hajiaghayi, Lucier, Mahini, and Seddighin
provided a poly-time algorithm for finding the optimal strategies. They first
model the problem by a Linear Program (LP) and use Ellipsoid method to solve
it. However, despite the theoretical importance of their algorithm, it is
highly impractical. In general, even Simplex method (despite its exponential
running-time) performs better than Ellipsoid method in practice. In this paper,
we provide the first polynomial-size LP formulation of the optimal strategies

speaking, we project the strategy space polytope to a higher dimensional space,

further show this representation is asymptotically tight in terms of the number

and solved efficiently. We next establish an interesting connection between
$N$-tier HetNets and single-tier networks. Unlike the single-tier network where
the optimal performance only depends on the cache size, the optimal performance
of $N$-tier HetNets depends also on the BS densities. The performance upper
bound is, however, determined by an equivalent single-tier network. We further
show that with uniform caching probabilities regardless of content
popularities, to achieve a target SDP, the BS density of a tier can be reduced
by increasing the cache size of the tier when the cache size is larger than a
threshold; otherwise the BS density and BS cache size can be increased
simultaneously. It is also found analytically that the BS density of a tier is
inverse to the BS cache size of the same tier and is linear to BS cache sizes
of other tiers.

be contributed by intrinsic chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions and/or extrinsic
effects, such as superimposition of Hall signals, field-dependent inhomogeneous
current flow in the bulk, i.e. current jetting, and weak localization (WL) of
coexistent trivial carriers. Such WL controlled NMR is heavily dependent on
sample quality, and is characterized by pronounced crossover from positive to
negative MR growth at elevated temperatures, as a result of the competition
between the phase coherence time and the spin-orbital scattering constant of
the bulk trivial pockets. Thus, the correlation of NMR and chiral anomaly needs
to be scrutinized, without the support of other complimentary techniques. Due
to the lifting of spin degeneracy, the spin orientations of Weyl fermions are
either parallel or antiparallel to the momentum, a unique physical property
known as helicity. The conservation of helicity provides strong protection for
the transport of Weyl fermions, which can only be effectively scattered by
magnetic impurities. Chemical doping of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities
are thus more convincing in probing the existence of Weyl fermions than the NMR
method.

decoding algorithm in high dimensions over an AWGN channel. Considering
Construction D' of lattices with one binary LDPC code as underlying code gives
the well known Construction A LDPC lattices or 1-level LDPC lattices.
Block-fading channel (BF) is a useful model for various wireless communication
channels in both indoor and outdoor environments. Frequency-hopping schemes and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can conveniently be modelled
as block-fading channels. Applying lattices in this type of channel entails
dividing a lattice point into multiple blocks such that fading is constant
within a block but changes, independently, across blocks. The design of
lattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly
from its counterparts like AWGN channels. Recently, the original binary
Construction A for lattices, due to Forney, have been generalized to a lattice
construction from totally real and complex multiplication fields. This
generalized Construction A of lattices provides signal space diversity
intrinsically, which is the main requirement for the signal sets designed for
fading channels. In this paper we construct full diversity LDPC lattices for
block-fading channels using Construction A over totally real number fields. We
propose a new iterative decoding method for these family of lattices which has
complexity that grows linearly in the dimension of the lattice. In order to
implement our decoding algorithm, we propose the definition of a parity check

probes massive structures on large scales, allowing us to understand the
late-time evolution of the Universe. One way to extract the cosmological
information from WL is to use peak statistics. Peaks are tracers of massive
halos and therefore probe the mass function. They retain non-Gaussian
information and have already been shown as a promising tool to constrain
cosmology. In this work, we develop a new model to predict WL peak counts. The
model generates fast simulations based on halo sampling and selects peaks from
the derived lensing maps. This approach has three main advantages. First, the
model is very fast: only several seconds are required to perform a realization.
Second, including realistic conditions is straightforward. Third, the model
provides the full distribution information because of its stochasticity. We
show that our model agrees well with N-body simulations. Then, we study the
impacts of the cosmology-dependent covariance on constraints and explore
different parameter inference methods. A special focus is put on approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC), an accept-reject sampler without the need to
estimate the likelihood. We show that ABC is able to yield robust constraints
with much reduced time costs. Several filtering techniques are studied to
improve the extraction of multiscale information. Finally, the new model is
applied to the CFHTLenS, KiDS DR1/2, and DES SV data sets. Our preliminary
results agree with the Planck constraints assuming the Lambda-CDM model.
Overall, this thesis forges an innovative tool for future WL surveys. The
manuscript provides a brief review on WL peak counts.

it can determine the rate of photo-z outliers at a level of 0.01-1% merely

on the techniques of fixed-point iteration and non-negative matrix
factorization, the proposed algorithm can efficiently and robustly reconstruct
the scattering probabilities between the true-z and photo-z bins. The algorithm
has been tested extensively by applying it to mock data from simulated stage IV

recovery of the scatter rates at the level of 0.01-1%, and the true mean
redshifts of photo-z bins at the level of 0.001, which may satisfy the

survey covered 4.5 deg$^2$ of the SMC with $1\sigma$ noise levels of $5-12$ mJy
beam$^{-1}$, and 44 extended objects were identified. The 1.1 mm extended
emission has good spatial correlation with $Herschel$ 160 $\mathrm{\mu m}$,
indicating that the origin of the 1.1 mm extended emission is thermal emission
from a cold dust component. We estimated physical properties using the 1.1 mm
and filtered $Herschel$ data (100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mathrm{\mu m}$).
The 1.1 mm objects show dust temperatures of $17-45$ K and gas masses of
$4\times10^3-3\times10^5~M_\odot$, assuming single-temperature thermal emission
from the cold dust with an emissivity index, $\beta$, of 1.2 and a gas-to-dust
ratio of 1000. These physical properties are very similar to those of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) in our galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The 1.1
mm objects also displayed good spatial correlation with the $Spitzer$ 24
$\mathrm{\mu m}$ and CO emission, suggesting that the 1.1 mm objects trace the
dense gas regions as sites of massive star formation. The dust temperature of
the 1.1 mm objects also demonstrated good correlation with the 24 $\mathrm{\mu
m}$ flux connected to massive star formation. This supports the hypothesis that
the heating source of the cold dust is mainly local star-formation activity in
the 1.1 mm objects. The classification of the 1.1 mm objects based on the
existence of star-formation activity reveals the differences in the dust
temperature, gas mass, and radius, which reflects the evolution sequence of

finiteness of the baths of multiple conserved quantities. Then, we investigate
how the optimal performance of generalized heat engines with multiple conserved
quantities alters in response to the size of the baths. In the context of
general theories of quantum thermodynamics, the size of the baths has been
given in terms of the number of identical copies of a system, which does not
cover even such a natural scaling as the volume. In consideration of the
asymptotic extensivity, we deal with a generic scaling of the baths to
naturally include the volume scaling. Based on it, we derive a bound for the
performance of generalized heat engines reflecting finite-size effects of the
baths, which we call fine-grained generalized Carnot bound. We also construct a
protocol to achieve the optimal performance of the engine given by this bound.
Finally, applying the obtained general theory, we deal with simple examples of
generalized heat engines. As for an example of non-i.i.d.~scaling and multiple
conserved quantities, we investigate a heat engine with two baths composed of
an ideal gas exchanging particles, where the volume scaling is applied. The
result implies that the mass of the particle explicitly affects the performance
of this engine with finite-size baths.

contrast, a density-potential functional description that effectively
incorporates interactions provides unambiguous gradient corrections. Employing
an averaging procedure that involves Airy functions, thereby partially
resumming higher-order gradient corrections, we facilitate a smooth transition
of the particle density into the classically forbidden region of arbitrary
smooth potentials. We find excellent agreement of the semiclassical
Airy-averaged particle densities with the exact densities for very low but
finite temperatures, illustrated for a Fermi gas with harmonic potential
energy. We furthermore provide criteria for the applicability of the
semiclassical expansions at low temperatures. Finally, we derive a well-behaved
ground-state kinetic-energy functional, which improves on the Thomas-Fermi

microscopic model is based on an optimal velocity function and a reaction time
parameter. The corresponding macroscopic formulations in Eulerian or Lagrangian
coordinates result in first order convection-diffusion equations. More
precisely, the convection is described by the optimal velocity while the
diffusion term depends on the reaction time. A linear stability analysis for
homogeneous solutions of both continuous and discrete models are provided. The
conditions match the ones of the car-following model for specific values of the
space discretization. The behavior of the novel model is illustrated thanks to
numerical simulations. Transitions to collision-free self-sustained stop-and-go
dynamics are obtained if the reaction time is sufficiently large. The results
show that the dynamics of the microscopic model can be well captured by the

very short but finite interval sampling. The resulting samples form a signal
vector for symbol detection. The upper and lower bounds on transmission rate of
such a processing system are studied. It is shown that the gap between two
bounds approaches zero as the thermal noise and shot noise variances approach
zero. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) signal detection is performed and a low
computational complexity receiver is derived under piecewise polynomial
approximation. Meanwhile, the threshold based signal detection is also studied,
where two threshold selection rules are proposed based on the detection error
probability and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. For the latter, it is shown
that the KL distance is not sensitive to the threshold selection for small shot
and thermal noise variances, and thus the threshold can be selected among a
wide range without significant loss from the optimal KL distance. The
performances of the transmission rate bounds, the signal detection, and the
threshold selection approaches are evaluated by the numerical results.

learn a low-dimensional vector representation of hash-tags (Tag2Vec) using a

video features to the low-dimensional Tag2vec space. We learn this embedding
for 29 categories of short video clips with hash-tags. A query video without
any tag-information can then be directly mapped to the vector space of tags
using the learned embedding and relevant tags can be found by performing a
simple nearest-neighbor retrieval in the Tag2Vec space. We validate the

into triangles. Two necessary conditions for $G$ to admit such a decomposition
are that $|E(G)|$ is a multiple of three and that the degree of any vertex in
$G$ is even; we call such graphs tridivisible.
  Kirkman's work on Steiner triple systems established that for $G \simeq K_n$,
$G$ admits a triangle decomposition precisely when $G$ is tridivisible. In
1970, Nash-Williams conjectured that tridivisiblity is also sufficient for
""almost-complete"" graphs, which for this talk's purposes we interpret as any
graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq (1 -\epsilon)n, E(G) \geq (1 -
\xi)\binom{n}{2}$ for some appropriately small constants $\epsilon, \xi$.
Nash-Williams conjectured that $\epsilon = \xi =1/4$ would suffice; in 1991,
Gustavsson demonstrated in his dissertation that $\epsilon = \xi < 10^{-24}$
suffices for all $n \equiv 3, 9 \mod 18$, and in 2015 Keevash's work on the
existence conjecture for combinatorial designs established that some value of
$\epsilon$ existed for any $n$.
  In this paper, we prove that for any $\epsilon < \frac{1}{432}$, there is a
constant $\xi$ such that any $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq (1 - \epsilon)n$ and
$|E(G)| \geq (1 - \xi)\binom{n}{2}$ admits such a decomposition, and offer an
algorithm that explicitly constructs such a triangulation. Moreover, we note
that our algorithm runs in polynomial time on such graphs. (This last
observation contrasts with Holyer's result that finding triangle decompositions
in general is a NP-complete problem.)

these patterns and factors, to assess the relevant uncertainty sources, and to
describe disease in the population. Thus disease spread at the population level
differs from the approach traditionally taken by veterinary practitioners that
are principally concerned with the health status of the individual. Patterns of

a band gap reduction from mono- to bilayer, and then to a semiconductor-metal

marked a milestone for particle physics. Yet, there are still many open
questions that cannot be answered within the Standard Model (SM). For example,
the generation of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe
through baryogenesis can only be explained qualitatively in the SM. A simple
extension of the SM compatible with the current theoretical and experimental
constraints is given by the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) where a second Higgs
doublet is added to the Higgs sector. We investigate the possibility of a
strong first order electroweak phase transition in the CP-conserving 2HDM type
I and type II where either of the CP-even Higgs bosons is identified with the
SM-like Higgs boson. The renormalisation that we apply on the loop-corrected
Higgs potential allows us to efficiently scan the 2HDM parameter space and
simultaneously take into account all relevant theoretical and up-to-date
experimental constraints. The 2HDM parameter regions found to be compatible
with the applied constraints and a strong electroweak phase transition are
analysed systematically. Our results show that there is a strong interplay
between the requirement of a strong phase transition and collider phenomenology
with testable implications for searches at the LHC.

a parameter vector that includes the underlying parameters of this process

for example, that even if in both steps of the estimation procedure we have
identifiability in a certain sense it does not necessarily carry over to the
plug-in models.

outcome of this event, we study multi-wavelength images and dynamic radio
spectra and quantitatively reconcile the findings with each other. An
additional eruption probably occurred in the same active region about half an
hour before the main eruption. The latter produced two blast-wave-like shocks
during the impulsive phase. The two shock waves eventually merged around the
radial direction into a single shock traced up to $25R_\odot$ as a halo ahead
of the expanding CME body, in agreement with an interplanetary Type II event
recorded by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) experiment on the
Wind spacecraft. The shape and kinematics of the halo indicate an intermediate
regime of the shock between the blast wave and bow shock at these distances.
The results show that i) the shock wave appeared during the flare rise and
could accelerate particles earlier than usually assumed; ii) the particle event
could be amplified by the preceding eruption, which stretched closed structures
above the developing CME, facilitated its lift-off and escape of
flare-accelerated particles, enabled a higher CME speed and stronger shock
ahead; iii) escape of flare-accelerated particles could be additionally
facilitated by reconnection of the flux rope, where they were trapped, with a
large coronal hole; iv) the first eruption supplied a rich seed population
accelerated by a trailing shock wave.

speed of gravitational waves (GWs) based on strongly lensed GWs and their

arrival times of GWs and their EM counterparts and by comparing the time delays
between images seen in GWs and their EM counterparts. The lensed GW-EM event is
perhaps the best way to identify an EM counterpart. Conceptually, this method
does not rely on any specific theory of massive gravitons or modified gravity.
Its differential setting (i.e., measuring the difference between time delays in
GW and EM domains) makes it robust against lens modeling details (photons and
GWs travel in the same lensing potential) and against internal time delays
between GW and EM emission acts. It requires, however, that the theory of
gravity is metric and predicts gravitational lensing similar to general
relativity. We expect that such a test will become possible in the era of
third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, when about 10 lensed GW events
would be observed each year. The power of this method is mainly limited by the

the Weyl invariance of the metric equations of motion independently of the
invariance of the action. Then, we study another set of models with scalar
fields and show that solutions to the equations of motion are either trivial or

difficulties involved. POLAR is a dedicated polarimeter designed to perform

burst in the 50-500 keV energy range. This new polarimeter is expected to
detect approximately 50 gamma-ray bursts per year while performing high
precision polarization measurements on approximately 10 bursts per year. The
instrument was launched into lower earth orbit as part of the second Chinese
space lab, the Tiangong-2, on September 15th 2016 and has been taking data
successfully since being switched on one week after. The instrument uses a
segmented scintillator array consisting of 1600 plastic scintillator bars, read
out by 25 flat-panel multi-anode photomultipliers, to measure the Compton
scattering angles of incoming photons. The small segmentation and relatively
large uniform effective area allow the instrument to measure the polarization
of a large number of transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts, with an
unprecedented precision during its two year life-time. The final flight model

qualification tests, a summary of which will be presented in this paper. The

Moreover, each voter should have equal influence. Traditionally, this has been
achieved by permitting voters to cast at most one ballot. More recently, this
has been achieved by tallying the last ballot cast by each voter. We show this
is not achieved by the Helios election system, because an adversary can cause a

infiltration gives an infiltration length that varies with the square root of
time, reactive infiltration is characterised by a linear relationship between
the two magnitudes. In addition the infiltration rate in the latter is at least
two orders of magnitude greater than in the former.
  This work is addressed to investigate imbibition of a non-wetting, albeit
reactive, liquid into a capillary, within the framework of a simple model that
includes capillarity effects, viscosity and gravity. The capillary radius is
allowed to vary, due to reaction, with both position and time, according to
either an interface or a diffusion law. The model allows for capillary closure
when reaction kinetics dominates imbibition. At short times, and depending on
whether infiltration is capillarity or gravity controlled, the infiltrated
length varies either as the square root or linearly with time. This suggest the
following track for reactive infiltration: i) In most cases, the contact angle
is initially larger than $90^\circ$, ii) after some time, reaction gradually
replaces the interface liquid/preform by the liquid/reaction product interface
and, concomitantly, the contact angle gets closer to $90^\circ$, iii) beyond
that time, gravity triggers infiltration (actually the contact angle does not
need to be smaller than $90^\circ$ for the initiation of infiltration due to
the metallostatic pressure exerted by the liquid metal on top of the porous
preform), iv) thereafter infiltration is controlled by viscosity and gravity,
provided that, due to reaction, the contact angle remains close to that at
which infiltration was initiated.

many mobile applications, including dynamic adjustment of screen on-off, screen
resolution, screen luminance, font size, with the purposes of power saving,
protection of human eyesight, etc. Existing detection techniques for
face-screen distance depend on external or internal hardware, e.g., an
accessory plug-in sensor (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic sensors) to measure the
face-screen distance, a built-in proximity sensor that usually outputs a
coarse-grained, two-valued, proximity index (for the purpose of powering on/off
the screen), etc. In this paper, we present a fine-grained detection method,
called ""Look Into My Eyes (LIME)"", that utilizes the front camera and inertial
accelerometer of the smartphone to estimate the facescreen distance.
Specifically, LIME captures the photo of the user's face only when the
accelerometer detects certain motion patterns of mobile phones, and then
estimates the face-screen distance by looking at the distance between the
user's eyes. Besides, LIME is able to take care of the user experience when
multiple users are facing the phone screen. The experimental results show that
LIME can achieve a mean squared error smaller than 2.4 cm in all of
experimented scenarios, and it incurs a small cost on battery life when
integrated into an SMS application for enabling dynamic font size by detecting
the face-screen distance.

flow is addressed by considering the problem in which an interface separating
two regions with different constant densities is stabilised within a
stagnation-point flow. The existence of an analytic solution for the
two-dimensional incompressible flow field allows the exact derivation of the
velocity gradient tensor and of parameters describing the local flow topology.
Stirring properties are affected not only through vorticity production and jump
of strain intensity at the interface, but also through rotation of strain
principal axes resulting from anisotropy of pressure Hessian. The strain
persistence parameter, which measures the respective effects of strain and
effective rotation (vorticity plus rotation rate of strain basis), reveals a
complex structure. In particular, for large values of the density ratio it
indicates dominating effective rotation in a restricted area past the
interface. Information on flow structure derived from the Okubo-Weiss
parameter, by contrast, is less detailed. The influence of the density step on
stirring properties is assessed through the Lagrangian evolution of the
gradient of a passive scalar. Even for a moderate density ratio, alignment of
the scalar gradient and growth rate of its norm are deeply altered. Past the
interface effective rotation indeed drives the scalar gradient to align with a
direction determined by the local strain persistence parameter, away from the
compressional strain direction. The jump of strain intensity at the interface,
however, opposes the lessening effect of the latter mechanism on the growth
rate of the scalar gradient norm and promotes the rise of the gradient.

  methods",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moving mesh methods provide an efficient way of solving partial differential
equations for which large, localised variations in the solution necessitate
locally dense spatial meshes. In one-dimension, meshes are typically specified
using the arclength mesh density function. This choice is well-justified for
piecewise polynomial interpolants, but it is only justified for spectral
methods when model solutions include localised steep gradients. In this paper,
one-dimensional mesh density functions are presented which are based on a
spatially localised measure of the bandwidth of the approximated model
solution. In considering bandwidth, these mesh density functions are
well-justified for spectral methods, but are not strictly tied to the error
properties of any particular spatial interpolant, and are hence widely
applicable. The bandwidth mesh density functions are demonstrated by applying
periodic spectral and finite-difference moving mesh methods to a number of
model problems in acoustics. These problems include a heterogeneous advection
equation, the viscous Burgers' equation, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
Simulation results demonstrate solution convergence rates that are up to an
order of magnitude faster using the bandwidth mesh density functions than
uniform meshes, and around three times faster than those using the arclength
mesh density function.

topology from a topological and observational perspective. Beginning with an
overview of the basic concepts of cosmology, it is observed that though a
determinant of local curvature, Einstein's equations of relativity do not
constrain the global properties of space-time. The topological requirements of
a universal space time manifold are discussed, including requirements of
space-time orientability and causality. The basic topological concepts used in
classification of spaces, i.e. the concept of the Fundamental Domain and
Universal covering spaces are discussed briefly. The manifold properties and
symmetry groups for three dimensional manifolds of constant curvature for
negative, positive and zero curvature manifolds are laid out.
Multi-connectedness is explored as a possible explanation for the detected
anomalies in the quadrupole and octopole regions of the power spectrum,
pointing at a possible compactness along one or more directions in space. The
statistical significance of the evidence, however, is also scrutinized and I
discuss briefly the bayesian and frequentist interpretation of the posterior
probabilities of observing the anomalies in a Lambda CDM universe. Some of the
major topologies that have been proposed and investigated as possible
candidates of a universal manifold are the Poincare Dodecahedron and Bianchi
Universes, which are studied in detail. Lastly, the methods that have been
proposed for detecting a multi connected signature are discussed. These include
ingenious observational methods like the circles in the sky method, cosmic
crystallography and Bayesian Analysis which provides the additional advantage
of being free from measurement errors and uses the posterior likelihoods of
models. As of the recent Planck mission, no pressing evidence of a multi
connected topology has been detected.

environment that can be dynamically adjusted. Here the qubit is coupled to a
thermal bath through a tunable harmonic oscillator. On-demand initialization is
achieved by sweeping the oscillator rapidly into resonance with the qubit. This
resonant coupling with the engineered environment induces fast relaxation to
the ground state of the system, and a consecutive rapid sweep back to off
resonance guarantees weak excess dissipation during quantum computations. We
solve the corresponding quantum dynamics using a Markovian master equation for
the reduced density operator of the qubit-bath system. This allows us to
optimize the parameters and the initialization protocol for the qubit. Our
analytical calculations show that the ground-state occupation of our system is
well protected during the fast sweeps of the environmental coupling and,
consequently, we obtain an estimate for the duration of our protocol by solving
the transition rates between the low-energy eigenstates with the Jacobian
diagonalization method. Our results suggest that the current experimental state
of the art for the initialization speed of superconducting qubits at a given
fidelity can be considerably improved.

Waals equation of state for mixtures. The model consists of parabolic equations
with cross diffusion with a hypocoercive diffusion operator. The global-in-time
existence of weak solutions in a bounded domain with equilibrium boundary

free energy inequality, the large-time convergence of the solution to the

catalysts in the petrochemical industry. Zeolite catalytic functionality is
coupled to the distribution of tetrahedral alumina (AlO4-) and associated
counter-cations throughout the aluminosilicate framework, yet little is
definitively known about the factors that govern framework aluminium
arrangement. It is generally accepted that all zeolites obey Lowensteins rule
of aluminium avoidance and that Al-O-Al linkages are forbidden. Here, we
describe the unprecedented screening of aluminium distribution in catalytically
active zeolite SSZ-13 in both its protonated and sodium containing forms,
H-SSZ-13 and Na-SSZ-13, using density functional theory. We predict violations
of Lowensteins rule in high and low silica H-SSZ-13 and other protonated
frameworks considered in this investigation, H-LTA, H-RHO and H-ABW. The
synthetic realisation of these zeolites could spur the development of new
catalytic routes and materials, and the optimisation of existing zeolite
catalysts.

Transfer (SWIPT) over a fading multiple access channel with additive Gaussian
noise. The transmitters as well as the receiver harvest energy from ambient

delay sensitive and delay tolerant data. Each transmitter sends the delay
sensitive data at a certain minimum rate irrespective of the channel conditions
(fading states). In addition, if the channel conditions are good, the delay
tolerant data is sent. {Along with data, the transmitters also transfer power
to aid the receiver in meeting its energy requirements.} In this setting, we
characterize the \textit{minimum-rate capacity region} which provides the
fundamental limit of transferring information and power simultaneously with
minimum rate guarantees. Owing to the limitations of current technology, these
limits might not be achievable in practice. Among the practical receiver
structures proposed for SWIPT in literature, two popular architectures are the
\textit{time switching} and \textit{power splitting} receivers. For each of
these architectures, we derive the minimum-rate capacity regions. We show that
power splitting receivers although more complex, provide a larger capacity

Jupiters, we find that the WASP-53 and WASP-81 systems also host brown dwarfs,
on fairly eccentric orbits with semi-major axes of a few astronomical units.
WASP-53c is over 16 $M_{\rm Jup} \sin i_{\rm c}$ and WASP-81c is 57 $M_{\rm

theories of how the inner planets were assembled. We propose two alternative
interpretations: a formation of the hot Jupiters within the snow line, or the
late dynamical arrival of the brown dwarfs after disc-dispersal.
  We also attempted to measure the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect for both hot

is tunnel-coupled to an electronic lead and a metallic island. A background
reservoir keeps the metallic island at a thermal state with the ambient
temperature, while the charge accumulated on the island is reflected in a
time-dependent chemical potential. Without feedback, a current would flow
through the system until the chemical potentials of island and lead are
equilibrated. A feedback loop can be implemented by a quantum point contact
detecting the dot state, classical processing of the result and appropriate
feedback actions on the electronic tunneling rates taken, with the objective to
direct the current in a preferred direction. Since we directly take the
detector counting statistics into account, this automatically includes
measurement errors in the description. When mainly the rates are modified but
hardly any energy is exchanged with the system, this feedback loop effectively
implements a Maxwell demon, capable of transporting electrons against an
electric bias and thereby charging the metallic island. Once the feedback
protocol is stopped, the metallic island simply discharges. We find that a
quantitative detector model may be useful for a realistic statistical

dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval
mechanism. Two different models can account for one of the main predictions of
interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a
feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005)
activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though
these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on
different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between
reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the
assumptions of ACT-R, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race
between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model,
accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval
time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes
a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval varies between items;
in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility and
repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian
hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that
some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than
under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule
out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with
assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show
that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming
that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only
slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect
items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access
model.

elusive, with a few candidates whose high-$z$ nature is still to be confirmed.
Interpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of
high-$z$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work,
we present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking
into account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich
systems at high-$z$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample
of active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the
progenitors of a $z \sim 6$ SMBH with $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^9 \, M_\odot$. We
find an average Compton thick fraction of $\sim 45\%$ and large typical column
densities ($N_H \gtrsim 10^{23} \rm \, cm^2$). However, faint progenitors are
still luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even
accounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is
reduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint
quasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction ($f_{\rm act} \sim
1 \%$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We
suggest that to detect high-$z$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with
shallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be
preferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.

to the unitary plus low rank case by using a block analogue of the CMV form of
unitary matrices. It is shown that a block Lanczos-type procedure for the block

range of atmospheric phenomena, with stable wind patterns, changing storms, and
evolving anomalies. Brown dwarfs also exhibit atmospheric variability. Such
temporal variability in the atmosphere of a giant exoplanet has not to date
been observed. HAT-P-7 b is an exoplanet with a known offset in the peak of its

-0.086+0.033-0.033 to 0.143+0.040-0.037 in phase, implying that the peak
brightness repeatedly shifts from one side of the planet's substellar point to
the other. The variability occurs on a timescale of tens to hundreds of days.
These shifts in brightness are indicative of variability in the planet's
atmosphere, and result from a changing balance of thermal emission and
reflected flux from the planet's dayside. We suggest that variation in wind
speed in the planetary atmosphere, leading to variable cloud coverage on the
dayside and a changing energy balance, is capable of explaining the observed
variation.

stochastic metric space is, in brief, a metric space whose metric tensor is
given stochastically according to some appropriate distribution function. A
mathematically consistent model of a space time manifold equipping a stochastic
metric is proposed in this report. The quantum theory in the local Minkowski
space can be recognized as a classical theory on the stochastic
Lorentz-metric-space. A stochastic calculus on the space time manifold is
performed using white noise functional analysis. A path-integral quantization
is introduced as a stochastic integration of a function of the action integral,

mathematically well-defined for large variety of potential functions. The
Newton--Nelson equation of motion can also be obtained from the Newtonian
equation of motion on the stochastic metric space. It is also shown that the
commutation relation required under the canonical quantization is consistent

use of the stochastic metrics. Some example of quantum effects on the universe

unsolved. This is particularly relevant in the context of entanglement entropy,
where VEVs of branch-point twist fields give universal saturation predictions.
We propose a new method to compute VEVs of twist fields associated to
continuous symmetries in QFT. The method is based on a differential equation in
the continuous symmetry parameter, and gives VEVs as infinite form-factor
series which truncate at two-particle level in free QFT. We verify the method
by studying U(1) twist fields in free models, which are simply related to the
branch-point twist fields. We provide the first exact formulae for the VEVs of
such fields in the massive uncompactified free boson model, checking against an
independent calculation based on angular quantization. We show that logarithmic
terms, overlooked in the original work of Callan and Wilczek [Phys. Lett. B333

implies that, in agreement with numerical form-factor observations by Bianchini
and Castro-Alvaredo [Nucl. Phys. B913 (2016)], the standard power-law
short-distance behavior is corrected by a logarithmic factor. We discuss how
this gives universal formulae for the saturation of entanglement entropy of a

attached to the sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model
uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition
logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift
registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse
train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that
consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive
the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these
individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the
ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of
getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.
They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for
each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an
object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of
the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed
in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add
plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the
animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve
that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow
the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using
permanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,
information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one
logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)

in the framework of fractional calculus. The compressional wave equation and
the shear wave equation derived from the GS model are shown to take the form of
the Kelvin-Voigt fractional-derivative wave equation and the fractional

the dispersion relations obtained from the fractional framework and those from
the GS model to establish the equivalence of the respective wave equations.
Further, a physical interpretation of the characteristic fractional order
present in the wave equations is inferred from the GS model. The overall goal
is to show that fractional calculus is not just a mathematical framework which
can be used to curve-fit the complex behavior of materials. Rather, it can also
be derived from real physical processes as illustrated in this work by the

Conference in the Buda Castle on October 30, 2015, Budapest, Hungary. The human
development on the Earth is analysed based on basic physical principles and the
available resources. The areal and material resources are obviously finite, but
the very fundamental energy resources are sufficient for solid and sustainable
continuing development. These energy resources can compensate many of the
constraints arising from the finite material resources. The development is
going in the direction of increasing complexity on the surface of the Earth,
due to the increasing green mass and the developing biological and material
complex structures. This sustainable development is enabled by the
astrophysical conditions and constraints and these conditions provide a good
possibility for continuous further development in a sustainable way. This
development is characterized by the increasing neg-entropy on the surface of
the Earth.

under an applied magnetic field in the c direction perpendicular to the film.
The helical structure is due to the an-tiferromagnetic interaction between
next-nearest neighbors in the c direction. Helimagnetic films in zero field are
known to have a strong modification of the in-plane helical angle near the film
surfaces. We show that spins react to a moderate applied magnetic field by
creating a particular spin configuration along the c axis. With increasing
temperature (T), using Monte Carlo simulations we show that the system
undergoes a phase transition triggered by the destruction of the ordering of a
number of layers. This partial phase transition is shown to be intimately
related to the ground-state spin structure. We show why some layers undergo a
phase transition while others do not. The Green's function method for non
collinear magnets is also carried out to investigate effects of quantum
fluctuations. Non-uniform zero-point spin contractions and a crossover of layer
magnetizations at low T are shown and discussed.

impact of noise on emotion classification is not well understood. This is
important because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone
technology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the
outside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate
background noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for
emotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently
proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion
recognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with
eight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16% smaller
run-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date.
This result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate
further studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on
smartphones.

  Atlantic using waveform cross correlation",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We apply cross correlation between multichannel seismic waveforms as a
technique for signal detection and automatic event building at the
International Data Centre (IDC). This technique allows detecting signals with
amplitudes by at least a factor of two lower than those found in the current
version of IDC processing. Previously, we processed with a cross correlation
detector aftershock sequences of a large earthquake with thousands of
aftershocks detected by the International Monitoring System (IMS) and a
middle-size earthquake (hundreds of aftershocks). Our study has revealed that
the official Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) of the IDC misses from 50% to 70%
valid seismic events. Since the IDC is a major contributor to the International
Seismological Centre (ISC) these extra events together with the associated
arrivals are missing from the ISC bulletin which is an open data source for the
broader seismological and geophysical community.Here, we assess the ultimate
resolution of the cross correlation technique with specific IDC constraints.
The aftershock sequence of the October 5, 2011 mb(IDC)4.2 earthquake in the
North Atlantic is an example of a weak sequence and includes only 38 REB
events. The number and quality of these REB events, which are used as master
events, allow conducting a comprehensive interactive review by experienced
analysts of all event hypotheses obtained by the cross correlation technique.
In an iterative procedure starting from the main shock, all 38 REB events were
found and analysts added 26 REB events. Therefore, the cross correlation
pipeline reduces the detection threshold by a factor of 2 to 3 and
approximately doubles the number of events in the REB, and thus, in the ISC
bulletin for the North Atlantic.

power budget for on-chip communication is steadily rising. Furthermore, the
increasing number of cores is placing a huge performance burden on the
network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular
architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible
topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy
costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid
NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable
nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a
detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write Multi-Read (MWMR)
nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss
the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs.
We then study explore the design space at the network level, by varying the
waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry
out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from
synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results
indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0x or
energy improvements of up to 1.37x over the base electronic network.
