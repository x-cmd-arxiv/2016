with memory. In this paper, we present a quantum description of memristive
systems. Using this model we propose and experimentally demonstrate a simple
and practical scheme for realising memristive systems with quantum dots. The
approach harnesses a phenomenon that is commonly seen as a bane of
nanoelectronics, i.e. switching of a trapped charge in the vicinity of the
device. We show that quantum-dot memristive systems have hysteresis
current-voltage characteristics and quantum jump induced stochastic behaviour.
Realising such a quantum memristor completes the menu of components for quantum
circuit design.

to most quantum communication protocols. Unfortunately, decoherence effects
such as phase noise in optical fibers are known to demolish entanglement.
Iterative (multistep) entanglement distillation protocols have long been
proposed to overcome decoherence, but their probabilistic nature makes them
inefficient since the success probability decays exponentially with the number
of steps. Quantum memories have been contemplated to make entanglement
distillation practical, but suitable quantum memories are not realised to date.
Here, we present the theory for an efficient iterative entanglement
distillation protocol without quantum memories and provide a proof-of-principle
experimental demonstration. The scheme is applied to phase-diffused
two-mode-squeezed states and proven to distill entanglement for up to three
iteration steps. The data are indistinguishable from those an efficient scheme
using quantum memories would produce. Since our protocol includes the final
measurement it is particularly promising for enhancing continuous-variable
quantum key distribution.

optimization. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimistic methods and
multi-objective optimization. In particular, this paper is concerned with
solving black-box multi-objective problems given a finite number of function
evaluations and proposes an optimistic approach, which we refer to as the
Multi-Objective Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (MO-SOO). Popularized by
multi-armed bandits, MO-SOO follows the optimism in the face of uncertainty
principle to recognize Pareto optimal solutions, by combining several
multi-armed bandits in a hierarchical structure over the feasible decision
space of a multi-objective problem. Based on three assumptions about the
objective functions smoothness and hierarchical partitioning, the algorithm
finite-time and asymptotic convergence behaviors are analyzed. The finite-time
analysis establishes an upper bound on the Pareto-compliant unary additive
epsilon indicator characterized by the objectives smoothness as well as the
structure of the Pareto front with respect to its extrema. On the other hand,
the asymptotic analysis indicates the consistency property of MO-SOO. Moreover,
we validate the theoretical provable performance of the algorithm on a set of
synthetic problems. Finally, three-hundred bi-objective benchmark problems from
the literature are used to substantiate the performance of the optimistic
approach and compare it with three state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms,
namely MOEA/D, MO-CMA-ES, and SMS-EMOA in terms of two Pareto-compliant quality
indicators. Besides sound theoretical properties, MO-SOO shows a performance on
a par with the top performing stochastic algorithm, viz. SMS-EMOA.

based on a large sample of 2,700 quasars, measured at several different epochs,
extracted from the fifth release of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source
Catalogue. Methods. We quantified the spectral variability through the
parameter $\beta$ defined as the ratio between the change in the photon index
$\Gamma$ and the corresponding logarithmic flux variation,
$\beta=-\Delta\Gamma/\Delta\log F_X$. Results. Our analysis confirms a softer
when brighter behaviour for our sample, extending the previously found general
trend to high luminosity and redshift. We estimate an ensemble value of the
spectral variability parameter $\beta=-0.69\pm0.03$. We do not find dependence
of $\beta$ on redshift, X-ray luminosity, black hole mass or Eddington ratio. A
subsample of radio-loud sources shows a smaller spectral variability parameter.
There is also some change with the X-ray flux, with smaller $\beta$ (in
absolute value) for brighter sources. We also find significant correlations for
a small number of individual sources, indicating more negative values for some
sources.

ultrahigh vacuum environment. Irradiation was carried out at room temperature
with 1 MeV Si+ ions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) were employed for analysis. With increasing ion fluence ion
beam mixing occurs and more and more Si is incorporated into the Ni layer and
this layer gets amorphized. At an even higher fluence a recrystallized uniform
nickel monosilicide ({\eta}-NiSi) layer is formed. Several planar spacings of
different Miller indices of {\eta}-NiSi have been observed in XRD and TEM.
Additionally, an oscillatory amorphization and recrystallization has been
observed in the substrate Si with increasing ion fluence. To our knowledge,
this has never been observed in ion irradiation of bare Si in decades of work
in this area. The oscillatory amorphization/recrystallization in Si is
apparently Ni-induced. Irradiation displaces Ni and produces a distribution of
Ni in amorphized Si. Irradiation at a higher fluence produces two
recrystallized Si bands in amorphous Si with concomitant accumulation of Ni at
the amorphous/crystalline interfaces. On further increase of irradiation
fluence the recrystallized Si bands again pass through amorphization and
recrystallization. The total thickness of recrystallized as well as amorphous
Si shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of ion fluence.

high-dimensional, non-Gaussian inputs suffer from a rapid (e.g., exponential)
increase of computational cost, an issue known as the curse of dimensionality.
In astrodynamics, this results in reduced accuracy when propagating an
orbit-state probability density function. This paper considers the application
of separated representations for orbit uncertainty propagation, where future
states are expanded into a sum of products of univariate functions of initial
states and other uncertain parameters. An accurate generation of separated
representation requires a number of state samples that is linear in the
dimension of input uncertainties. The computation cost of a separated
representation scales linearly with respect to the sample count, thereby
improving tractability when compared to methods that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In addition to detailed discussions on their construction and
use in sensitivity analysis, this paper presents results for three test cases
of an Earth orbiting satellite. The first two cases demonstrate that
approximation via separated representations produces a tractable solution for
propagating the Cartesian orbit-state uncertainty with up to 20 uncertain
inputs. The third case, which instead uses Equinoctial elements, reexamines a
scenario presented in the literature and employs the proposed method for
sensitivity analysis to more thoroughly characterize the relative effects of
uncertain inputs on the propagated state.

gradient flow has been proved to be useful in practical computations of
homology groups, it is not sufficient to recover the homotopy type of $X$.
Forman also proved the existence of a CW complex which is homotopy equivalent
to $X$ and whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with the critical cells

description. By relaxing the definition of Forman's gradient flows, we
introduce the notion of flow paths, which contains enough information to
reconstruct the homotopy type of $X$, while retaining a combinatorial
description. The critical difference from Forman's gradient flows is the
existence of a partial order on the set of flow paths, from which a
$2$-category $C(\mu)$ is constructed. It is shown that the classifying space of
$C(\mu)$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$ by using homotopy theory of
$2$-categories. This result can be also regarded as a discrete analogue of the

interplay between spin and motional degrees of freedom. For example, doping an
antiferromagnet gives rise to interesting phases including pseudogap states and
high-temperature superconductors. A promising route towards achieving a
complete understanding of these materials begins with analytic and
computational analysis of simplified models. Quantum simulation has recently
emerged as a complementary approach towards understanding these models.
Ultracold fermions in optical lattices offer the potential to answer open
questions on the low-temperature regime of the doped Hubbard model, which is
thought to capture essential aspects of the cuprate superconductor phase
diagram but is numerically intractable in that parameter regime. A new
perspective is afforded by quantum gas microscopy of fermions, which allows
readout of magnetic correlations at the site-resolved level. Here we report the
realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a
2D square lattice of approximately 80 sites. Using site-resolved imaging, we
detect (finite-size) antiferromagnetic long-range order (LRO) through the
development of a peak in the spin structure factor and the divergence of the
correlation length that reaches the size of the system. At our lowest
temperature of T/t = 0.25(2) we find strong order across the entire sample. Our
experimental platform enables doping away from half filling, where pseudogap
states and stripe ordering are expected, but theoretical methods become
numerically intractable. In this regime we find that the antiferromagnetic LRO
persists to hole dopings of about 15%, providing a guideline for computational
methods. Our results demonstrate that quantum gas microscopy of ultracold
fermions in optical lattices can now address open questions on the
low-temperature Hubbard model.

By examining the first large-scale, systematically tracked credibility database

events over a span of three months), we established a relationship between the
temporal dynamics of events reported on social media and their associated level

temporal signatures of an event reportage, we found that the amount of
continued attention focused on an event provides information about its
associated levels of perceived credibility. Events exhibiting sustained,
intermittent bursts of attention were found to be associated with lower levels
of perceived credibility. In other words, as more people showed interest during
moments of transient collective attention, the associated uncertainty
surrounding these events also increased.

generation mobile networks. This paper provides an analysis of a well-known
model for resource sharing, the 'share-constrained proportional allocation'

the performance benefits of sharing, while retaining the ability to customize
their own users' allocation. This results in a network slicing game in which
each tenant reacts to the user allocations of the other tenants so as to
maximize its own utility. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the game
associated with such strategic behavior converges to a Nash equilibrium. At the
Nash equilibrium, a tenant always achieves the same, or better, performance
than under a static partitioning of resources, hence providing the same level
of protection as such static partitioning. We further analyze the efficiency
and fairness of the resulting allocations, providing tight bounds for the price
of anarchy and envy-freeness. Our analysis and extensive simulation results
confirm that the mechanism provides a comprehensive practical solution to
realize network slicing. Our theoretical results also fill a gap in the
literature regarding the analysis of this resource allocation model under

flapping propulsion by a flexible wing in a nearly inviscid fluid. We allow the
wing's elastic modulus and mass density to vary arbitrarily, with an eye
towards optimizing these distributions for propulsive performance. The method
to determine the wing kinematics is based on Chebyshev collocation of the 1D
beam equation as coupled to the surrounding 2D fluid flow. Through
small-amplitude analysis of the Euler equations (with trailing-edge vortex
shedding), the complete hydrodynamics can be represented by a nonlocal operator
that acts on the 1D wing kinematics. A class of semi-analytical solutions
permits fast evaluation of this operator with $O(N \log N)$ operations, where
$N$ is the number of collocation points on the wing. This is in contrast to the
minimum $O(N^2)$ operations required by a direct 2D fluid solver. The coupled
wing-fluid problem is thus recast as a PDE with nonlocal operator, which we
solve using a preconditioned iterative method. These techniques yield a solver
of near-optimal complexity, $O(N \log N)$, allowing one to rapidly search the
infinite-dimensional parameter space of all possible material distributions and
even perform optimization over this space.

to infer the stellar structure. For evolved stars, we benefit from unique
information directly carried out by mixed modes that probe their radiative
cores. This third article of the series devoted to mixed modes in red giants
focuses on their coupling factors that remained largely unexploited up to now.
  With the measurement of the coupling factors, we intend to give physical
constraints on the regions surrounding the radiative core and the
hydrogen-burning shell of subgiants and red giants. A new method for measuring
the coupling factor of mixed modes is set up. It is derived from the method
recently implemented for measuring period spacings. It runs in an automated way
so that it can be applied to a large sample of stars.
  Coupling factors of mixed modes were measured for thousands of red giants.
They show specific variation with mass and evolutionary stage. Weak coupling is
observed for the most evolved stars on the red giant branch only; large
coupling factors are measured at the transition between subgiants and red
giants, as well as in the red clump.
  The measurement of coupling factors in dipole mixed modes provides a new
insight into the inner interior structure of evolved stars. While the large
frequency separation and the asymptotic period spacings probe the envelope and
the core, respectively, the coupling factor is directly sensitive to the
intermediate region in between and helps determining its extent.
Observationally, the determination of the coupling factor is a prior to precise
fits of the mixed-mode pattern, and can now be used to address further
properties of the mixed-mode pattern, as the signature of the buoyancy glitches
and the core rotation.

differs from pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) that use wholly
deterministic algorithms and from true random number generators (TRNG) in which
the randomness source is a physical system. For each class, we analyze the
thermodynamics of generators based on algorithms implemented as finite-state

This establishes bounds on heat dissipation and work consumption during the
operation of three main classes of RNG algorithms---including those of von
Neumann, Knuth and Yao, and Roche and Hoshi---and for PRNG methods. We
introduce a general TRNG and determine its thermodynamic costs exactly for
arbitrary target distributions. The results highlight the significant
differences between the three main approaches to random number generation: One
is work producing, one is work consuming, and the other is potentially
dissipation neutral. Notably, TRNGs can both generate random numbers and
convert thermal energy to stored work. These thermodynamic costs on information
creation complement Landauer's limit on the irreducible costs of information
destruction.

suited for various large-scale learning tasks. When block-separable constraints
are present, randomized block FW (RB-FW) has been shown to further reduce
complexity by updating only a fraction of coordinate blocks per iteration. To
circumvent the limitations of existing methods, the present work develops step
sizes for RB-FW that enable a flexible selection of the number of blocks to
update per iteration while ensuring convergence and feasibility of the
iterates. To this end, convergence rates of RB-FW are established through
computational bounds on a primal sub-optimality measure and on the duality gap.
The novel bounds extend the existing convergence analysis, which only applies
to a step-size sequence that does not generally lead to feasible iterates.
Furthermore, two classes of step-size sequences that guarantee feasibility of
the iterates are also proposed to enhance flexibility in choosing decay rates.
The novel convergence results are markedly broadened to encompass also
nonconvex objectives, and further assert that RB-FW with exact line-search
reaches a stationary point at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$. Performance of
RB-FW with different step sizes and number of blocks is demonstrated in two
applications, namely charging of electrical vehicles and structural support
vector machines. Extensive simulated tests demonstrate the performance
improvement of RB-FW relative to existing randomized single-block FW methods.

average value of a set of numbers possessed by the agents in a distributed
network using only communication between neighboring agents. Gossiping is a
well-known approach to the problem which seeks to iteratively arrive at a
solution by allowing each agent to interchange information with at most one
neighbor at each iterative step. Crafting a gossiping protocol which
accomplishes this is challenging because gossiping is an inherently
collaborative process which can lead to deadlocks unless careful precautions
are taken to ensure that it does not. Many gossiping protocols are
request-based which means simply that a gossip between two agents will occur
whenever one of the two agents accepts a request to gossip placed by the other.
In this paper, we present three deterministic request-based protocols. We show
by example that the first can deadlock. The second is guaranteed to avoid
deadlocks and requires fewer transmissions per iteration than standard
broadcast-based distributed averaging protocols by exploiting the idea of local
ordering together with the notion of an agent's neighbor queue; the protocol
requires the simplest queue updates, which provides an in-depth understanding
of how local ordering and queue updates avoid deadlocks. It is shown that a
third protocol which uses a slightly more complicated queue update rule can
lead to significantly faster convergence; a worst case bound on convergence
rate is provided.

computing infinite sums of SL(2,R) conformal blocks. Using these techniques, we
solve the lightcone bootstrap to all orders in an asymptotic expansion in large
spin, and suggest a strategy for going beyond the large spin limit. We carry
out the first steps of this strategy for the 3d Ising CFT, deriving analytic
approximations for the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several infinite

The analytic results agree with numerics to high precision for about 100

large-spin families). Plugging these results back into the crossing equations,
we obtain approximate analytic constraints on the initial data.

The problem of detecting an attack on the system and jointly estimating its

solved in the Bayesian framework for systems with and without direct
feedthrough of the attack input to the output. This leads to the analytical
derivation of a hybrid Bernoulli filter (HBF) that updates in real-time the
joint posterior density of a Bernoulli attack RFS and of the state vector. A

the effectiveness of the developed tools for joint attack detection and secure

demonstrates the very large anisotropy in the LTC of the \beta phase. It is
found that the large anisotropy in the LTC of \beta-Si$_3$N$_4$ was caused by
the elongated Brillouin zone along the c* axis, where the acoustic phonons
mostly contribute to LTC and have large group velocities even near the
Brillouin zone boundary. The LTC of \gamma-Si$_3$N$_4$ is 81, which is as small
as that of \alpha-Si$_3$N$_4$, although \gamma-Si$_3$N$_4$ has much larger

efficiency of prices on stock exchanges to aggregate information). Assets are
traded in either an exchange or a dark pool, with the dark pool offering better
prices but lower execution rates. Informed traders receive noisy and
heterogeneous signals about an asset's fundamental. We find that informed
traders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a
sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges,
traders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak
signals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on
price discovery. That is, when information precision is high (information risk
is low), the majority of informed traders trade in the exchange hence adding a
dark pool enhances price discovery, whereas when information precision is low
(information risk is high), the majority of the informed traders trade in the
dark pool hence adding a dark pool impairs price discovery. The paper
reconciles the conflicting empirical evidence and produces novel empirical
predictions. The paper also provides regulatory suggestions with dark pools on

Competing realized measures (e.g. Realized Variance and Realized Range) are
employed as the dependent variable in the measurement equation and to drive
expectile dynamics. The measurement equation here models the contemporaneous
dependence between the realized measure and the latent conditional expectile.
We also propose employing the quantile loss function as the target criterion,
instead of the conventional violation rate, during the expectile level grid
search. For the proposed model, the usual search procedure and asymmetric least
squares (ALS) optimization to estimate the expectile level and CARE parameters
proves challenging and often fails to convergence. We incorporate a fast random
walk Metropolis stochastic search method, combined with a more targeted grid
search procedure, to allow reasonably fast and improved accuracy in estimation
of this level and the associated model parameters. Given the convergence issue,
Bayesian adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are proposed for estimation,
whilst their properties are assessed and compared with ALS via a simulation

disfavoured models (such as LambdaCDM) predicting a variable acceleration,

stability, a situation in which uniform traffic flow at any spacing is linearly
stable. Near the threshold of absolute stability, these models can often be
reduced to a modified Korteweg-deVries (mKdV) equation plus small corrections.
The hyperbolic-tangent ""kink"" solutions of the mKdV equation are usually of
particular interest, as they represent transition zones between regions of
different traffic spacings. Solvability analysis then shows that only a single
member of the one-parameter family of kink solutions is preserved by the
correction terms, and this is interpreted as a kind of selection. We point out
that one cannot extend the solvability analysis to a multiple-time-scales
calculation, so that the solvability analysis does not point the way to any
dynamical mechanism by which the ""selected"" kink might actually be selected. On
the other hand, we display a two-parameter family of traveling wave solutions
of the mKdV equation which describe regions of one traffic spacing embedded in
traffic of a different spacing; this family includes the kink solutions as a
limiting case. We carry out the multiple-time-scales calculation and find
conditions under which the inclusions decay, conditions that lead to a selected
inclusion, and conditions for which the inclusion evolves into a pair of kinks.
Finally, we show that the usual ""solvability"" calculation for kink solutions
does not in fact identify a selected kink, but -- for all kink solutions --
merely gives a first-order correction to the relation between the traffic
spacings far behind and far ahead of the kink.

the general strategy. We complement the introduced results with a fairly large
collection of numerical experiments that are in an overwhelming agreement with
what the theory predicts. We also show how many well known comparison results
(e.g. Slepian's max and Gordon's minmax principle) can be obtained as special

single max principle as well. The range of applications is enormous. It starts
with revisiting many of the results we created in recent years in various
mathematical fields and recognizing that they are fully self-contained as their
starting blocks are specialized variants of the concepts introduced here.
Further upgrades relate to core comparison extensions on the one side and more

unlikely X-ray binaries based upon their spatial distribution and luminosity

early-type spirals, but drops to roughly 20% for Sc and later types, consistent

powerful in finding weak AGNs, especially from regions with active star
formation that may mask the optical AGN signature. For example, 31% of the H II
nuclei are found to harbor an X-ray AGN. For most objects, a single power-law
model subject to interstellar absorption is adequate to fit the spectrum, and
the typical photon index is found to be around 1.8. For galaxies with a

mediated by the electron-phonon interaction. The decrease of the Debye
frequency increases the relative strength of the Coulomb interaction, which
results in a positive isotope shift of $T_{\rm c}$ when the mass $M$ of an atom
increases. Following this picture, we evaluate the isotope effect of $T_{\rm
c}$ by using the Stoner theory and a spin-fluctuation theory. When $T_{\rm c}$
is large enough as large as or more than 100K, the isotope effect on $T_{\rm
c}$ can be measurable. Recently, precise measurements on the oxygen isotope
effect on $T_{\rm c}$ have been performed for itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO$_3$
with $T_{\rm c}\sim 160$K. A clear isotope effect has been observed with the
positive shift of $T_{\rm c}\sim 1$K by isotope substitution
($^{16}O\rightarrow ^{18}O$). This experimental result is consistent with our

  Systems",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Controller synthesis techniques for continuous systems with respect to
temporal logic specifications typically use a finite-state symbolic abstraction
of the system model. Constructing this abstraction for the entire system is
computationally expensive, and does not exploit natural decompositions of many
systems into interacting components. We describe a methodology for
compositional symbolic abstraction to help scale controller synthesis for
temporal logic to larger systems.
  We introduce a new relation, called (approximate) disturbance bisimulation,
as the basis for compositional symbolic abstractions. Disturbance bisimulation
strengthens the standard approximate alternating bisimulation relation used in
control. It extends naturally to systems which are composed of weakly
interconnected sub-components possibly connected in feedback, and models the
coupling signals as disturbances. After proving this composability of
disturbance bisimulation for metric systems we apply this result to the
compositional abstraction of networks of input-to-state stable deterministic
non-linear control systems. We give conditions that allow to construct
finite-state abstractions compositionally for each component in such a network,
so that the abstractions are simultaneously disturbance bisimilar to their
continuous counterparts. Combining these two results, we show conditions under
which one can compositionally abstract a network of non-linear control systems
in a modular way while ensuring that the final composed abstraction is
disturbance bisimilar to the original system. We discuss how we get a
compositional abstraction-based controller synthesis methodology for networks
of such systems against local temporal specifications as a by-product of our
construction.

exponentially or all geometrically distributed. The parameter of the

in the geometric case, where $(a_i)_{i \ge 1}$ and $(b_j)_{j \ge 1}$ are
themselves drawn randomly at the outset from ergodic distributions. These
models are inhomogeneous generalizations of the much studied exactly solvable
models in which the parameters are the same for all sites. Our motivation is to
understand how inhomogeneity influences the limit shape and the corresponding
limit fluctuations. We obtain a simple variational formula for the shape
function and prove that it is strictly concave inside a cone (possibly the
entire quadrant) but is linear outside. This is in contrast with the situation
in the models with i.i.d. weights in which the shape function is expected to be
strictly concave under mild assumptions. For the directions inside the cone, we
show that the limit fluctuations are governed by the Tracy-Widom GUE
distribution and derive bounds for the deviations of the last-passage times
above the shape function. To obtain the shape result, we couple the model with
an explicit family of stationary versions of it. For the fluctuation and large
deviation results, we perform steepest-descent analysis on an available
Fredholm determinant formula for the one-point distribution of the last-passage
time. We also develop a detailed appendix on the steepest-descent curves of

metallic nanostructures. Therefore, they are considered to provide a promising
scheme to generate extreme-ultraviolet harmonics, using low power drivings.
During high-order harmonic generation (HHG), the driving and harmonic fields
accumulate a phase difference as they propagate through the target. In a
typical set-up -a laser focused into a gas jet or cell- the propagation
distances amount to several wavelengths, and the cumulative phase-mismatch
affects strongly the efficiency and properties of the harmonic emission. In
contrast, HHG in metallic nanostructures is considered to overcome this
limitations, as the common sources of phase mismatch -optical density and
focusing geometry- are negligible for subwavelength propagation distances.
Nevertheless, in this letter we demonstrate that phase matching still plays a
relevant role in HHG from nanostructures. Our computations attribute this to
the non-perturbative character of HHG, that links the phase of the harmonics to
the intensity distribution of the driving field. We also show that widely used
applications of phase matching control, such as quantum path selection and the
increase of contrast in attosecond pulse generation, are also feasible at the

sequentially to output a latent representation, and occlusion-robustness is
achieved owing to the fact that the influence of occlusion is only upon some of
the patches. Receiving the representation learned by the encoder, the LSTM
decoder with a dual channel architecture reconstructs the overall face and
detects occlusion simultaneously, and by feat of LSTM, the decoder breaks down
the task of face de-occlusion into restoring the occluded part step by step.
Moreover, to minimize identify information loss and guarantee face recognition
accuracy over recovered faces, we introduce an identity-preserving adversarial
training scheme to further improve RLA. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real datasets of faces with occlusion clearly demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed RLA in removing different types of facial occlusion at various
locations. The proposed method also provides significantly larger performance
gain than other de-occlusion methods in promoting recognition performance over
partially-occluded faces.

the structure function analysis which describes the amount of variability as a
function of the lag between the observations.Our work shows an increase of the
structure function up to 20 years. We do not find evidence of a plateau in the

the known methods either have computational costs that scale inefficiently with
the number of particles or require more information on the state than what is
attainable in everyday experiments. We introduce a new technique for
entanglement detection that provides several important advantages in these
respects. First, it scales efficiently with the number of particles, thus
allowing for application to systems composed by up to few tens of particles.
Second, it needs only the knowledge of a subset of all possible measurements on
the state, therefore being apt for experimental implementation. Moreover, since
it is based on the detection of nonlocality, our method is device independent.

method. As a result, we found a phase transition detectable only by the
divergence of fidelity susceptibility. The exponentially small gapless points
of each instance are all located in the phase found in this study, which
suggests that this phase transition is the physical cause of the failure of QA
for NP-hard problems.

studied for decades. They are typically based on a series of pairwise
comparisons and run entirely on chip. However people routinely sort lists which
depend on subjective or complex judgements that cannot be automated. Examples
include marketing research; where surveys are used to learn about customer
preferences for products, the recruiting process; where interviewers attempt to
rank potential employees, and sporting tournaments; where we infer team
rankings from a series of one on one matches. We develop a novel sorting
algorithm, where each pairwise comparison reflects a subjective human judgement
about which element is bigger or better. We introduce a finite and large error
rate to each judgement, and we take the cost of each comparison to
significantly exceed the cost of other computational steps. The algorithm must
request the most informative sequence of comparisons from the user; in order to
identify the correct sorted list with minimum human input. Our Discrete
Adiabatic Monte Carlo approach exploits the gradual acquisition of information
by tracking a set of plausible hypotheses which are updated after each
additional comparison.

$F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ with a non background scalar field has been considered
for the breaking of conformal invariance. We have shown that non singular
bouncing cosmology supports magnetogenesis evading the long standing back
reaction and strong coupling problems which have plagued inflationary
magnetogenesis. In this model, we have achieved a scale invariant power
spectrum for the parameter range compatible with observed CMB anisotropies. The
desired strength of the magnetic field has also been obtained that goes in
accordance with present observations. It is also important to note that no BKL
instability arises within this parameter range. The energy scales for different
stages of evolution of the bouncing model are so chosen that they solve the
problems of Standard Big Bang cosmology as well.

magnetic field lines. This scenario can reasonably account for the unusual
behavior of the wave front over the coronal cavity.

Specifically, they have been used extensively to investigate the thermal

particular, I discuss as to how the response of detectors does not necessarily
reflect the particle content of the quantum field. I also describe an
interesting `inversion of statistics' that occurs in odd spacetime dimensions
for `odd couplings', i.e. the response of a uniformly accelerating detector is
characterized by a Fermi-Dirac distribution even when it is interacting with a
scalar field. Moreover, by coupling the detector to a quantum field that is
governed by a modified dispersion relation arising supposedly due to quantum
gravitational effects, I examine the possible Planck scale modifications to the
response of a rotating detector in flat spacetime. Lastly, I discuss as to why
detectors that are switched on for a finite period of time need to be turned on
smoothly in order to have a meaningful response.

to work out non-Bayesian extensions of EUT which cope with its paradoxes and
incorporate attitudes toward ambiguity. A variant of the Ellsberg paradox,
recently proposed by Mark Machina and confirmed experimentally, challenges
existing non-Bayesian models of decision-making under uncertainty. Relying on a
decade of research which has successfully applied the formalism of quantum
theory to model cognitive entities and fallacies of human reasoning, we put
forward a non-Bayesian extension of EUT in which subjective probabilities are
represented by quantum probabilities, while the preference relation between
acts depends on the state of the situation that is the object of the decision.
We show that the benefits of using the quantum theoretical framework enables
the modeling of the Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes, as the representation of
ambiguity and behavioral attitudes toward it. The theoretical framework
presented here is a first step toward the development of a `state-dependent
non-Bayesian extension of EUT' and it has potential applications in economic

in contrast to fully flexible chains, for semi-flexible polymers with a finite
persistence length $\tilde{\ell}_p$ the {\it trans} side friction must be
explicitly taken into account to properly describe the translocation process.
In addition, the scaling of the end-to-end distance $R_N$ as a function of the
chain length $N$ must be known. To this end, we first derive a semi-analytic
scaling form for $R_N$, which reproduces the limits of a rod, an ideal chain,
and an excluded volume chain in the appropriate limits. We then quantitatively
characterize the nature of the {\it trans} side friction based on MD
simulations of semi-flexible chains. Augmented with these two factors, the
modified IFTP theory shows that there are three main regimes for the scaling of
the average translocation time $\tau \propto N^{\alpha}$. In the stiff chain
(rod) limit $N/\tilde{\ell}_p \ll 1$, {$\alpha = 2$}, which continuously
crosses over in the regime $ 1 < N/\tilde{\ell}_p < 4$ towards the ideal chain
behavior with {$\alpha = 3/2$}, which is reached in the regime
$N/\tilde{\ell}_p \sim 10^2$. Finally, in the limit $N/\tilde{\ell}_p \gg 10^6$
the translocation exponent approaches its symptotic value $1+\nu$, where $\nu$

motivating factors for using strong authentication mechanisms, convincing users

considered mandatory. A user who leaves a logged-in workstation unattended
(especially for a short time) is typically not inconvenienced in any way; in
fact, the other way around: no annoying reauthentication is needed upon return.
However, an unattended workstation is trivially susceptible to the well-known
""lunchtime attack"" by any nearby adversary who simply takes over the departed
user's log-in session. At the same time, since deathentication does not
intrinsically require user secrets, it can, in principle, be made unobtrusive.
To this end, this paper designs the first automatic user deauthentication
system, FADEWICH, that does not rely on biometric- or behavior-based techniques
(e.g., keystroke dynamics) and does not require users to carry any devices. It
uses physical properties of wireless signals and the effect of human bodies on
their propagation. To assess FADEWICH's feasibility and performance, extensive
experiments were conducted with its prototype. Results show that it suffices to
have nine inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a shared office setting to
correctly deauthenticate all users within six seconds (90% within four seconds)
after they leave their workstation's vicinity. We considered two realistic
scenarios where the adversary attempts to subvert FADEWICH and showed that

tidal interactions with halo assembly times. The trend with geometric
environment is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger

downsizing - more massive haloes host galaxies that assembled their stars
earlier. This overall trend holds independently of geometric environment. We
support our analysis with an in-depth exploration of the L-Galaxies

three different definitions of halo formation time. We find a complex
relationship between halo formation time and galaxy properties, with
significant scatter. We confirm that stellar mass to halo mass ratio, specific

rate is a poor indicator at all halo masses. Using the same semi-analytic

rigidity at low weight. Such structures are omnipresent in natural biomaterials

composites to paper and textiles. Here, we demonstrate that fibrous networks of
the blood clotting protein fibrin undergo a strong and irreversible increase in
their mechanical rigidity in response to compression. This rigidification can
be precisely predetermined from the level of applied compressive strain,
providing a means to program the network rigidity without having to change its
composition. To identify the mechanism underlying this programmable
rigidification, we measure single fiber-fiber interactions using optical
tweezers. We further develop a minimal computational model of adhesive fiber
networks that shows that load-induced bond formation can explain the adaptation
of the fibrin networks to compressive loading. The model predicts that the
network stiffness after compressive programming obeys a universal power-law
dependence on the prestress built in by new bond formation, which we confirm
experimentally. The generality of this functional stiffening mechanism together
with our ability to quantitatively predict it provides a new powerful approach
to program the stiffness of fibrous materials and dynamically adapt them to

approximate because of the scale of data involved and the stochastic nature of

processing paradigms such as map-reduce. However, data parallel processing
primitives such as repeated barrier and reduce operations introduce high
synchronization overheads. Hence, many existing data-processing platforms use
asynchrony and staleness to improve data-parallel job performance. Often, these
systems simply change the synchronous communication to asynchronous between the

but results in poor accuracy of the final output since different workers may
progress at different speeds and process inconsistent intermediate outputs.
  In this paper, we present ASAP, a model that provides asynchronous and

fine-grained worker synchronization using NOTIFY-ACK semantics that allows
independent workers to run asynchronously. ASAP also provides stochastic reduce
that provides approximate but guaranteed convergence to the same result as an

acceptability criteria. We hypothesised that a model-based approach to

enable more efficient use of these tests. We therefore developed a novel
statistical model for infant MBW data and applied it to 1,197 tests from 432

the lung clearance index (LCI), the most commonly used summary of lung function

empirical approach. Furthermore, the modelling approach enables LCI to be
estimated using tests with different degrees of completeness, something not
possible with the standard approach. Our model therefore allows previously
unused data to be used rather than discarded, as well as routine use of shorter
tests without significant loss of precision. Beyond our specific application,
our work illustrates a number of important aspects of Bayesian modelling in

repeated measurements and the value of model checking via posterior predictive

this scenario the Standard Model (SM) is extended by a fermion, a scalar and an

${\rm U(1)}_{\rm DM}$ and interacts with the pseudo scalar via Yukawa
interaction while a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed on the other component
-- the scalar. These ensure the stability of both the dark matter components.
Although the Lagrangian of the present model is CP conserving, however the CP
symmetry breaks spontaneously when the pseudo scalar acquires a vacuum
expectation value (VEV). The scalar component of the dark matter in the present
model also develops a VEV on spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. Thus the various interactions of the dark sector and the SM sector
are progressed through the mixing of the SM like Higgs boson, the pseudo scalar
Higgs like boson and the singlet scalar boson. We show that the observed gamma
ray excess from the Galactic Centre, self-interaction of dark matter from
colliding clusters as well as the 3.55 keV X-ray line from Perseus, Andromeda

questions of simulability of long-time dynamics in one spatial dimension.
  It is argued that: (i) thermal density matrices $\rho \propto e^{-\beta H}$
and Generalized Gibbs Ensemble density matrices $\rho \propto e^{- H_{\rm
GGE}}$ with local $H_{\rm GGE}$ generically obey the operator area law; (ii)
after a global quench, the OSEE first grows linearly with time, then decreases
back to its thermal or GGE saturation value, implying that, while the operator
area law is satisfied both in the initial state and in the asymptotic
stationary state at large time, it is strongly violated in the transient
regime; (iii) the OSEE of the evolution operator $U(t) = e^{-i H t}$ increases
linearly with $t$, unless the Hamiltonian is in a localized phase; (iv) local
operators in Heisenberg picture, $\phi(t) = e^{i H t} \phi e^{-i H t}$, have an
OSEE that grows sublinearly in time (perhaps logarithmically), however it is
unclear whether this effect can be captured in a traditional CFT framework, as
the free fermion case hints at an unexpected breakdown of conformal invariance.

classifier by maximizing the AUC performance. The AUC performance of nonlinear
classifiers, designed using online methods, is not comparable with that of
nonlinear classifiers designed using batch learning algorithms on many
real-world datasets. Motivated by these observations, we design a scalable
algorithm for maximizing AUC performance by greedily adding the required number
of basis functions into the classifier model. The resulting sparse classifiers
perform faster inference. Our experimental results show that the level of
sparsity achievable can be order of magnitude smaller than the Kernel RankSVM
model without affecting the AUC performance much.

disks. Important parameters to model their collisional evolution and to compute
the dust production rate are the intrinsic probability of collision $P_i$ and
the mean impact velocity $U_c$. If a planet orbits close to the belt, the
values of both these parameters are affected by its secular perturbations
yielding a strong correlation between eccentricity $e$ and pericentre longitude
$\varpi$. We adopt a new algorithm to compute both $P_i$ and $U_c$ in presence
of various levels of secular correlation due to different ratios between proper
and forced eccentricity. We tested this algorithm in a standard case with a
Jupiter--sized planet orbiting inside a putative planetesimal belt finding that
it is less collisionally active compared to a self--stirred belt because of the
$e - \varpi$ coupling. The eccentricity of the planet is an important parameter
in determining the amount of dust production since the erosion rate is 10 times
faster when the planet eccentricity increases from 0.1 to 0.6. Also the initial
conditions of the belt (either warm or cold) and its average inclination
strongly affects $P_i$ and $U_c$ and then its long term collisional evolution
in presence of the planet. We finally apply our method to the planetesimal
belts supposedly refilling the dust disks around HD 38529 and $\epsilon$
Eridani. In the most collisionally active configurations, only a small fraction
of bodies smaller than 100 km are expected to be fragmented over a time--span
of 4 Gyr.

Schwinger model, a U(1)-Wilson lattice gauge theory describing the interplay
between fermionic matter and gauge bosons. Here, we provide a detailed
theoretical analysis of the performance and the potential of this protocol. Our
strategy is based on analytically integrating out the gauge bosons, which
preserves exact gauge invariance but results in complicated long-range
interactions between the matter fields. Trapped-ion platforms are naturally
suited to implementing these interactions, allowing for an efficient quantum
simulation of the model, with a number of gate operations that scales only
polynomially with system size. Employing numerical simulations, we illustrate
that relevant phenomena can be observed in larger experimental systems, using
as an example the production of particle--antiparticle pairs after a quantum
quench. We investigate theoretically the robustness of the scheme towards
generic error sources, and show that near-future experiments can reach regimes
where finite-size effects are insignificant. We also discuss the challenges in
quantum simulating the continuum limit of the theory. Using our scheme,
fundamental phenomena of lattice gauge theories can be probed using a broad set
of experimentally accessible observables, including the entanglement entropy

tracers motivated particularly by the insightful proposal of Hodgkin and Keynes
on a relation between flux ratios and channel structure. Our study is based on
analysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic
flows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson
equation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and
is in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all
physical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions
and channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in
flux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk
conditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that
are specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.
Universal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux
ratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two
treatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important
properties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main
ion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests
a better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the
main ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns
ratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties
of channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of
estimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the
spatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and
thus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,
even with ideal ionic solutions. ...

developed, which allows describing certain class of micro- and macrosystems.
$\Psi$ - model is based on continuum and quantum mechanics. $\Psi$ - model
describes micro- and macrosystems, in which vector field of velocities of
probability flows, charge, mass has specific spiral structure. The field of
velocities has spiral structure on concentric spherical surfaces. The velocity
field is not defined and has a characteristic property on the poles of sphere
and on the axis and tends to zero at infinity. The behavior of $\Psi$ - model
can be described in the general case with unsteady periodic singular solution
of the Schr\""odinger equation. The application of $\Psi$ - model to the
description of elementary particles gives naturally the intrinsic magnetic
moment (spin) without need in modification of g-factor. The spin is interpreted
as rotation in the framework of the relativity theory. The application of
$\Psi$ -model to astrophysics gives formally an interpretation of black and
white hole, wormhole, structure of the galaxy, anti-galaxy and

multiple input multiple output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) system
employing link adaptation of spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity.
Real-time MIMO signal processing is implemented by using the Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) based Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices.
Software defined implantation of MIMO VLC can assist in enabling an adaptive
and reconfigurable communication system without hardware changes. We measured
the error vector magnitude (EVM), bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency
performance for single carrier M-QAM MIMO VLC using spatial diversity and
spatial multiplexing. Results show that spatial diversity MIMO VLC improves
error performance at the cost of spectral efficiency that spatial multiplexing
should enhance. We propose the adaptive MIMO solution that both modulation
schema and MIMO schema are dynamically adapted to the changing channel
conditions for enhancing the error performance and spectral efficiency. The
average error-free spectral efficiency of adaptive 2x2 MIMO VLC achieved 12

sphere, the Pre cloak relative parameter is not less than 1; the parameters and
their derivative are continuous across the boundary r=R2 and the parameters are
going to infinity at origin r=0. The phase velocity of EM wave in the sphere is
less than light speed and going to zero at origin. The EM wave field excited in
the outside of the sphere can not be disturbed by GLHUA sphere. By GL full wave
method, we rigorously proved the incident EM wave field excited in outside of
GLHUA sphere and propagation through the sphere without any scattering by the
sphere, the total EM field in outside of the sphere equal to the incident wave

with barotropic equation of state while a real scalar field with self
interacting potential is chosen as dark energy. The scalar field potential is
chosen as exponential or hyperbolic in nature and three different choices for
the interaction between the dark species are considered. In the background of
spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)

suitable transformation of variables and a series of critical points are
obtained for different interactions. By analyzing the critical points, we have

This property is
very important and convenient in the context of the fight against poverty.
Indeed, it makes it possible to put in place sectoral poverty reduction
policies on the basis of a relevant stratification laid down at the outset. The
simultaneous impacts of these policies, measured as reduction gains over the
population as a whole, is then obtained by aggregating those obtained at each
stratum by a relatively simple formula. It turns out that indicators as
important as those of Sen and Shorrocks do not verify this property contrary to
the elements of the class of Foster - Greer and Thorbecke. Given the data from
the 1996 Senegalese Survey of Households (ESAM), we show that the lack of
decomposability of these indicators on the income variable for several types of
population stratification is practically zero , of the order of one to two per
thousand. This makes it possible to use the decomposition of the Sen and
Shorrocks indicators without any untoward consequences. An explanatory model of
these results is presented for future research.

degradation in synaptic transmission, is a matter of debate in the literature.
In fact, electrophysiological signals are commonly characterized as inversely
proportional to stimulus intensity. Among theoretical descriptions of this
phenomenon, models based on $1/f$-dependency are employed to investigate the
biophysical properties of the short term synaptic depression. In this work we
formulated a model based on a paradigmatic \textit{q}-differential equation to
obtain a generalized formalism useful for investigation of nonextensivity in
this specific type of synaptic plasticity. Our analysis reveals nonextensivity
in data from electrophysiological recordings and also a statistical crossover
in neurotransmission. In particular, statistical transitions providesadditional
support to the hypothesis of heterogeneous release probability of
neurotransmitters. On the other hand, the simple vesicle model agrees with data
only at low frequency stimulations. Thus, the present work presents a method to
demonstrate that short-term depression is not only governed by random
mechanisms but also by a nonextensive behavior. Our findings also conciliate
morphological and electrophysiological investigations into a coherent
biophysical scenario.

  Truth and Correctness",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research in information systems includes a wide range of approaches which
make a contribution in terms of knowledge, understanding, or practical
developments. The measure of any research is, ultimately, its validity: are its
finding true, or its recommendations correct? However, empirical studies show
that discussion of validity in research is often weak. In this paper we examine
the nature of truth and correctness in order to construct a validation
framework that can encompass all the varied forms of research. Within
philosophy, there has been much debate about truth, is it correspondence,
coherence, consensual or pragmatic, and in fact current views revolve around
the idea of a pluralist view of truth: it is one and many. Related to truth is
the concept of correctness, and in particular the necessity of both internal
correctness and external correctness. The framework we develop based on these
concepts of truth and correctness has been applied to a range of research forms
including positivist, mathematical, interpretive, design science, critical and
action oriented. The benefits are: i) that a greater and more explicit focus on
validity criteria will produce better research; ii) having a single framework
can unite what at times seem conflicting approaches to research; iii) having
criteria made explicit should encourage debate and further development.
