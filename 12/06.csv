Hero III, Alexandru Mara, and Saeed Jahromi","Semi-Supervised Learning via Sparse Label Propagation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a novel method for semi-supervised learning from partially
labeled massive network-structured datasets, i.e., big data over networks. We
model the underlying hypothesis, which relates data points to labels, as a
graph signal, defined over some graph (network) structure intrinsic to the
dataset. Following the key principle of supervised learning, i.e., similar
inputs yield similar outputs, we require the graph signals induced by labels to
have small total variation. Accordingly, we formulate the problem of learning
the labels of data points as a non-smooth convex optimization problem which
amounts to balancing between the empirical loss, i.e., the discrepancy with
some partially available label information, and the smoothness quantified by
the total variation of the learned graph signal. We solve this optimization
problem by appealing to a recently proposed preconditioned variant of the
popular primal-dual method by Pock and Chambolle, which results in a sparse
label propagation algorithm. This learning algorithm allows for a highly
scalable implementation as message passing over the underlying data graph. By
applying concepts of compressed sensing to the learning problem, we are also
able to provide a transparent sufficient condition on the underlying network
structure such that accurate learning of the labels is possible. We also
present an implementation of the message passing formulation allows for a
highly scalable implementation in big data frameworks.

simultaneously allocate spectrum resources to users in an energy efficient
manner and switch off redundant small cell BSs. The high complexity dual

performances are compared to those of the optimal technique. The particularly
interesting case of semi-closed FAPs, in which the FAPs accept to serve
external users, achieves the highest energy efficiency due to increased degrees

Recommender systems automatically suggest items to users that might be
interesting for them. Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust
in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating
prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by
users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust
scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust
Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their
interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be
extracted from users' ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between
users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted
trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social
relation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both:
trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit
social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same
performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users.
Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the
state-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the
extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the
prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The
experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix
factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better
than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction.

Tevatron and $Z^\prime$ production at the LHC appears to be justified, our
implementation suffers from a stronger dependence on power corrections for
processes which are further away from threshold, such as $Z$ production at the
LHC, for which we cannot claim an improvement over standard $Q_T$ resummation.

extends cloud-computing capabilities to the edge of the Radio Access Network
(RAN) by deploying MEC servers right at the Base Stations (BSs). In this paper,
we envision a collaborative joint caching and processing strategy for on-demand
video streaming in MEC networks. Our design aims at enhancing the widely used
Adaptive BitRate (ABR) streaming technology, where multiple bitrate versions of
a video can be delivered so as to adapt to the heterogeneity of user
capabilities and the varying of network connection bandwidth. The proposed
strategy faces two main challenges: (i) not only the videos but their
appropriate bitrate versions have to be effectively selected to store in the
caches, and (ii) the transcoding relationships among different versions need to
be taken into account to effectively utilize the processing capacity at the MEC
servers. To this end, we formulate the collaborative joint caching and
processing problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that minimizes the
backhaul network cost, subject to the cache storage and processing capacity
constraints. Due to the NP-completeness of the problem and the impractical
overheads of the existing offline approaches, we propose a novel online
algorithm that makes cache placement and video scheduling decisions upon the
arrival of each new request. Extensive simulations results demonstrate the
significant performance improvement of the proposed strategy over traditional
approaches in terms of cache hit ratio increase, backhaul traffic and initial

leading order terms in the appearance channels when $\epsilon_{e\tau} =

find that overall DUNE has the best sensitivity to the magnitude of the NSI

there are NSI. Furthermore, for T2HKK a smaller off-axis angle for the Korean
detector is better overall. We find that due to the structure of the leading

studies have made striding advances in quantifying creativity of scientific
publications by investigating their citation relationships. Yet, little is
known hitherto about the underlying mechanisms governing scientific creative
processes, largely due to that a paper's references, at best, only partially
reflect its authors' actual information consumption. This work represents an
initial step towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in
scientific enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets

directly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against their

the shepherd moons Prometheus and Pandora, and Titan. We compute accurate
long-time numerical integrations of (about 2.5 million) non-interacting
test-particles initially located in the region between the orbits of Prometheus
and Pandora, and address whether they escape or remain trapped in this region.
We obtain a wide region of initial conditions of the test particles that remain
confined. We consider a dynamical stability indicator for the test particles'
motion defined by computing the ratio of the standard deviation over the
average value of relevant dynamical quantities, in particular, for the
mean-motion and the semi-major axis. This indicator separates clearly a subset
of trapped initial conditions that appear as very localized stripes in the
initial semi-major axis and eccentricity space for the most stable orbits.
Retaining only these test particles, we obtain a narrow eccentric ring which
displays sharp edges and collective alignment. The semi-major axis of the
accumulation stripes of the stable ring-particles can be associated with
resonances, mostly involving Prometheus' outer Lindblad and co-rotation
resonances, but not exclusively. Pandora's inner Lindblad and co-rotation
resonances as well as low-order three-body resonances typically coincide with
gaps, i.e., regions of instabilities. Comparison of our results with the

in the final state that are based on the 2012 pp collision data produced by the
LHC at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}}$ = 8 TeV. The efficiency of these algorithms,
together with the charge misidentification rate, is measured in data and
evaluated in simulated samples using electrons from $Z\rightarrow ee$,
$Z\rightarrow ee\gamma$ and $J/\psi \rightarrow ee$ decays. For these
efficiency measurements, the full recorded data set, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$, is used. Based on a new reconstruction
algorithm used in 2012, the electron reconstruction efficiency is 97% for
electrons with $E_\mathrm{T}=15$ GeV and 99% at $E_\mathrm{T} = 50$ GeV.
Combining this with the efficiency of additional selection criteria to reject
electrons from background processes or misidentified hadrons, the efficiency to
reconstruct and identify electrons at the ATLAS experiment varies from 65% to
95%, depending on the transverse momentum of the electron and background
rejection.

How does biological tissue absorb
electromagnetic radiation? Astonishingly, we do not have a definite answer to
these simple questions because the microscopic processes governing the
absorption of electromagnetic waves by water are largely unclarified. This
absorption can be quantified by dielectric loss spectra, which reveal a huge
peak at a frequency of the exciting electric field of about 20 GHz and a
gradual tailing off towards higher frequencies. The microscopic interpretation
of such spectra is highly controversial and various superpositions of
relaxation and resonance processes ascribed to single-molecule or
molecule-cluster motions have been proposed for their analysis. By combining
dielectric, microwave, THz, and far-infrared spectroscopy, here we provide
nearly continuous temperature-dependent broadband spectra of water. Moreover,
we find that corresponding spectra for aqueous solutions reveal the same
features as pure water. However, in contrast to the latter, crystallization in
these solutions can be avoided by supercooling. As different spectral
contributions tend to disentangle at low temperatures, this enables to
deconvolute them when approaching the glass transition under cooling. We find
that the overall spectral development, including the 20 GHz feature (employed
for microwave heating), closely resembles the behavior known for common
supercooled liquids. Thus, water's absorption of electromagnetic waves at room
temperature is not unusual but very similar to that of glass-forming liquids at
elevated temperatures, deep in the low-viscosity liquid regime, and should be
interpreted along similar lines.

accurately describe the behavior of Big Data clusters, it is too

overcome these issues by applying machine learning techniques. More precisely
we focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is intrinsically more robust

from characterization of the endpoint of black hole mergers to black hole
entropy. With an eye towards a canonical formulation we consider general
relativity in first order form. We focus on two issues: i) The role of the
internal gauge freedom in consistent formulations of the action principle, and
ii) the role a 3+1 decomposition has in the allowed internal gauge. We clarify
how the requirement of well posed variational principles compatible with
general weakly isolated horizons (WIHs) does lead to a partial gauge fixing in
the first order descriptions used previously in the literature. We consider the
Palatini action together with the Holst extension, with and without boundary
terms at the horizon. We show that, for the complete configuration space --with
no gauge fixing--, the Palatini action is differentiable without additional
surface terms at the WIH boundary, but the more general Holst action is not. A
surface term at the horizon --that renders the action for asymptotically flat
configurations differentiable-- makes the Holst action differentiable, but only
if one restricts configuration space and partially reduces the internal Lorentz
gauge. For the second issue, we show that upon performing a 3+1 decomposition
and imposing the time gauge, there is a further gauge reduction of the
Hamiltonian theory in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables to a $U(1)$-gauge
theory on the horizon. We show that even when the Holst action is
differentiable without additional surface terms or any gauge fixing for Type I
spherically symmetric (strongly) isolated horizons --and a preferred
foliation--, this result does not go through for more general isolated or
weakly isolated horizons. Our results represent the first comprehensive study
of these issues and clarify some contradictory statements found in the
literature.

spatio-temporal grouping of such proposals. This allows to jointly solve the

analysed and refuted in the present paper. The hypothesis of reductionism finds
no obstacle within contemporary natural sciences. Determinism in classical
physics is irrefutable, unless classical physics is itself refuted. From
quantum mechanics, some authors argue that free will is possible because there
is an ontological indeterminism in the natural laws, and that the mind is
responsible for the wave function collapse of matter, which leads to a choice
among the different possibilities for the body. However, here I defend the
opposite thesis because indeterminism does not imply free will, and because the
considerations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against
neuroscience or evolutionary theories about human beings. The quantum theory of
measurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but
other fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario. A fatalistic
or materialist view, which denies the possibility of a free will, makes much
more sense in scientific terms.

recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks.
Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved
problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently
the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these
require significant modifications to the training procedure and are
computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose
an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily
parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high
quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on
classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method
produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than
approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate
the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown
distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty
on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method
by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.

infinitely degenerate, and endowed with novel physical properties (e.g.,
negative thermal expansion behavior). In this paper, we focus on the disordered
regime in which there is no long-range order, and control the degree of
short-range order. We map these stealthy disordered hyperuniform point
configurations to two-phase media by circumscribing each point with a possibly
overlapping sphere of a common radius $a$: the ""particle"" and ""void"" phases are
taken to be the space interior and exterior to the spheres, respectively. We
study certain transport properties of these systems, including the effective
diffusion coefficient of point particles diffusing in the void phase as well as
static and time-dependent characteristics associated with diffusion-controlled
reactions. Besides these effective transport properties, we also investigate
several related structural properties, including pore-size functions, quantizer
error, an order metric, and percolation threshold. We show that these

studied. Memory is modeled using a finite-state Markov chain representing a
channel state. Two scenarios are considered: (i) when the transmitter has
causal knowledge of the channel state (i.e., the state is visible), and (ii)
when the channel state is unknown at the transmitter, but observations of it
are available at the transmitter through feedback (i.e., the state is hidden).
In both scenarios, matching outer and inner bounds on the rates of
communication are derived and the capacity region is determined. It is shown
that similar results carry over to channels with memory and delayed feedback
and memoryless compound channels with feedback. When the state is visible, the
capacity region has a single-letter characterization and is in terms of a
linear program. Two optimal coding schemes are devised that use feedback to
keep track of the sent/received packets via a network of queues: a
probabilistic scheme and a deterministic backpressure-like algorithm. The
former bases its decisions solely on the past channel state information and the
latter follows a max-weight queue-based policy. The performance of the
algorithms are analyzed using the frameworks of rate stability in networks of
queues, max-flow min-cut duality in networks, and finite-horizon Lyapunov drift
analysis. When the state is hidden, the capacity region does not have a
single-letter characterization and is, in this sense, uncomputable.
Approximations of the capacity region are provided and two optimal coding
algorithms are outlined. The first algorithm is a probabilistic coding scheme
that bases its decisions on the past L acknowledgments and its achievable rate
region approaches the capacity region exponentially fast in L. The second
algorithm is a backpressure-like algorithm that performs optimally in the long
run.

decreased sensitivity to small perturbations in the input. We establish that

an undirected graph $G$ and a collection of source destination pairs, and the
goal is to schedule a minimum-length sequence of matchings that connects every
source with its respective destination. Multi-commodity multicast models a
classic information dissemination problem in networks where the primary
communication constraint is the number of connections that a node can make, not
link bandwidth.
  Multi-commodity multicast is closely related to the problem of finding a
subgraph, $H$, of optimal poise, where the poise is defined as the sum of the
maximum degree of $H$ and the maximum distance between any source-destination
pair in $H$. We first show that the minimum poise subgraph for single-commodity
multicast can be approximated to within a factor of $O(\log k)$ with respect to
the value of a natural LP relaxation in an instance with $k$ terminals. This is
the first upper bound on the integrality gap of the natural LP. Using this
poise result and shortest-path separators in planar graphs, we obtain a
$O(\log^3 k\log n/(\log\log n))$-approximation for multi-commodity multicast
for planar graphs.
  We also study the minimum-time radio gossip problem in planar graphs where a
message from each node must be transmitted to all other nodes under a model
where nodes can broadcast to all neighbors in a single step but only nodes with
a single broadcasting neighbor get a message. We give an $O(\log^2
n)$-approximation for radio gossip in planar graphs breaking previous barriers.
This is the first bound for radio gossip that does not rely on the maximum
degree of the graph.
  Finally, we show that our techniques for planar graphs extend to graphs with
excluded minors. We establish polylogarithmic-approximation algorithms for both
multi-commodity multicast and radio gossip problems in minor-free graphs.

and used to derived water production rates for all comets. Comparisons are made
with the water production rates derived using an OPR of 3.
  The OPR of three of the comets in this study are much lower than the
statistical equilibrium value of 3, however they agree with observations of
comets 1P/Halley and C/2001 A2 (LINEAR), and the protoplanetary disc TW Hydrae.
These results provide evidence suggesting that OPR variation is caused by
post-sublimation gas-phase nuclear-spin conversion processes. The water
production rates of all comets agree with previous work and, in general,
decrease with increasing nucleocentric offset. This could be due to a
temperature profile, additional water source, or OPR variation in the comae, or

led to its increasing use in brain study through computational models. The
scale and complexity of such models are constantly increasing, leading to
challenging computational requirements. Even though modern HPC platforms can
often deal with such challenges, the vast diversity of the modeling field does
not permit for a single acceleration (or homogeneous) platform to effectively
address the complete array of modeling requirements. Approach: In this paper we
propose and build BrainFrame, a heterogeneous acceleration platform,
incorporating three distinct acceleration technologies, a Dataflow Engine, a
Xeon Phi and a GP-GPU. The PyNN framework is also integrated into the platform.
As a challenging proof of concept, we analyze the performance of BrainFrame on
different instances of a state-of-the-art neuron model, modeling the Inferior-
Olivary Nucleus using a biophysically-meaningful, extended Hodgkin-Huxley
representation. The model instances take into account not only the neuronal-
network dimensions but also different network-connectivity circumstances that
can drastically change application workload characteristics. Main results: The
synthetic approach of three HPC technologies demonstrated that BrainFrame is
better able to cope with the modeling diversity encountered. Our performance
analysis shows clearly that the model directly affect performance and all three
technologies are required to cope with all the model use cases.

the thin-shell estimate, Poincar\'{e} constant and Lipschitz concentration
constant and an alternative proof of this bound for the isotropic (slicing)
constant; it also follows that the ball walk for sampling from an isotropic
logconcave density in ${\bf R}^{n}$ converges in $O^{*}(n^{2.5})$ steps from a
warm start. The proof is based on gradually transforming any logconcave density
to one that has a significant Gaussian factor via a Martingale process.
  Extending this proof technique, we prove that the log-Sobolev constant of any
isotropic logconcave density in ${\bf R}^{n}$ with support of diameter $D$ is
$\Omega(1/D)$, resolving a question posed by Frieze and Kannan in 1997. This is
asymptotically the best possible estimate and improves on the previous bound of
$\Omega(1/D^{2})$ by Kannan-Lov\'{a}sz-Montenegro. It follows that for any
isotropic logconcave density, the ball walk with step size
$\delta=\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ mixes in $O\left(n^{2}D\right)$ proper steps from
\emph{any }starting point. This improves on the previous best bound of
$O(n^{2}D^{2})$ and is also asymptotically tight.
  The new bound leads to the following large deviation inequality for an
$L$-Lipschitz function $g$ over an isotropic logconcave density $p$: for any
$t>0$, \[ Pr_{x\sim p}\left(\left|g(x)-\bar{g}\right|\geq L\cdot
t\right)\leq\exp(-\frac{c\cdot t^{2}}{t+\sqrt{n}}) \] where $\bar{g}$ is the
median or mean of $g$ for $x\sim p$; this generalizes and improves on previous
bounds by Paouris and by Guedon-Milman. The technique also bounds the ``small
ball'' probability in terms of the Cheeger constant, and recovers the current
best bound.

using nine years of data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory in hybrid
operation mode. An unprecedented separation power between photon and hadron
primaries is achieved by combining measurements of the longitudinal air-shower
development with the particle content at ground measured by the fluorescence
and surface detectors, respectively. Only three photon candidates at energies 1
- 2 EeV are found, which is compatible with the expected hadron-induced
background. Upper limits on the integral flux of ultra-high energy photons of
0.038, 0.010, 0.009, 0.008 and 0.007 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derived
at 95% C.L. for energy thresholds of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 EeV. These limits bound
the fractions of photons in the all-particle integral flux below 0.14%, 0.17%,
0.42%, 0.86% and 2.9%. For the first time the photon fraction at EeV energies
is constrained at the sub-percent level. The improved limits are below the flux
of diffuse photons predicted by some astrophysical scenarios for cosmogenic
photon production. The new results rule-out the early top-down models $-$ in
which ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced by, e.g., the decay of
super-massive particles $-$ and challenge the most recent super-heavy dark
matter models.

Their
influence spans from DNA and molecular chemistry to vortices in superfluid

Here, we find that knotted structures also exist in a peculiar class of
three-dimensional topological insulators---the Hopf insulators. In particular,
we demonstrate that the momentum-space spin textures of Hopf insulators are
twisted in a nontrivial way, which implies the presence of various knot and
link structures. We further illustrate that the knots and nontrivial spin
textures can be probed via standard time-of-flight images in cold atoms as
preimage contours of spin orientations in stereographic coordinates. The
extracted Hopf invariants, knots, and links are validated to be robust to
typical experimental imperfections. Our work establishes the existence of
knotted structures in Hopf insulators, which may have potential applications in
spintronics and quantum information processing.

low star formation rates in massive galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters.
However, the detailed physics of the coupling of the injected feedback energy
with the intracluster medium is still unclear. Using high-resolution
magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation, we
investigate the role of anisotropic thermal conduction in shaping the
thermodynamic structure of clusters, and, in particular, in modifying the
impact of black hole feedback. Stratified anisotropically conducting plasmas
are formally always unstable, and thus more prone to mixing, an expectation
borne out by our results. The increased mixing efficiently isotropizes the
injected feedback energy which in turn significantly improves the coupling
between the feedback energy and the intracluster medium. This facilitates an
earlier disruption of the cool core, reduces the star formation rate by more
than an order of magnitude, and results in earlier quenching despite an overall
lower amount of feedback energy injected into the cluster core. With
conduction, the metallicity gradients and dispersions are lowered, aligning
them better with observational constraints. These results highlight the
important role of thermal conduction in establishing and maintaining quiescence
of massive galaxies.

derive age and metallicity gradients by fitting straight lines to the radial

inside-out formation scenario. Within our sample, we find that both the age and
metallicity gradients show weak or no correlation with either the LSS type or
local density environment. In addition, we also study the environmental
dependence of age and metallicity values at the effective radii. The age and
metallicity values are highly correlated with M* and NUV-r and are also
dependent on LSS type as well as local density. Low-mass galaxies tend to be
younger and have lower metallicity in low-density environments while high-mass

III stars based on N-body simulations of binary formation (including rates,
binary fraction, initial mass function, orbital separation and eccentricity
distributions) with an updated model of stellar evolution specific for Pop III
stars. We find that the merger rate of these Pop III BH-BH systems is
relatively small (< 0.1 Gpc^-3 yr^-1) at low redshifts (z<2), where it can be
compared with the LIGO empirical estimate of 9-240 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 (Abbott et al.
2016). The predicted rates are even smaller for Pop III double neutron star and
black hole neutron star mergers. Our rates are compatible with those of Hartwig
et al. (2016), but significantly smaller than those found in previous work
(Bond & Carr 1984; Belczynski et al. 2004; Kinugawa et al. 2014, 2016). We
explain the reasons for this discrepancy by means of detailed model comparisons
and point out that (i) identification of Pop III BH-BH mergers may not be
possible by advanced LIGO, and (ii) the level of stochastic gravitational wave
background from Pop III mergers may be lower than recently estimated (Kowalska
et al. 2012; Inayoshi et al. 2016; Dvorkin et al. 2016). We further estimate
gravitational wave detection rates for third-generation interferometric
detectors. Our calculations are relevant for low to moderately rotating Pop III
stars. We can now exclude significant (> 1 per cent) contribution of these
stars to low-redshift BH-BH mergers. However, it remains to be tested whether
(and at what level) rapidly spinning Pop III stars (homogeneous evolution) can
contribute to BH-BH mergers in the local Universe.

calculation of electron-phonon coupling in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ is particularly
intricate, as the commonly used Allen-Heine-Cardona theory overestimates the
band gap change with temperature, and excellent agreement with experiment is
only obtained when including high-order terms in the electron-phonon

to a caustic formed by matter at its first apocenter after infall. In this
paper, we present an algorithm to identify the ""splashback shell"" formed by
these apocenters in individual simulated halos using only a single snapshot of
the density field. We implement this algorithm in the code SHELLFISH (SHELL
Finding In Spheroidal Halos) and demonstrate that the code identifies
splashback shells correctly and measures their properties with an accuracy of
$<5\%$ for halos with more than 50,000 particles and mass accretion rates of
$\Gamma_\textrm{DK14}>0.5$. Using SHELLFISH, we present the first estimates for
several basic properties of individual splashback shells, such as radius,
$R_\textrm{sp}$, mass, and overdensity, and provide fits to the distribution of
these quantities as functions of $\Gamma_\textrm{DK14}$, $\nu_\textrm{200m}$,
and $z.$ We confirm previous findings that $R_\textrm{sp}$ decreases with
increasing $\Gamma_\textrm{DK14}$, but we show that independent of accretion
rate, it also decreases with increasing $\nu_\textrm{200m}$. We also study the
3D structures of these shells and find that they generally have non-ellipsoidal
oval shapes. We find that splashback radii estimated by SHELLFISH are
$20\%-30\%$ larger than those estimated in previous studies from stacked
density profiles at high accretion rates. We demonstrate that the latter are
biased low due to the contribution of high-mass subhalos to these profiles and
show that using the median instead of mean density in each radial bin mitigates
the effect of substructure on density profiles and removes the bias.

consistent with the viscous accumulation and release of gas in the inner disk
near the dead zone boundary. We suggest that outbursts are indirectly triggered
by stellar dynamo cycles, via poloidal magnetic flux that diffuses radially
outward through the disk. Interior to the dead zone the strength of the net
field modulates the efficiency of angular momentum transport by the
magnetorotational instability. In the dead zone changes in the polarity of the
net field may lead to stronger outbursts because of the dominant role of the
Hall effect in this region of the disk. At the level of simple estimates we
show that changes to kG-strength stellar fields could stimulate disk outbursts
on 0.1 AU scales, though this optimistic conclusion depends upon the uncertain
efficiency of net flux transport through the inner disk. The model predicts a
close association between observational tracers of stellar magnetic activity

use of galaxy shapes to measure cosmic shear has become routine. The
weak-lensing distortion tensor contains two other effects in addition to the
two components of shear: the convergence and rotation. The rotation mode is not
measurable using the standard cosmic shear estimators based on galaxy shapes,
as there is no information on the original shapes of the images before they
were lensed. Due to this, no estimator has been proposed for the rotation mode
in cosmological weak-lensing surveys, and the rotation mode has never been
constrained. Here, we derive an estimator for this quantity, which is based on
the use of radio polarisation measurements of the intrinsic position angles of
galaxies. The rotation mode can be sourced by physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and
also offers the chance to perform consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and of
weak-lensing surveys themselves. We present simulations of this estimator and
show that, for the pedagogical example of cosmic string spectra, this estimator
could detect a signal that is consistent with the constraints from Planck. We
examine the connection between the rotation mode and the shear $B$-modes and
thus how this estimator could help control systematics in future radio
weak-lensing surveys.

comparing their star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), galaxy

H$\alpha$-emitting cluster galaxies are $\log(r_{eff})\sim0.1$ larger than in
the field. Approximately 19% of the H$\alpha$-emitters in the cluster and 26%
in the field are IR-luminous ($L_{IR}>2\times10^{11} L_{\odot}$). Because the
LIRGs in our combined sample are $\sim5$ times more massive than the low-IR
galaxies, their radii are $\sim70$% larger. To track stellar growth, we
separate galaxies into those that lie above, on, and below the H$\alpha$
star-forming main sequence (SFMS) using $\Delta$SFR$(M_{\star})=\pm0.2$ dex.
Galaxies above the SFMS (starbursts) tend to have higher H$\alpha$ SFR surface
densities and younger light-weighted stellar ages compared to galaxies below
the SFMS. Our results indicate that starbursts (+SFMS) in the cluster and field
at $z\sim2$ are growing their stellar cores. Lastly, we compare to the
(SFR-$M_{\star}$) relation from RHAPSODY cluster simulations and find the
predicted slope is nominally consistent with the observations. However, the
predicted cluster SFRs tend to be too low by a factor of $\sim2$ which seems to
be a common problem for simulations across environment.

protoplanetary disks, thanks to the recent surveys with ALMA. The first
near-complete high-resolution disk survey in both dust and gas in a single
star-forming region has been carried out in Lupus, finding surprisingly low
gas/dust ratios. The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues
observations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in
order to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed
physical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations
of Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out. Employing
also the ALMA 13CO-only detections, disk gas masses have been calculated for a
total of 34 sources, expanding the sample of 10 disks studied by Ansdell et al.
(2016), where also C18O was detected. We confirm that overall gas-masses are
very low, often smaller than 1 $M_{\rm J}$, if volatile carbon is not depleted.
Accordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low
CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or
alternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to
more complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA
observations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated
both scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of
the two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous
processes over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current
mass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a
constant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed $M_{\rm
disk}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ ratio. This in turn points to a scenario in which
carbon depletion is responsible for the low CO isotopologue line luminosities.

their radial gradients, as well as full star formation and metal enrichment
histories. We also quanfify the impact that different stellar population models
and full spectral fitting routines have on the derived stellar population
properties, and the radial gradient measurements. In our analysis, we find that
age gradients tend to be shallow for both early-type and late-type galaxies.
{\em Mass-weighted} age gradients of early-types are positive ($\sim 0.09\;
{\rm dex}/R_{\rm e}$) pointing to ""outside-in"" progression of star formation,
while late-type galaxies have negative {\em light-weighted} age gradients
($\sim -0.11\; {\rm dex}/R_{\rm e}$), suggesting an ""inside-out"" formation of
discs. We detect negative metallicity gradients in both early and late-type
galaxies, but these are significantly steeper in late-types, suggesting that
radial dependence of chemical enrichment processes and the effect of gas inflow
and metal transport are far more pronounced in discs. Metallicity gradients of
both morphological classes correlate with galaxy mass, with negative
metallicity gradients becoming steeper with increasing galaxy mass. The
correlation with mass is stronger for late-type galaxies, with a slope of
$d(\nabla [Z/H])/d(\log M)\sim -0.2\pm 0.05\;$, compared to $d(\nabla
[Z/H])/d(\log M)\sim -0.05\pm 0.05\;$ for early-types. This result suggests
that the merger history plays a relatively small role in shaping metallicity
gradients of galaxies.

this construction by adding color to the images, with red, green and blue

Overall, the deep networks match or outperform traditional jet variables. We

for safety requirements specified by forward invariance of a set using a
Lyapunov-like condition. This paper develops several important extensions to

parameters influence polymer glass-formation. Given the fact that chain
rigidity often plays a critical role in understanding the glass-formation of
polymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of
semiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET
considered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected
results from computer simulations of fully flexible polymer melts concerning
the dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive
interaction strength ($\epsilon$), the present paper employs the GET to explore
the influence of $\epsilon$ on glass-formation in models of polymer melts with
a vanishing bending rigidity, i.e., fully flexible polymer melts. In accord
with simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts predicts that basic
dimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion
coefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the
temperature scaled by $\epsilon$ in the regime of low pressures. Similar
scaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the
GET for fully flexible polymer melts. Moreover, we find that the characteristic
temperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with $\epsilon$ and that the
fragility is independent of $\epsilon$ in fully flexible polymer melts,
predictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming polymer
melts composed of fully flexible chains. Beyond an explanation of these general
trends observed in simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts
predicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low
temperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low

leading-order term in the asymptotic expansion is related to the existence of
the conserved Newman-Penrose quantities on null infinity. As a corollary we
obtain a characterization of all solutions which satisfy Price's polynomial law
as a lower bound. Our analysis relies on physical space techniques and uses the
vector field approach for almost-sharp decay estimates introduced in our

outer communications up to and including the event horizon. Our work is
motivated by the stability problem for black hole exteriors and strong cosmic

that these relations are reliable up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the

conclude with a brief discussion about practical details regarding the required

strengthened version of a condition known in the literature as
$L^p$-dissipativity. Precisely, the regularity result is a reverse H\""older
condition for $L^p$ averages of solutions on interior balls, and serves as a
replacement for the De Giorgi - Nash - Moser regularity of solutions to
real-valued divergence form elliptic operators. In a series of papers, Cialdea
and Maz'ya studied necessary and sufficient conditions for $L^p$-dissipativity
of second order complex coefficient operators and systems. Recently, Carbonaro
and Dragi\v{c}evi\'c introduced a condition they termed $p$-ellipticity, and
showed that it had implications for boundedness of certain bilinear operators
that arise from complex valued second order differential operators. Their
$p$-ellipticity condition is exactly our strengthened version of
$L^p$-dissipativity. The regularity results of the present paper are applied to
solve $L^p$ Dirichlet problems for $\mathcal
L=$div$A(\nabla\cdot)+B\cdot\nabla$ when $A$ and $B$ satisfy a natural and

of string theory, most of them inaccessible to low-energy experiments, and
indicate the need to extract concrete scenarios and classes of models that
could eventually be contrasted with searches in collider physics and other
particle experiments as well as in cosmological observations. The impact that
this subfield has had in mathematics and in a better understanding of string

measuring the size and shape of extra dimensions, are highlighted as generic
low-energy remnants of string theory that can play a key role for supersymmetry

expression through cleavage and destruction of target mRNA. It is responsible
for a number of important intracellular functions, from being the first line of
immune defence against pathogens to regulating development and morphogenesis.
In this paper we consider a mathematical model of RNAi with particular emphasis
on time delays associated with two aspects of primed amplification: binding of
siRNA to aberrant RNA, and binding of siRNA to mRNA, both of which result in
the expanded production of dsRNA responsible for RNA silencing. Analytical and
numerical stability analyses are performed to identify regions of stability of
different steady states and to determine conditions on parameters that lead to
instability. Our results suggest that while the original model without time
delays exhibits a bi-stability due to the presence of a hysteresis loop, under
the influence of time delays, one of the two steady states with the high
(default) or small (silenced) concentration of mRNA can actually lose its
stability via a Hopf bifurcation. This leads to the co-existence of a stable
steady state and a stable periodic orbit, which has a profound effect on the
dynamics of the system.

we consider a typical delay-tolerant application scenario with a subset of

process using this strategy, and a closed form expression of the achievable

absorption around it. We use five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi
Bubble to constrain the velocity and column densities of outflowing gas traced

lines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high

outside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption
components. The observed outflow velocity profile decreases with Galactic
latitude and radial distance (R) from the Galactic Center. The observed
blueshifted velocities change from $v_{GSR}$=-265 km/s at R~2.3 kpc to
$v_{GSR}$=-91 km/s at R~6.5 kpc. We derive the metallicity of the entrained gas
along the 1H1613-097 sightline, which passes through the center of the northern

tuned to match the observed absorption component velocities along the five
lines of sight inside the Bubble, constrains the outflow velocities to
~1000$-$1300 km/s, and the age of the outflow to be ~ 6$-$9 Myr. We estimate a
minimum mass outflow rate for the nuclear outflow to be $\gtrsim$ 0.2 $\rm{

study, we assume that S2 is formed by irradiation (photolysis and/or
radiolysis) of S-bearing molecules embedded in the icy grain precursors of
comets, and that the cosmic ray flux simultaneously creates voids in ices
within which the produced molecules can accumulate. We investigate the
stability of S2 molecules in such cavities, assuming that the surrounding ice
is made of H2S or H2O. We show that the stabilization energy of S2 molecules in
such voids is close to that of the H2O ice binding energy, implying that they
can only leave the icy matrix when this latter sublimates. Because S2 has a
short lifetime in the vapor phase, we derive that its formation in grains via
irradiation must occur only in low density environments such as the ISM or the
upper layers of the protosolar nebula, where the local temperature is extremely
low. In the first case, comets would have agglomerated from icy grains that
remained pristine when entering the nebula. In the second case, comets would
have agglomerated from icy grains condensed in the protosolar nebula and that
would have been efficiently irradiated during their turbulent transport towards
the upper layers of the disk. Both scenarios are found consistent with the
presence of molecular oxygen in comets.

approximately 6e-6 Msun/yr, implying a young age of 10,000 years for this FHSC

the infall rate we obtain that the minimum source size is 1.5-5 AU consistent
with the size expected for a first core. We do not see any evidence of outflow

consistent with previous observations that revealed a very compact outflow

are hosted away from the users. In such a system information security is
considered as a major challenge. From a customer perspective, one of the big
risks in adopting big data systems is in trusting the provider who designs and
owns the infrastructure from accessing user data. Yet there does not exist much
in the literature on detection of insider attacks. In this work, we propose a
new system architecture in which insider attacks can be detected by utilizing
the replication of data on various nodes in the system. The proposed system
uses a two-step attack detection algorithm and a secure communication protocol
to analyze processes executing in the system. The first step involves the
construction of control instruction sequences for each process in the system.
The second step involves the matching of these instruction sequences among the
replica nodes. Initial experiments on real-world hadoop and spark tests show
that the proposed system needs to consider only 20% of the code to analyze a
program and incurs 3.28% time overhead. The proposed security system can be
implemented and built for any big data system due to its extrinsic workflow.

availability of contents, the spatial distribution of small cells, and the
caching strategies of competing content providers. It is showed to induce a

real-world applications are often caused by large intra-class variability,
arising from different lightings, occlusion and corruption, in limited sample
sets. Most methods in the literature would fail when the training samples are
heavily occluded, corrupted or have significant illumination or viewpoint
variations. Besides, most of the existing methods and especially deep
learning-based methods, need large training sets to achieve a satisfactory
recognition performance. Although using the pre-trained network on a generic
large-scale dataset and fine-tune it to the small-sized target dataset is a
widely used technique, this would not help when the content of base and target
datasets are very different. To address these issues, we propose a joint
projection and low-rank dictionary learning method using dual graph constraints
(JP-LRDL). The proposed joint learning method would enable us to learn the
features on top of which dictionaries can be better learned, from the data with
large intra-class variability. Specifically, a structured class-specific
dictionary is learned and the discrimination is further improved by imposing a
graph constraint on the coding coefficients, that maximizes the intra-class
compactness and inter-class separability. We also enforce low-rank and
structural incoherence constraints on sub-dictionaries to make them more
compact and robust to variations and outliers and reduce the redundancy among
them, respectively. To preserve the intrinsic structure of data and penalize
unfavourable relationship among training samples simultaneously, we introduce a
projection graph into the framework, which significantly enhances the
discriminative ability of the projection matrix and makes the method robust to
small-sized and high-dimensional datasets.

open-ended} nature of evolutionary change, from its definition to its origins.
Open-ended evolution (OEE) refers to the unbounded increase in complexity that
seems to characterise evolution on multiple scales. This property seems to be a
characteristic feature of biological and technological evolution and is
strongly tied to the generative potential associated with combinatorics, which
allows the system to grow and expand their available state spaces.
Interestingly, many complex systems presumably displaying OEE, from language to
proteins, share a common statistical property: the presence of Zipf's law.
Given an inventory of basic items (such as words or protein domains) required
to build more complex structures (sentences or proteins) Zipf's law tells us
that most of these elements are rare whereas a few of them are extremely
common. Using Algorithmic Information Theory, in this paper we provide a
fundamental definition for open-endedness, which can be understood as {\em
postulates}. Its statistical counterpart, based on standard Shannon Information
theory, has the structure of a variational problem which is shown to lead to
Zipf's law as the expected consequence of an evolutionary process displaying
OEE. We further explore the problem of information conservation through an OEE
process and we conclude that statistical information (standard Shannon
information) is not conserved, resulting into the paradoxical situation in
which the increase of information content has the effect of erasing itself. We
prove that this paradox is solved if we consider non-statistical forms of
information. This last result implies that standard information theory may not
be a suitable theoretical framework to explore the persistence and increase of
the information content in OEE systems.

that such pattern and other reported regularities from mutualistic webs can be
properly explained by means of a very simple model of speciation and

cataclysmic variable with broad, single-peaked Balmer and Paschen emission
lines along with HeII $\lambda4686$ and Bowen blend emission features. With
coverage of one full and two partial eclipses and archival photometry, we
determine the ephemeris for CX19 to be HJD(eclipse) = 2455691.8581(5) +
0.358704(2)$\times$N. We also recovered the white dwarf spin period of P$_{\rm
spin}$ = 503.32(3) seconds which gives a P$_{\rm spin}$/P$_{\rm orb}$ =
0.016(6), comparable to several confirmed, long period intermediate polars.
CX19 also shows a clear X-ray eclipse in the 0.3-8.0 keV range observed with
Chandra. Two optical outbursts were observed lasting between 6-8 hours (lower
limits) reaching $\sim$1.3 mags in amplitude. The outbursts, both in duration
and magnitude, the accretion disc dominated spectra and hard X-ray emission are
reminiscent of the intermediate polar V1223 Sgr sharing many of the same
characteristics. If we assume a main sequence companion, we estimate the donor
to be an early G-type star and find a minimum distance of $d \approx$ 2.1 kpc
and a 0.5-10.0 keV X-ray luminosity upper limit of 2.0 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. Such an X-ray luminosity is consistent with a white dwarf accretor in
a magnetic cataclysmic variable system. To date, CX19 is only the second
deeply-eclipsing intermediate polar with X-ray eclipses and the first which is
optically accessible.

half that of radial velocity surveys targeting solar neighborhood stars. One
hypothesis to explain this difference is that the two surveys target stars with
different stellar metallicity distributions. To test this hypothesis, we
measure the metallicity distribution of the Kepler targets using the
Hectochelle multi-fiber, high-resolution spectrograph. Limiting our
spectroscopic analysis to 610 dwarf stars in our sample with log(g)>3.5, we
measure a metallicity distribution characterized by a mean of [M/H]_{mean} =
-0.045 +/- 0.00, in agreement with previous studies of the Kepler field target
stars. In comparison, the metallicity distribution of the California Planet
Search radial velocity sample has a mean of [M/H]_{CPS, mean} = -0.005 +/-
0.006, and the samples come from different parent populations according to a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We refit the exponential relation between the fraction
of stars hosting a close-in giant planet and the host star metallicity using a
sample of dwarf stars from the California Planet Search with updated
metallicities. The best-fit relation tells us that the difference in
metallicity between the two samples is insufficient to explain the discrepant
Hot Jupiter occurrence rates; the metallicity difference would need to be
$\simeq$0.2-0.3 dex for perfect agreement. We also show that (sub)giant
contamination in the Kepler sample cannot reconcile the two occurrence
calculations. We conclude that other factors, such as binary contamination and
imperfect stellar properties, must also be at play.

BART (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees) allows for a much richer set of
possibilities than restrictive parametric approaches. However, subject matter
considerations sometimes warrant a minimal assumption of monotonicity in at
least some of the predictors. For such contexts, we introduce mBART, a
constrained version of BART that can flexibly incorporate monotonicity in any
predesignated subset of predictors using a multivariate basis of monotone
trees, while avoiding the further confines of a full parametric form. For such
monotone relationships, mBART provides (i) function estimates that are smoother
and more interpretable, (ii) better out-of-sample predictive performance, and
(iii) less post-data uncertainty. While many key aspects of the unconstrained
BART model carry over directly to mBART, the introduction of monotonicity
constraints necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how the model is
implemented. In particular, the original BART Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm relied on a conditional conjugacy that is no longer available in a
monotonically constrained space. Various simulated and real examples

there has been little understanding of underlying quantitative mechanisms

from 67 countries, ranging from Europe to Latin America, North America and
Asia. For all of the countries, we find a surprisingly uniform rule: Income
distribution for the great majority of populations (low and middle income
classes) follows an exponential law. To explain this empirical observation, we
propose a theoretical model within the standard framework of modern economics
and show that free competition and Rawls' fairness are the underlying
mechanisms producing the exponential pattern. The free parameters of the
exponential distribution in our model have an explicit economic interpretation
and direct relevance to policy measures intended to alleviate income
inequality.

$O(p,q)$-invariant Crofton formula. This is achieved by first obtaining a
handful of explicit formulas for a few sufficiently general signatures and
degrees of homogeneity, notably in the $(p-1)$ homogeneous case of $O(p,p)$,
yielding a Crofton formula for the centro-affine surface area when $p\not\equiv
3\mod 4$. We then exploit the functorial properties of Crofton formulas to pass
to the general case. We also identify the invariant formulas explicitly for all
$O(p,2)$-invariant valuations. The proof relies on the exact computation of
some integrals of independent interest. Those are related to Selberg's integral
and to the Beta function of a matrix argument, except that the
positive-definite matrices are replaced with matrices of all signatures. We
also analyze the distinguished invariant Crofton distribution supported on the
minimal orbit, and show that, somewhat surprisingly, it sometimes defines the
trivial valuation, thus producing a distribution in the kernel of the cosine
transform of particularly small support. In the heart of the paper lies the
description by Muro of the $|\det X|^s$ family of distributions on the space of
symmetric matrices, which we use to construct a family of $O(p,q)$-invariant
Crofton distributions. We conjecture there are no others, which we then prove
for $O(p,2)$ with $p$ even. The functorial properties of Crofton distributions,
which serve an important tool in our investigation, are studied by T. Wannerer

clustering technique to group together software libraries based on external
client usage. To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6,000

performances, but the exact physical scenario has not been established yet, due
to the inadequate understanding of the atomic dynamics and exceptional

of phonons, rotational modes of protons and molecular vibrational modes, which
is constructed by carrying out high-resolution time-of-flight inelastic neutron
scattering measurements in a wide energy window ranging from 0.0036 to 54 meV
on a large single crystal sample. A three-fold rotational mode of protons
activated around 80 K reduces the lifetimes of acoustic and optical phonons
down to about 4.5 ps and below 1 ps at 150 K, respectively. The orthorhombic to
tetragonal phase transition takes place with a slower four-fold rotational mode
of the C-N axis concomitantly setting in at ~ 165 K, above which the optical
phonons are too broadened to be distinguished whereas the acoustic ones are
still robust. The significantly reduced lifetimes of optical phonons are linked
to the smaller mobility of charge carriers while the ultralow lattice thermal
conductivity is attributed to nanoscale mean free paths of acoustic phonons.
These microscopic insights provide a solid standing point, on which perovskite
solar cells can be understood more accurately and their performances are
perhaps further optimized. The revealed rotor-phonon coupling opens up an
emergent opportunity to create unprecedented functionalities of materials.

the right-handed down-type quarks and has Yukawa couplings with the DM

segmentation in ultrasound images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in
estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from
hand-crafted descriptors and local information loss in the fitting procedure.
In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The
proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior
exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our
framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D
prostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate
shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn
the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). This module is corroborated to be effective in dealing with the
boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different
serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape
predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant
the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the
details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging
prostate ultrasound images, our framework bridges severe boundary
incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary
delineation when compared with several advanced methods. Additionally, our
approach is general and can be extended to other medical image segmentation
tasks, where boundary incompleteness is one of the main challenges.

inner relationships of images and videos in a common Hamming space. To further
improve the retrieval efficiency, we devise a Bilinear Binary Coding (BBC)

phases, the thermal conductivity tensor can be highly anisotropic when the
magnetic energy scale dominates, since the magnetic degrees of freedom dominate
the thermal transport for temperatures well below the magnetic transition

the thermal conductivity will be nearly isotropic, reflecting the isotropic (at

further discuss the extent to which thermal transport properties are influenced

field scan, two intermediate spin configurations stem from unsynchronized
magnetic switchings of the top and the bottom AFM/TI interfaces. These magnetic
configurations are shown to result in new topological phases with non-zero
Chern numbers for each surface, introducing two counter-propagating chiral edge
modes inside the exchange gap. This change in the number of transport channels,

Previously, oblivious random projection based approaches that project high
dimensional features onto a random subspace have been used in practice for
tackling high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. Recently, various
non-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for
solving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank
matrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine
learning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis
of excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of
generalization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious
randomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the
benefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based
approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for
employing non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk
minimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional
features are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data
with a small matrix approximation error. We then derive the first excess risk
bound for the proposed non-oblivious randomized reduction approach without
requiring strong assumptions on the training data. The established excess risk

stochastic partial differential equations with random coefficients, in which
the control systems are represented in an abstract evolution form, i.e.
backward stochastic evolution equations. Under some growth and monotonicity
conditions on the coefficients and suitable assumptions on the Hamiltonian
function, the existence of the optimal control boils down to proving the
uniqueness and existence of a solution to the stochastic Hamiltonian system,

the larger phase space for the ternary fragmentation is observed indicating

Ni + Ca is the most probable combination for the nucleus 252Cf. However, for
the nuclei 242Pu and 236U, the maximum fragmentation yields at T = 2 MeV differ
from those at T = 3 MeV. For T = 3 MeV, the closed shell (Z = 8) light mass
fragments with its corresponding partners has larger yield values. But, at T =

noticed that the symmetric binary fragmentation along with the fixed third

good candidate matches. We propose a simple coarse-to-fine strategy that uses
conservative approximations to robust local ratio-tests that can be computed

back-matching within candidate camera pose clusters, exploiting feature
co-visibility captured by clustering the 3D model camera pose graph. This
approach achieves state-of-the-art camera localization results on a variety of
popular benchmarks, outperforming several methods that use more complicated

also carry out diagnostic analyses on a difficult test dataset containing
globally repetitive structure that suggest our approach successfully adapts to

Therefore, our goal is to design and develop better alternate enumeration

alternate enumeration techniques which find all the subsets of Xn that add up
to sum S.
  In this paper, we present the mathematics behind this exponential problem. We
analyze the distribution of power set of Xn and present formulas which show
definite patterns and relations among these subsets. We introduce three major
distributions for power set of Xn: Sum Distribution, Length-Sum Distribution

constant. Given an approximation parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, the query can be
answered either way if the distance from $q$ to $K$'s boundary is at most
$\varepsilon$ times $K$'s diameter. Previous solutions to the problem were on
the form of a space-time trade-off, where logarithmic query time demands
$O(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})$ storage, whereas storage $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$
admits roughly $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/8})$ query time. In this paper, we
present a data structure that achieves logarithmic query time with storage of
only $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$, which matches the worst-case lower bound on
the complexity of any $\varepsilon$-approximating polytope. Our data structure
is based on a new technique, a hierarchy of ellipsoids defined as
approximations to Macbeath regions.
  As an application, we obtain major improvements to approximate Euclidean
nearest neighbor searching. Notably, the storage needed to answer
$\varepsilon$-approximate nearest neighbor queries for a set of $n$ points in
$O(\log \frac{n}{\varepsilon})$ time is reduced to $O(n/\varepsilon^{d/2})$.
This halves the exponent in the $\varepsilon$-dependency of the existing space
bound of roughly $O(n/\varepsilon^d)$, which has stood for 15 years (Har-Peled,
2001).

temperature and magnetic field. The doping dependence of the resistivity and
Hall number at low temperatures are characteristic of a system near a quantum
phase transition or a Fermi Surface Reconstruction (FSR) point. The spin
magnetoresistance drops to zero near the critical point. The data presented in
this paper were compiled during the 2004-2007 period but were never published
in this comprehensive form. Because of the recent interest in very similar
results now being found in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates, we believe
the results of our older, mostly unpublished, work will be of interest to the
present community of cuprate researchers. In particular, Fig.11 shows the large
change in Hall number at the FSR point in \PCCO, similar to that found recently
in YBCO and LSCO (See ref[1] and [2]). Also, Fig.6 illustrates how the
resistivity upturn is affected by the FSR. The cause of the resistivity upturn
has been attributed to the loss of carriers at doping below the FSR in the
hole-doped cuprates (see Ref. 3), however, this scenario does not explain the
data for PCCO. The upturn in n-doped cuprates is more-likely due to a
combination of carrier decrease and a change in the scattering rate below the
FSR (see also Ref. 4). The change in spin scattering below the FSR is
illustrated by Fig.18 in this paper. Chen et al. [5] have developed a model
based on spin scattering that is able to explain qualitatively the resistivity
upturn in all the cuprates.

relaxation processes in a general multiband electronic system with presumably
weak residual electron-electron interactions. The resulting memory-function
conductivity formula is shown to have the same structure as the result of a
more accurate approach based on the quantum kinetic equation. The results are
applied to heavily doped and lightly doped graphene. It is shown that the
scattering of conduction electron by phonons leads to the redistribution of the
intraband conductivity spectral weight over a wide frequency range, however, in
a way consistent with the partial transverse conductivity sum rule. The present
form of the intraband memory function is found to describe correctly the
scattering by quantum fluctuations of the lattice, at variance with the
semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations, where this scattering channel is
absent. This is shown to be of fundamental importance in quantitative
understanding of the reflectivity data measured in lightly doped graphene as
well as in different low-dimensional strongly correlated electronic systems,
such as the cuprate superconductors.

network. In this network, two source nodes communicate with each other with the
help of an amplify-and-forward relay which may perform Byzantine attacks by
forwarding altered symbols to the sources. For simple investigating the
detectability of attacks conducted in Gaussian channels, we focus on the MA
channel of the network, while assuming the BC channel is noiseless. Upon such
model, we propose a attack detection scheme implemented in the sources.
Specifically, we consider a open wireless propagation environment that allows
the symbols, forwarded by the relay, to go through a continuous channel and
arrive to the sources. With the observations of the source, we develop a
detection scheme for the source by comparing the joint empirical distribution
of its received and transmitted signals with the known channel statistics. The
main contribution of this paper is to prove that if and only if the Gaussian
relay network satisfies a non-manipulable channel condition, the proposed
detection scheme can detect arbitrary attacks that allows the stochastic
distributions of altered symbols to vary arbitrarily and depend on each other.
No pre-shared secret or secret transmission is needed for the detection.
Furthermore, we also prove that for the considered Gaussian two-way relay
networks, the non-manipulable channel condition is always satisfied. This
result indicates that arbitrary attacks conducted in MA Gaussian channels are
detectable by only using observations, while providing a base for attack
detection in more general Gaussian networks.

tropical vorticity forcing is examined with an emphasis on momentum fluxes and
the emergence of a superrotating (SR) state. Fixing the radiative damping and
momentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is
shown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity
forcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and
oppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the
equatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the
system into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum
drag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a
SR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also
exhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution
spontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It
is worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of
dissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any
large-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale
vorticity forcing is applied across the tropics. The statistically steady state
obtained is fairly turbulent in nature, but here too, the eddy fluxes dominate,
and the system exhibits SR. It is important to note that in both these cases,
the direct forcing of the zonal mean zonal flow is zero by construction, and
the eddy fluxes at the equator are responsible for its eastward acceleration.
Further, in both these examples, the rotational part of the flow dominates the
momentum fluxes as well as the stationary zonal mean zonal flow itself.
Arguments based on the nature of potential vorticity and enstrophy are put
forth to shed some light on these results.

violated in many strongly correlated electron systems, such as cuprate and

liquid theory is valid when the interaction-induced fermion damping rate
approaches zero more rapidly than the energy. Otherwise, it is invalid. Here,
we demonstrate that this criterion breaks down in topological double-and

indicates a weaker-than-marginal violation of the Fermi liquid theory. Such an
unconventional non-Fermi liquid state originates from the special dispersion of
double- and triple-Weyl fermions, and is qualitatively different from all the
other Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid states. The predicted properties of the
fermion damping rate and the spectral function can be probed by the
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The density of states, specific

are of essential importance in the conceptualization of molecular structure,

molecular surface and structural representation, and offers the basis for
molecular visualization, which is crucial for the understanding of molecular
structure and interactions. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between
molecular structural data and theoretical/mathematical models. Topological
analysis and modeling give rise to atomic critical points and connectivity, and
shed light on the intrinsic topological invariants such as independent
components (atoms), rings (pockets) and cavities. Graph theory analyzes
biomolecular interactions and reveals biomolecular structure-function
relationship. In this paper, we review certain geometric, topological and graph
theory apparatuses for biomolecular data modeling and analysis. These
apparatuses are categorized into discrete and continuous ones. For discrete
approaches, graph theory, Gaussian network model, anisotropic network model,
normal mode analysis, quasi-harmonic analysis, flexibility and rigidity index,
molecular nonlinear dynamics, spectral graph theory, and persistent homology
are discussed. For continuous mathematical tools, we present discrete to
continuum mapping, high dimensional persistent homology, biomolecular geometric
modeling, differential geometry theory of surfaces, curvature evaluation,
variational derivation of minimal molecular surfaces, atoms in molecule theory
and quantum chemical topology. Four new approaches, including analytical
minimal molecular surface, Hessian matrix eigenvalue map, curvature map and
virtual particle model, are introduced for the first time to bridge the gaps in
biomolecular modeling and analysis.

broader in the CDMFT mostly due to numerical artifacts linked to more

conserving' dynamics of a 2D martensitic structural transition from a
square-to-rectangle unit cell. The one-component or $N_{\rm OP} =1$ order
parameter is one of the physical strains, and the Landau free energy has a
triple well, describing a first-order transition. We numerically study the
evolution of the strain-strain correlation, and find that it exhibits dynamical
scaling, with a coarsening length $L(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$. We find at
intermediate and long times that the coarsening exponent sequentially takes on
respective values close to $\alpha=2/3$ and $\alpha=1/2$. For deep quenches,
the coarsening can be arrested at long times, with $\alpha \simeq 0$. These
exponents are also found in 3D. To understand such behaviour, we insert a
dynamical-scaling ansatz into the correlation function dynamics to give, at a
dominant scaled separation, a nonlinear kinetics of the curvature $g (t) \equiv
1/ L(t)$. The curvature solutions have time windows of power-law decays $g \sim
1/t^\alpha$, with exponent values $\alpha$ matching simulations, and manifestly
independent of spatial dimension. Applying this curvature-kinetics method to
mass-conserving Cahn-Hilliard dynamics for a double-well Landau potential in a
scalar $N_{\rm OP}=1$ order parameter yields exponents $\alpha = 1/4$ and $1/3$
for intermediate and long times. For vector order parameters with $N_{\rm OP}
\geq 2$, the exponents are $\alpha = 1/4$ only, consistent with previous work.
The curvature kinetics method could be useful in extracting coarsening
exponents for other phase-ordering dynamics.

elevate and absorption can suppress the observed chromospheric activity of

learning or decoding. We propose a model for direct speech-to-text translation,
which gives promising results on a small French-English synthetic corpus.
Relaxing the need for source language transcription would drastically change
the data collection methodology in speech translation, especially in
under-resourced scenarios. For instance, in the former project DARPA TRANSTAC
(speech translation from spoken Arabic dialects), a large effort was devoted to
the collection of speech transcripts (and a prerequisite to obtain transcripts
was often a detailed transcription guide for languages with little standardized
spelling). Now, if end-to-end approaches for speech-to-text translation are
successful, one might consider collecting data by asking bilingual speakers to
directly utter speech in the source language from target language text
utterances. Such an approach has the advantage to be applicable to any
unwritten (source) language.

characterised by a distinct canonical value of the vertical component of the
magnetic field, $B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$. In order to trigger the formation
of a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In
sunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas
and granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral
regions with $B_{\rm ver} < B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$, as well as in granular
convective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at
$B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$. Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra
initiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire
pore ultimately. We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution
of the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the
magnetic field properties in the studied region. The penumbra forms at the
boundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA\,10960.
As the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the
forming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux.
Consequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra.
At all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is
smaller than $B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver} \approx 1.8$~kG. Our findings are in an
agreement with the need of $B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$ for establishing a stable
umbra-penumbra boundary: while $B_{\rm ver}$ in the pore is smaller than
$B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$, the protrusion of penumbral grains into the pore
area is not blocked, a stable pore-penumbra boundary does not establish, and
the pore is fully overtaken by the penumbral magneto-convective mode. This
scenario could also be one of the mechanisms giving rise to orphan penumbrae.

successfully used in radar and communication to increase the amount of

compression needs to be applied at each transducer element, the implementation
of coded excitation (CE) in array imaging is computationally complex. Applying
pulse compression on the beamformer output reduces the computational load but
also degrades both the axial and lateral point spread function (PSF)
compromising image quality. In this work we present an approach for efficient
implementation of pulse compression by integrating it into frequency domain
beamforming. This method leads to significant reduction in the amount of
computations without affecting axial resolution. The lateral resolution is
dictated by the factor of savings in computational load. We verify the
performance of our method on a Verasonics imaging system and compare the
resulting images to time-domain processing. We show that up to 77 fold
reduction in computational complexity can be achieved in a typical imaging

schemes for linear diffusion problems recently proposed in [38]. In contrast to
the conventional approach, the diffusion coefficient enters both the primary
mimetic operator, i.e., the discrete divergence, and the inner product in the
space of gradients. The diffusion coefficient is therefore evaluated on
different mesh locations, i.e., inside mesh cells and on mesh faces. Such a
staggered discretization may provide the exibility necessary for future
development of efficient numerical schemes for nonlinear problems, especially
for problems with degenerate coefficients. These new mimetic schemes preserve
symmetry and positive-definiteness of the continuum problem, which allow us to
use efficient algebraic solvers such as the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient

clearly defined: the publishing scientist who is still active and working.
Thus, citations are a target-oriented metric which measures impact on science.
In contrast, societal impact measurements based on altmetrics are as a rule
intended to measure impact in a broad sense on all areas of society (e.g.
science, culture, politics, and economics). This tendency is especially
reflected in the efforts to design composite indicators (e.g. the Altmetric
attention score). We deem appropriate that not only the impact measurement
using citations is target-oriented (citations measure the impact of papers on
scientists), but also the measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact
measurements only make sense, if the target group - the recipient of academic
papers - is clearly defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized
reader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on
Mendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented
field-normalized impact indicator (e.g., MNRS_ED measures reader impact on the
sector of educational donation, i.e., teaching). This indicator can show - as
demonstrated in empirical examples - the ability of journals, countries, and
academic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average
impact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g., the educational or
teaching sector). For example, the method allows to measure the impact of
scientific papers on students - controlling for the field in which the papers
have been published and their publication year.

nanodecorated surfaces via free energy molecular dynamics simulations. The
results shed light on the stability of superhydrophobicity in submerged
surfaces with nanoscale corrugations. The re-entrant geometry of the cavities
under investigation is capable of sustaining a confined vapor phase within the
surface roughness (Cassie state) both for hydrophobic and hydrophilic
combinations of liquid and solid. The atomistic system is of nanometric size;
on this scale thermally activated events can play an important role ultimately
determining the lifetime of the Cassie state. Such superhydrophobic state can
break down by full wetting of the texture at large pressures (Cassie-Wenzel
transition) or by nucleating a vapor bubble at negative pressures (cavitation).
Specialized rare event techniques show that several pathways for wetting and
cavitation are possible, due to the complex surface geometry. The related free
energy barriers are of the order of 100 k_B T and vary with pressure. The
atomistic results are found to be in semi-quantitative accord with macroscopic
capillarity theory. However, the latter is not capable of capturing the density
fluctuations, which determine the destabilization of the confined liquid phase
at negative pressures (liquid spinodal).

inhomogeneous plasmas have indicated that the effects of the irregular solar
wind may account for the poor agreement of homogeneous modelling with the
observations. Quasi-linear theory and Hamiltonian models based on Zakharov's
equations have indicated that when a level of density fluctuations is above a
given threshold, density irregularities act to de-resonate the beam-plasma
interaction, restricting Langmuir wave growth on the expense of beam energy.
This work presents the first fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations
of beam relaxation under the influence of density irregularities. We aim to
independently determine the influence of background inhomogeneity on the
beam-plasma system, and to test theoretical predictions and alternative models
using a fully kinetic treatment. We carry out 1D PIC simulations of a
bump-on-tail unstable electron beam in the presence of increasing levels of
background inhomogeneity using the fully electromagnetic, relativistic EPOCH
PIC code. We find that in the case of homogeneous background plasma density,
Langmuir wave packets are generated at the resonant condition and then
quasi-liear relaxation leads to a dynamic increase of wavenumbers generated. No
electron acceleration is seen - unlike in the inhomogeneous experiments, all of
which produce high-energy electrons. For the inhomogeneous experiments we also
observe the generation of backwards propagating Langmuir waves, which is shown
directly to be due to the refraction of the packets off the density gradients.
Our fully kinetic PIC simulations broadly confirm the findings of quasi-linear
theory and the Hamiltonian model based on Zakharov's equations. Strong density
fluctuations modify properties of excited Langmuir waves altering their
dispersion properties.

use of digital devices presents a huge opportunity for policymakers to improve
their knowledge of the local environment and thus make more informed and better
decisions. A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the
type of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs,
Internet searches and contributions to social media platforms, and the extent
to which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This
paper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which
local commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It
makes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that simple heuristics
drawn from geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting
patterns; one which outperforms the major existing method for estimating these
patterns (the radiation model). Second, it investigates sources of error in the
proxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with
higher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds
that, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact
that the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the
population as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond
simple heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.

formation during the epoch of reionization in an effort towards modelling the
interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting ALMA observations. Simulations with
and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens
of kpc), and small (sub kpc) scales. At large scales, the dense regions around
galaxies reionize first before UV photons penetrate the voids; however,
considerable amounts of neutral gas remain present within the haloes. The
spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anti-correlated
with the presence of stars older than a few Myrs. For our specific feedback
implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of haloes and
they are proportionally distributed over the ionized and neutral medium by
mass. For our most massive galaxy with ${\rm M_h}\sim10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$, the
majority of the CII and OI mass are associated with cold neutral clumps. NII is
more diffuse and arises in warmer gas while OIII arises in hotter gas with a
higher ionization parameter, produced by photo-heating and supernovae. If
smaller pockets of high metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from
these ions may be observable by ALMA while the low metallicity of the galaxy
may cause these systems to fall below the local [CII]-SFR relation. The
presence of dust can cause spatial offsets between UV/Ly$\alpha$ and [CII]
emission as suggested by the recent observations of Maiolino et al. [OIII] may
be spatially offset from both of these components since it arises from a
different part of density-temperature phase-space.

approach (where each service provider stores and manages identities) to a
federated identity management system (where the identity management is
delegated to a set of identity providers). On the one hand, federated identity
ensures usability and provides economic benefits to service providers. On the
other hand, it poses serious privacy threats to users as well as service
providers. The current technology, which is prevalently deployed on the
Internet, allows identity providers to track the user's behavior across a broad
range of services.
  In this work, we propose PRIMA, a universal credential-based authentication
system for supporting federated identity management in a privacy-preserving
manner. Basically, PRIMA does not require any interaction between service
providers and identity providers during the authentication process, thus
preventing identity providers to profile users' behavior. Moreover, throughout
the authentication process, PRIMA provides a mechanism for controlled
disclosure of the users' private information. We have conducted comprehensive
evaluations of the system to show the feasibility of our approach. Our
performance analysis shows that an identity provider can process 1,426 to 3,332

their connection line(s) in addition to the relative distances between the
images, their ellipticities and time-delays. For two symmetric images that
straddle the critical curve, the orientation angle additionally allows to
determine the slope of the critical curve and a second (reduced) flexion
coefficient at the critical point on the connection line between the images. It
also allows to drop the symmetry assumption that the axis of largest image
extension is orthogonal to the critical curve. For three images almost forming
a giant arc, the degree of assumed image symmetry is also reduced to the most
general case, allowing to describe image configurations for which the source
need not be placed on the symmetry axis of the two folds that unite at the
cusp. For a given set of multiple images, we set limits on the applicability of
our approach, show which information can be obtained in cases of merging
images, and analyse the accuracy achievable due to the Taylor expansion of the
lensing potential for the fold case on a galaxy cluster scale NFW-profile, a
fold and cusp case on a galaxy cluster scale SIE-profile, and compare the
generalised approach with the one of Wagner & Bartelmann (2016). The position
of the critical points is reconstructed with less than 5"" deviation for
multiple images closer to the critical points than 30\% of the (effective)

$\zeta$ is associated with a dark matter component $\rho_{\rm m}$ only, the
dark energy component considered inviscid. Shear viscosity is omitted. We
assume throughout the simple equation of state $p=w\rho$, with $w$ a constant.
In the one-component model we consider two possibilities, either to take
$\zeta$ proportional to the scalar expansion (equivalent to the Hubble
parameter), in which case the evolution becomes critically dependent on the
value of the small constant $\alpha=1+w$ and the magnitude of $\zeta$. Second,
we consider the case $\zeta=~$const., where a de Sitter final stage is reached
in the future. In the two-component model we consider only the case where the
dark matter viscosity $\zeta_{\rm m}$ is proportional to the square of
$\rho_{\rm m}$, where again a de Sitter form is found in the future. In this
latter case the formalism is supplemented by a phase space analysis. As a
general result of our considerations we suggest that a value $\zeta_0\sim
10^6~$Pa s for the present viscosity is reasonable, and that the two-component

into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong
electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In
geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without
long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic
material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated
with crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in
the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO
patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes
that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization
of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of
the liquid-glass transition.

output the same solution on most computation paths. We establish
unconditionally that there is an infinite sequence $\{p_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$
of increasing primes and a randomized algorithm $A$ running in expected
sub-exponential time such that for each $n$, on input $1^{|p_n|}$, $A$ outputs
$p_n$ with probability $1$. In other words, our result provides a
pseudodeterministic construction of primes in sub-exponential time which works
infinitely often.
  This result follows from a much more general theorem about
pseudodeterministic constructions. A property $Q \subseteq \{0,1\}^{*}$ is
$\gamma$-dense if for large enough $n$, $|Q \cap \{0,1\}^n| \geq \gamma 2^n$.
We show that for each $c > 0$ at least one of the following holds: (1) There is
a pseudodeterministic polynomial time construction of a family $\{H_n\}$ of
sets, $H_n \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, such that for each $(1/n^c)$-dense property $Q
\in \mathsf{DTIME}(n^c)$ and every large enough $n$, $H_n \cap Q \neq

$(1/n^c)$-dense property $Q \in \mathsf{DTIME}(n^c)$ and for infinitely many
values of $n$, $H'_n \cap Q \neq \emptyset$.
  We provide further algorithmic applications that might be of independent
interest. Perhaps intriguingly, while our main results are unconditional, they
have a non-constructive element, arising from a sequence of applications of the
hardness versus randomness paradigm.

machine load. When a job arrives, we are allowed to reassign some jobs as long
as their total size is (at most) proportional to the processing time of the
arriving job. The proportionality constant is called the migration factor of
the algorithm. Using a rounding procedure with useful structural properties for
online packing and covering problems, we design first a simple $(1.7 +
\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm using a migration factor of
$O(1/\varepsilon)$ which maintains at every arrival a locally optimal solution
with respect to the Jump neighborhood. After that, we present as our main
contribution a more involved $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm using a
migration factor of $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$. At every arrival, we run an
adaptation of the Largest Processing Time first (LPT) algorithm. Since the new
job can cause a complete change of the assignment of smaller jobs in both
cases, a low migration factor is achieved by carefully exploiting the highly
symmetric structure obtained by the rounding procedure.

wireless communication and implements it in an ARM platform. The scheme
compresses the digital audio signal decoded by a sound card and then encrypts
it with a three-level chaotic encryption scheme. First, the position of every
bit of the compressed data is permuted randomly with a pseudo-random number
sequence (PRNS) generated by a 6-D chaotic map. Then, the obtained data are
further permuted in the level of byte with a PRNS generated by a 7-D chaotic
map. Finally, it is operated with a multiround chaotic stream cipher. The whole
system owns the following merits: the redundancy in the original audio file is
reduced effectively and the corresponding unicity distance is increased; the
balancing point between a high security level of the system and real-time
conduction speed is achieved well. In the ARM implementation, the framework of
communication of multicast-multiuser in a subnet and the Internet Group Manage
Protocol is adopted to obtain the function of communication between one client
and other ones. Comprehensive test results were provided to show the
feasibility and security performance of the whole system.

The high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects PKS 2155-304 (z = 0.116) and PG
1553+113 (0.43 < z < 0.58) are among the brightest objects in the gamma-ray

interpreted as being due to interactions with the extragalactic background
light (EBL). Multiple observational campaigns of PKS 2155-304 and PG 1553+113
were conducted during 2013 and 2014 using the full H.E.S.S. II instrument. A
monoscopic analysis of the data taken with the new CT5 telescope was developed
along with an investigation into the systematic uncertainties on the spectral
parameters. The energy spectra of PKS 2155-304 and PG 1553+113 were
reconstructed down to energies of 80 GeV for PKS 2155-304, which transits near
zenith, and 110 GeV for the more northern PG 1553+113. The measured spectra,
well fitted in both cases by a log-parabola spectral model (with a 5.0 sigma
statistical preference for non-zero curvature for PKS 2155-304 and 4.5 sigma
for PG 1553+113), were found consistent with spectra derived from
contemporaneous Fermi-LAT data, indicating a sharp break in the observed
spectra of both sources at E ~ 100 GeV. When corrected for EBL absorption, the
intrinsic H.E.S.S. II mono and Fermi-LAT spectrum of PKS 2155-304 was found to
show significant curvature. For PG 1553+113, however, no significant detection
of curvature in the intrinsic spectrum could be found within statistical and
systematic uncertainties.

nuclei under the nuclear statistical equilibrium. We reformulate the model of
the light nuclei other than $d$, $t$, $h$ and $\alpha$ based on the
quasi-particle description. Furthermore, we modify the model so that the
temperature dependences of surface and shell energies of heavy nuclei could be
taken into account. The pasta phases for heavy nuclei and the Pauli- and
self-energy shifts for $d$, $t$, $h$ and $\alpha$ are taken into account in the
same way as in the previous model. We find that nuclear composition is
considerably affected by the modifications in this work, whereas
thermodynamical quantities are not changed much. In particular, the washout of
shell effect has a great impact on the mass distribution above $T \sim 1$ MeV.
This improvement may have an important effect on the rates of electron captures
and coherent neutrino scatterings on nuclei in supernova cores.

in some sense, complementary to the Szekeres models. The structure of this
class of spacetimes can be regarded as a generalization of the (twist-free)
Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) geometries without any global isometry
containing, however, these models as special cases. We consider geometries
where a six-dimensional algebra $\mathcal{IC}$ of Intrinsic Conformal Vector
Fields (ICVFs) exists acting on a $2-$dimensional (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold.
Its members $\mathbf{X}_{\alpha }$, constituted of 3 Intrinsic Killing Vector
Fields (IKVFs) and 3 \emph{proper} and \emph{gradient} ICVFs, as well as the
specific form of the gravitational field are given explicitly. An interesting
consequence, in contrast with the Szekeres models, is the immediate existence
of \emph{conserved quantities along null geodesics}. We check computationally
that the magnetic part $H_{ab}$ of the Weyl tensor vanishes whereas the shear
$\sigma_{ab}$ and the electric part $E_{ab}$ share a common eigenframe
irrespective of the fluid interpretation of the models. A side result is the
fact that the spacetimes are foliated by a set of \emph{conformally flat }
$3-$dimensional \emph{timelike} slices when the anisotropy of the
\emph{flux-free} fluid is described only in terms of the 3 \emph{principal
inhomogeneous ""pressures""} $p_{\alpha}$ or equivalently when the Ricci tensor
shares the same basis of eigenvectors with $\sigma_{ab}$ and $E_{ab}$. The
conformal flatness also indicates that a \emph{10-dimensional algebra} of ICVFs
$\mathbf{\Xi}$ acting on the $3-$dimensional timelike slices is highly possible
to exist enriching in that way the set of conserved quantities admitted by the
SI models found in the present paper.

deviates from the actual one obtained in the multi-nucleus description, since
the density of free nucleons is different between these two descriptions. This

Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O
ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a
challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for
exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different
regimes. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may
emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary
evolution. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed
formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by
gas-surface reactions. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich
atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases due to carbon being a very effective
growth species. The consequence is that less particles will make up a cloud for
C/O_0>1. The cloud particles will be smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich
atmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because
a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a rich carbon
environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon
dominates if C/O_0>1 and silicates dominate if C/O_0<1. 80-90% carbon is
reached only in extreme cases where C/O_0=3.0 or 10.0. Carbon-rich atmospheres
would form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed
compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas-phase is far less depleted
than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in
combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud
cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.

present within a particle-rich background fluid, can be self-assembled from
colloidal particles interacting via isotropic pair interactions with competing
attractions and repulsions. While such structures could be of wide interest for
technological applications (e.g., filtration, catalysis, absorption, etc.),
relatively few studies have investigated the interactions that lead to these
morphologies and how they compare to those that produce other
micro-phase-separated structures, such as clusters. In this work, we use
inverse methods of statistical mechanics to design model isotropic pair
potentials that form porous mesophases. We characterize the resulting porous
structures, correlating features of the pair potential with the targeted pore
size and the particle packing fraction. The former is primarily encoded by the
amplitude and range of the repulsive barrier of the designed pair potential and
the latter by the attractive well depth. We observe a trade-off with respect to
the packing fraction of the targeted morphology: greater values support more
spherical and monodisperse pores that themselves organize into periodic
structures, while lower values yield more mobile pores that do not assemble
into ordered structures but remain stable over a larger range of packing
fraction. We conclude by commenting on the limitations of targeting a specific
pore diameter within the present inverse design approach as well as by
describing future directions to overcome these limitations.

the non-uniqueness of the fiducial distribution is well known, we propose to
use the geometric mean of the ""extreme cases"" and show its good behavior with
respect to the more traditional arithmetic mean. Connections with the
generalized fiducial inference approach developed by Hannig and with confidence
distributions are also analyzed. The suggested procedure strongly simplifies
when the statistical model belongs to a subclass of the natural exponential
family, called conditionally reducible, which includes the multinomial and the
negative-multinomial models. Furthermore, because fiducial inference and
objective Bayesian analysis are both attempts to derive distributions for an
unknown parameter without any prior information, it is natural to discuss their
relationships. In particular, the reference posteriors, which also depend on
the importance ordering of the parameters are the natural terms of comparison.
We show that fiducial and reference posterior distributions coincide in the
location-scale models, and we characterize the conditionally reducible natural
exponential families for which this happens. The discussion of some classical
examples closes the paper.

significant challenge for signal detection and recovery. For recordings from a
surface sensor array where each trace contains a time-delayed arrival from the
event, we propose an autocorrelation-based stacking method that designs a
denoising filter from all the traces, as well as a multi-channel detection
scheme. This approach circumvents the issue of time aligning the traces prior
to stacking because every trace's autocorrelation is centered at zero in the
lag domain. The effect of white noise is concentrated near zero lag, so the
filter design requires a predictable adjustment of the zero-lag value.
Truncation of the autocorrelation is employed to smooth the impulse response of
the denoising filter. In order to extend the applicability of the algorithm, we
also propose a noise prewhitening scheme that addresses cases with colored
noise. The simplicity and robustness of this method are validated with
synthetic and real seismic traces.

confinement of quarks and gluons, as well as kinematical constraints which
limit the accessible energy scales. We here show how continuum extrapolated
lattice data may overcome such problems and provide excellent probes of
renormalized perturbation theory. This work corresponds to an essential step in
the ALPHA collaboration's project to determine the $\Lambda$-parameter in
3-flavour QCD. I explain the basic techniques used in the high energy regime,
namely the use of mass-independent renormalization schemes for the QCD coupling
constant in a finite Euclidean space time volume. When combined with finite
size techniques this allows one to iteratively step up the energy scale by
factors of 2, thereby quickly covering two orders of magnitude in scale. We may
then compare perturbation theory (with $\beta$-functions available up to 3-loop
order) to our non-perturbative data for a 1-parameter family of running
couplings. We conclude that a target precision of 3 percent for the
$\Lambda$-parameter requires non-perturbative data up to scales where
$\alpha_s\approx 0.1$, whereas the apparent precision obtained from applying
perturbation theory around $\alpha_s \approx 0.2$ can be misleading. This
should be taken as a general warning to practitioners of QCD perturbation
theory.

accelerated and exponential expansion of its volume, as well as the vanishing
of its relative uncertainty which suggests the classicalization of the quantum
geometry. The dynamics of the emergent space can then be given in terms of the
classical Friedmann equations. In contrast to models based on complex-valued
fields, solutions avoiding the singularity problem can only be found if the
initial conditions are appropriately chosen. We then turn to the analysis of
the influence of effective interactions on the dynamics by studying in

fine-tuning, an epoch of inflationary expansion of quantum geometric origin can

prediction system that was employed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the
period 21-Sep-2016 to 11-Oct-2016. It is a follow-up to a previous paper in
which the prices were predicted and published before September 21. Stock market
price prediction remains an important quest for investors and researchers. This
research used an Artificial Intelligence system, being an Artificial Neural
Network that is feedforward multi-layer perceptron with error backpropagation
for prediction, unlike other methods such as technical, fundamental or time
series analysis. While these alternative methods tend to guide on trends and
not the exact likely prices, neural networks on the other hand have the ability
to predict the real value prices, as was done on this research. Nonetheless,
determination of suitable network parameters remains a challenge in neural
network design, with this research settling on a configuration of 5:21:21:1
with 80% training data or 4-year of training data as a good enough model for
stock prediction, as already determined in a previous research by the author.
The comparative results indicate that neural network can predict typical stock
market prices with mean absolute percentage errors that are as low as 1.95%
over the ten prediction instances that was studied in this research.

on a Minkowski base space. We assume space-time is non-commutative due to the
existence of additional non-commutative algebraic structure at each point x of
space-time, forming a quantum operator 'fibre algebra' A(x). This structure
then corresponds to the single fibre of a fibre bundle. A gauge group acts on
each fibre algebra locally, while a 'section' through this bundle is then a
quantum field of the form {A(x); x in M} with M the underlying space-time
manifold. In addition, we assume a local algebra O(D) corresponding to the
algebra of sections of such a principal fibre bundle with base space a finite
and bounded subset of space-time, D. The algebraic operations of addition and
multiplication are assumed defined fibrewise for this algebra of sections. We
characterise 'ergodic' extremal quantum states of the fibre algebra invariant
under the subgroup T of local translations of space-time of the Poincare group
P in terms of a non-commutative extension of entropy applied to the subgroup T.
We also characterise the existence of T- invariant states by generalizing to
the non-commutative case Kakutani's work on wandering projections. This leads
on to a classification of the structure of the local algebra O(D) by using a
'T-Twisted' equivalence relation, including a full analysis of the T-type III
case. In particular we show that O(D) is T-type III if and only if the crossed
product algebra O(D)xT is type III in the sense of Murray-von Neumann.

  coding with the SP theory of intelligence",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based coding, described by John Pierce in 1961, has great potential to
reduce the volume of information that needs to be transmitted in moving big
data, without loss of information, from one place to another, or in lossless
communications via the internet. Compared with ordinary compression methods,
this potential advantage of model-based coding in the transmission of data
arises from the fact that both the transmitter (""Alice"") and the receiver
(""Bob"") are equipped with a grammar for the kind of data that is to be
transmitted, which means that, to achieve lossless transmission of a body of
data from Alice and Bob, a relatively small amount of information needs to be
sent. Preliminary trials indicate that, with model-based coding, the volume of
information to be sent from Alice to Bob to achieve lossless transmission of a
given body of data may be less than $6\%$ of the volume of information that
needs to be sent when ordinary compression methods are used.
  Until recently, it has not been feasible to convert John Pierce's vision into
something that may be applied in practice. Now, with the development of the ""SP
theory of intelligence"" and its realisation in the ""SP computer model"", there
is clear potential to realise the three main functions that will be needed:
unsupervised learning of a grammar for the kind of data that is to be
transmitted using a relatively powerful computer that is independent of Alice
and Bob; the encoding by Alice of any one example of such data in terms of the
grammar; and, with the grammar, decoding of the encoding by Bob to retrieve the
given example. It appears now to be feasible, within reasonable timescales, to
bring these capabilities to a level where they may be applied to the
transmission of realistically large bodies of data.

keyboard strokes demonstrates distinct properties at short vs long time scales.
For instance, at long time scales, which are presumably controlled by complex
process such as planning and decision making, it has been shown that those
inter-event intervals follow a scale-invariant (or power-law) distribution. In
contrast, at shorter time-scales - which are governed by different process such
as sensorimotor skill - they do not follow the same distribution and little do
we know how they relate to the scale-invariant pattern. Here, we analyzed 9
millions intervals between smartphone screen touches of 84 individuals which
span several orders of magnitudes (from milliseconds to hours). To capture
these intervals, we extend a priority-based generative model to smartphone
touching events. At short-time scale, the model is governed by refractory
effects, while at longer time scales, the inter-touch intervals are governed by
the priority difference between smartphone tasks and other tasks. The
flexibility of the model allows to capture inter-individual variations at short
and long time scales while its tractability enables efficient model fitting.
According to our model, each individual has a specific power-low exponent which
is tightly related to the effective refractory time constant suggesting that
motor processes which influence the fast actions are related to the higher
cognitive processes governing the longer inter-event intervals.

$(0,1)$ to a certain class of locally integrable functions using a convolution
group. Our strategy is to define a fractional calculus for a certain class of
distributions using the convolution group. When acting on causal functions,
this fractional calculus agrees with the traditional Riemann-Liouville
definition for $t>0$ but includes some singularities at $t=0$ so that the group
property holds. Then, making use of this fractional calculus, we introduce the
generalized definition of Caputo derivatives. The new definition is consistent
with various definitions in literature while reveals the underlying group
structure. Since the new definition is valid for a class of locally integrable
functions that can blow up in finite time, it provides a framework for
solutions to fractional ODEs and fractional PDEs with very weak conditions. The
underlying group property makes many properties of Caputo derivatives natural.
In particular, it allows us to de-convolve the fractional differential
equations to integral equations with completely monotone kernels, which then
enables us to prove the general Gr\""onwall inequality (or comparison principle)
with the most general conditions. This then provides the essential tools for
{\it a priori} energy estimates of fractional PDEs. Some other fundamental
results for fractional ODEs are also established within this frame under very
weak conditions.

phenomenological predictions arising from Compton scattering and pair
production in a strong laser field. This theory utilizes exact solutions of
fermions embedded in external plane waves which carry over to a strong field
fermion propagator. When these strong field fermions also interact with probe
photons, the transition probability is enhanced in a series of resonances when
the kinematics allow the virtual fermion to go on-shell. An analysis of
parameters shows that contemporary experiments could already produce these
predicted resonances. With appropriate tuning, resonances can be made
arbitrarily sharp, leading to precision calculations of resonance locations and
widths, and the runing of coupling constants in strong background fields. New
tests of QED could be performed leading to ramifications for our understanding
of the quantum vacuum. Such tests extend to QFT in background potentials in
general, which may throw light on BSM theories such as QFT in curved
space-times.
