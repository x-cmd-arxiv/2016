  arXiv:1612.03087",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-quantum key distribution protocols are allowed to set up a secure secret
key between two users. Compared with their full quantum counterparts, one of
the two users is restricted to perform some ""classical"" or ""semi-quantum""
operations, which makes them easily realizable by using less quantum resource.
However, the semi-quantum key distribution protocols mainly rely on a two-way
quantum channel. The eavesdropper has two opportunities to intercept the
quantum states transmitted in the quantum communication stage. It may allow the
eavesdropper to get more information and make the security analysis more
complicated. In the past ten years, many semi-quantum key distribution
protocols have been proposed and proved to be robust. But there are few works
concerned about their unconditional security. It is doubted that how secure the
semi-quantum ones are and how much noise can they tolerate to establish a
secure secret key. In this paper, we prove the unconditional security of a
single-state semi-quantum key distribution protocol proposed by $Zou$ et al. in
[Phys. Rev. A. 79]. We present a complete proof from information theory aspect
by deriving a lower bound of the protocol's key rate in the asymptotic
scenario. Using this bound, we figure out an error threshold value such that
all error rates are less than this threshold value, the secure secret key can
be established between the legitimate users definitely. Otherwise, the users
should abort the protocol. we make an illustration of the protocol under the
circumstance of the reverse quantum channel is a depolarizing one with
parameter $q$. Additionally, we compare the error threshold value with some
full quantum protocols and several existing semi-quantum ones whose
unconditional security proofs have been provided recently.

and bright radiation in the hard X-ray regime. Due to the low wall-plug
efficiency of FEL facilities, it is crucial and additionally very useful to
develop complete and accurate simulation tools for better optimizing a FEL
interaction. The highly sophisticated dynamics involved in a FEL process was
the main obstacle hindering the development of general simulation tools for
this problem. We present a numerical algorithm based on finite difference time
domain/Particle in cell (FDTD/PIC) in a Lorentz boosted coordinate system which
is able to fulfil a full-wave simulation of a FEL process. The developed
software offers a suitable tool for the analysis of FEL interactions without
considering any of the usual approximations. A coordinate transformation to
bunch rest frame makes the very different length scales of bunch size, optical
wavelengths and the undulator period transform to values with the same order.
Consequently, FDTD/PIC simulations in conjunction with efficient
parallelization techniques make the full-wave simulation feasible using the
available computational resources. Several examples of free electron lasers are
analyzed using the developed software, the results are benchmarked based on
standard FEL codes and discussed in detail.

have discovered around one million new malware samples per quarter, and it was
reported that over 98% of these new malware samples are in fact ""derivatives""

runtime behaviors of malware's core functionalities are in fact similar within
a malware family. Hence, we propose a framework to combine ""runtime behavior""
with ""static structures"" to detect malware variants. We present the design and
implementation of MONET, which has a client and a backend server module. The
client module is a lightweight, in-device app for behavior monitoring and
signature generation, and we realize this using two novel interception
techniques. The backend server is responsible for large scale malware
detection. We collect 3723 malware samples and top 500 benign apps to carry out
extensive experiments of detecting malware variants and defending against
malware transformation. Our experiments show that MONET can achieve around 99%
accuracy in detecting malware variants. Furthermore, it can defend against 10
different obfuscation and transformation techniques, while only incurs around
7% performance overhead and about 3% battery overhead. More importantly, MONET
will automatically alert users with intrusion details so to prevent further
malicious behaviors.

mean-field theory assuming that long blocks of a copolymer are strongly
segregated, whereas short blocks are able to penetrate into ""alien"" domains and
exchange between the domains and interfacial layer. A bidisperse copolymer with
blocks of only two sizes (long and short) is considered as a model of
multiblock copolymers with high polydispersity in the block size. Short blocks
of the copolymer play an important role in microphase separation. First, their
penetration into the ""alien"" domains leads to the formation of joint long
blocks in their own domains. Second, short blocks localized at the interface
considerably change the interfacial tension. The possibility of penetration of
short blocks into the ""alien"" domains is controlled by the product chi*Nsh (chi
is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, Nsh is the short block length). At
not very large chi*Nsh, the domain size is larger than that for a regular
copolymer consisting of the same long blocks as in the considered random
copolymer. At a fixed mean block size, the domain size grows with an increase
in the block size dispersity, the rate of the growth being dependent of the
more detailed parameters of the block size distribution.

effective-temperature framework to achieve a unified description of the slow,

density of defects and the rate of configurational rearrangements, and apply
this framework to dislocations in crystalline solids and shear transformation
zones (STZs) in amorphous materials. The effective-temperature formulation
enables us to interpret the observed movement of dislocations to the ACI and
the production of STZs at the interface as a ""diffusion"" of configurational
disorder across the material. We demonstrate favorable agreement with
experimental findings reported in (Kim et al., Adv. Funct. Mater., 2011), and
demonstrate how the ACI acts as a sink of dislocations and a source of STZs.

some random real time to complete the computations necessary. This work
considers the converse: to impose a real-time budget on the computation, which
results in the number of samples simulated being random. To complicate matters,
the real time taken for each simulation may depend on the sample produced, so
that the samples themselves are not independent of their number, and a length
bias with respect to compute time is apparent. This is especially problematic
when a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used and the final state of
the Markov chain -- rather than an average over all states -- is required,
which is the case in parallel tempering implementations of MCMC. The length
bias does not diminish with the compute budget in this case. It also occurs in
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms, which is the focus of this paper. We
propose an anytime framework to address the concern, using a continuous-time
Markov jump process to study the progress of the computation in real time. We
first show that for any MCMC algorithm, the length bias of the final state's
distribution due to the imposed real-time computing budget can be eliminated by
using a multiple chain construction. The utility of this construction is then
demonstrated on a large-scale SMC^2 implementation, using four billion
particles distributed across a cluster of 128 graphics processing units on the
Amazon EC2 service. The anytime framework imposes a real-time budget on the
MCMC move steps within the SMC$^{2}$ algorithm, ensuring that all processors
are simultaneously ready for the resampling step, demonstrably reducing
idleness to due waiting times and providing substantial control over the total
compute budget.

(R$\chi$T). It is essential to give a more accurate prediction of this hadronic
contribution due to the future projects of J-Parc and FNAL on reducing the
uncertainty in this observable. We, therefore, computed the pseudoscalar
transition form factor and proposed the measurement of the
$e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-\pi^0$ cross section and dimuon invariant mass spectrum to
determine more accurately its parameters. Then, we evaluated the pion exchange
contribution to $a_\mu$, obtaining $(6.66\pm0.21)\cdot10^{-10}$. By comparing
the pion exchange contribution and the pion-pole approximation to the
corresponding transition form factor ($\pi$TFF) we recalled that the latter
underestimates the complete $\pi$TFF by (15-20)\%. Then, we obtained the
$\eta^({}'^)$ TFF, obtaining a total contribution of the lightest pseudoscalar
exchanges of $(10.47\pm0.54)\cdot10^{-10}$, in agreement with previous results
and with smaller error.

recent years since it has an important role in efficacy of railway

railway network is discussed. More specifically, a general model is presented
here in which a set of operational and safety requirements is considered. The
model handles the trains overtaking in stations and considers the stations
capacity. The objective function is to minimize the total travel time.
Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard and real size problems cannot be solved
in an acceptable amount of time. In order to reduce the processing time, we
presented some heuristic rules, which reduce the number of binary variables.
These rules are based on problem's parameters such as travel time, dwell time
and safety time of stations and try to remove the impracticable areas of the
solution space. Furthermore, a Lagrangian Relaxation algorithm model is
presented in order to find a lower-bound. Finally, comprehensive numerical
experiments on the Tehran Metro case are reported. Results show the efficiency
of the heuristic rules and also the Lagrangian Relaxation method in a way that
for all analyzed problems the optimum value are obtained.

problem. The goal is to carry out computations using confidential algorithms on
an untrusted party while ensuring confidentiality of algorithms. This problem
has been addressed for Boolean circuits known as `circuit privacy'. Circuits
corresponding to real-world programs are impractical. Well-known obfuscation
techniques are highly practicable, but provide only limited security, e.g., no
piracy protection. In this work, we modify source code yielding programs with
adjustable performance and security guarantees ranging from
indistinguishability obfuscators to (non-secure) ordinary obfuscation. The idea
is to artificially generate `misleading' statements. Their results are combined
with the outcome of a confidential statement using encrypted \emph{selector
variables}. Thus, an attacker must `guess' the encrypted selector variables to
disguise the confidential source code. We evaluated our method using more than
ten programmers as well as pattern mining across open source code repositories
to gain insights of (micro-)coding patterns that are relevant for generating
misleading statements. The evaluation reveals that our approach is effective in
that it successfully preserves source code confidentiality.

methodologies are useful for ontologists to create good ontologies, they do not
help with the task of evaluating the quality of the ontology to be reused. For
these reasons, it is imperative to evaluate the quality of the ontology after
constructing it or before reusing it. Few studies usually present only a set of
criteria and questions, but no guidelines to evaluate the ontology. The effort
to evaluate an ontology is very high as there is a huge dependence on the
evaluator's expertise to understand the criteria and questions in depth.
Moreover, the evaluation is still very subjective. This study presents a novel
methodology for ontology evaluation, taking into account three fundamental
principles: i) it is based on the Goal, Question, Metric approach for empirical
evaluation; ii) the goals of the methodologies are based on the roles of
knowledge representations combined with specific evaluation criteria; iii) each
ontology is evaluated according to the type of ontology. The methodology was
empirically evaluated using different ontologists and ontologies of the same

requirements, can be classified into two types: the standard specular

This leads to the study of no-slip billiards--planar billiard systems in which
the moving particle is a disc (with rotationally symmetric mass distribution)
whose translational and rotational velocities can both change at each collision
with the boundary of the billiard domain.
  In this paper we greatly extend previous results on boundedness of orbits
(Broomhead and Gutkin) and linear stability of periodic orbits for a Sinai-type
billiard (Wojtkowski) for no-slip billiards. We show among other facts that:
(i) for billiard domains in the plane having piecewise smooth boundary and at
least one corner of inner angle less than $\pi$, no-slip billiard dynamics will
always contain elliptic period-$2$ orbits; (ii) polygonal no-slip billiards
always admit small invariant open sets and thus cannot be ergodic with respect
to the canonical invariant billiard measure; (iii) the no-slip version of a
Sinai billiard must contain linearly stable periodic orbits of period $2$ and,
more generally, we provide a curvature threshold at which a commonly occurring

tunneling tip is formed by a Majorana bound state (MBS). This peculiar bound
state exists at the boundary of a one-dimensional topological superconductor.
Since the MBS has to be effectively spinless and local, we argue that it is the
smallest unit that shows itself odd-frequency superconducting pairing.
Odd-frequency superconductivity is characterized by an anomalous Green function
which is an odd function of the time arguments of the two electrons forming the
Cooper pair. Interestingly, our Majorana STM can be used as the perfect
detector of odd-frequency superconductivity. The reason is that a supercurrent
between the Majorana STM and any other superconductor can only flow if the
latter system exhibits itself odd-frequency pairing. To illustrate our general
idea, we consider the tunneling problem of the Majorana STM coupled to a
quantum dot in vicinity to a conventional superconductor. In such a
(superconducting) quantum dot, the effective pairing can be tuned from even- to
odd-frequency behavior if an external magnetic field is applied to it.

via their photometric light curves, because the absolute V-band magnitude for
RR Lyrae is correlated with metallicity, and the metallicity can be estimated
using a metallicity-light curve relation. To fully utilize the PTF and iPTF
light-curve data in related future work, it is necessary to derive the
metallicity-light curve relation in the native PTF/iPTF R-band photometric

topography on forced beta-plane turbulence. The forcing is a uniform steady
wind stress that produces both a uniform large-scale zonal flow $U(t)$ and
smaller-scale macroturbulence (both standing and transient eddies). The flow
$U(t)$ is retarded by Ekman drag and by the domain-averaged topographic form
stress produced by the eddies. The topographic form stress typically balances
most of the applied wind stress, while the Ekman drag provides all of the
energy dissipation required to balance the wind work. A collection of
statistically equilibrated solutions delineates the main flow regimes and the
dependence of the time-mean $U$ on the problem parameters and the statistical
properties of the topography.
  If $\beta$ is smaller than the topographic PV gradient then the flow consists
of stagnant pools attached to pockets of closed geostrophic contours. The
stagnant dead zones are bordered by jets and the flow through the domain is
concentrated into a narrow channel of open geostrophic contours.
  If $\beta$ is comparable to, or larger than, the topographic PV gradient then
all geostrophic contours are open and the flow is uniformly distributed
throughout the domain. In this case there is an ""eddy saturation"" regime in
which $U$ is insensitive to changes in the wind stress. We show that eddy
saturation requires strong transient eddies that act as PV diffusion. This PV
diffusion does not alter the energy of the standing eddies, but it does
increase the topographic form stress by enhancing the correlation between
topographic slope and the standing-eddy pressure field. Last, using bounds
based on the energy and enstrophy we show that as the wind stress increases the
flow transitions from a regime in which form stress balances the wind stress to
a regime in which the form stress is very small and large transport ensues.

solidifying multi-phase growth where the number of components exceeds the
number of solid phases becomes difficult on account of the absence of the
required number of equations to determine the boundary layer compositions ahead
of the interface. In this paper, we therefore revisit the Jackson-Hunt(JH) type
calculations for any given situation of multi-phase growth in a multi-component
system and self-consistently derive the variations of the compositions of the
solid phases as well as their volume fractions, which grow such that the
composite solid-liquid interface is isothermal. This allows us to unify the
(JH) calculation schemes for both in-variant as well as multi-variant eutectic
reactions. The derived analytical expressions are then utilized to study the
effect of dissimilar solute diffusivities and interfacial energies on the
undercoolings and the solidified fractions. We also perform phase field
simulations to confirm our theoretical predictions and find a good agreement
between our analytical calculations and model predictions for model symmetric
alloys as well as for a particular Ni-Al-Zr alloy.

uas. Under such a precision, astrometry will play important roles in detecting
and characterizing exoplanets. Specially, we can identify planet pairs in mean
motion resonances(MMRs) via astrometry, which constrains the formation and
evolution of planetary systems. In accordance with observations, we consider
two Jupiters or two super-Earths systems in 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 MMRs. Our
simulations show the false alarm probabilities(FAPs) of a third planet are
extremely small while the real two planets can be good fitted with
signal-to-noise ratio(SNR)> 3. The probability of reconstructing a resonant
system is related with the eccentricities and resonance intensity. Generally,
when SNR >= 10, if eccentricities of both planets are larger than 0.01 and the
resonance is quite strong, the probabilities to reconstruct the planet pair in
MMRs >= 80%. Jupiter pairs in MMRs are reconstructed more easily than
super-Earth pairs with similar SNR when we consider the dynamical stability.
FAPs are also calculated when we detect planet pairs in or near MMRs. FAPs for
1:2 MMR are largest, i.e., FAPs > 15% when SNR <= 10. Extrapolating from the
Kepler planet pairs near MMRs and assuming SNR to be 3, we will discover and
reconstruct a few tens of Jupiter pairs and hundreds of super-Earth pairs in
2:3 and 1:2 MMRs within 30 pc. We also compare the differences between even and
uneven data cadence and find that planets are better measured with more uniform
phase coverage.

good results, an accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to
the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage,
burst physical motion, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as those
on climate changes, sunlight changes during a day, etc. In this paper, we
propose a novel per-pixel motion descriptor for both motion detection and
dynamic texture segmentation which outperforms the current methods in the
literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based
on two complementary three-dimensional-discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) and
three-dimensional wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is
extracted for each pixel by applying a novel three dimensional wavelet-based
motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by a clustering
method such as well-known k-means algorithm or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method
compared to the other motion detection approaches from the literature. The
application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for the
different datasets are available at

The archivel
Keck/ESI spectrum and our new P200/TripleSpec spectrum reveal an absorption
line system in He I*, Ca II H\&K and Na ID. The absorption line system has a
width of $\sim$600 km/s and a blueshift velocity of $\sim$800 km/s relative to
the core of narrow emission lines, indicating an outflow. Using the Ca II
doublet, we determined that the outflowing gas covers $\sim$70\% of the
continuum. On the other hand, the HST/ACS image which taken in rest-frame 4130
\AA\ show that the fraction of the quasar emission in ESI aperture was $<$40\%.
We thus conclude that the absorbing gas covers a significant fraction of
extended starlight emission, and the best-estimated fraction of $\sim$50\%
yields a lower limit of the crosssectional area of the outflowing gas to be
$>$8 kpc$^2$. The strong Na\&Ca absorption suggests that the absorbing gas is
thick and mostly neutral, which is also supported by dust extinction
$A_V\sim3$. Using the best-estimated hydrogen column density
$N_H\sim3\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, the total mass of the outflowing gas is
$>3\times10^9 M_\odot$. The outflow is likely to be driven by AGN because of
the $\sim$800 km/s blueshift velocity, suggesting SDSS J072910.34+333634.3 is

low-rank or approximately low-rank matrix under linear constraints. In general,
this problem is combinatorial and NP-hard. In this paper, a nonconvex fraction
function is studied to approximate the rank of a matrix and translate this
NP-hard problem into a transformed affine matrix rank minimization problem. The
equivalence between these two problems is established, and we proved that the
uniqueness of the global minimizer of transformed affine matrix rank
minimization problem also solves affine matrix rank minimization problem if
some conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we also proved that the optimal
solution to the transformed affine matrix rank minimization problem can be
approximately obtained by solving its regularization problem for some proper
smaller $\lambda>0$. Lastly, the DC algorithm is utilized to solve the
regularization transformed affine matrix rank minimization problem and the
numerical experiments on image inpainting problems show that our method
performs effectively in recovering low-rank images compared with some
state-of-art algorithms.

of the whole detection system should be studied in detail. The temperature
dependence of the PSD system is mainly contributed by the three parts: the
plastic scintillator bar, the photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the Front End
Electronics (FEE). These three parts have been studied in detail and the
contribution of each part has been obtained and discussed. The temperature
coefficient of the PMT is $-0.320(\pm0.033)\%/^{\circ}$C, and the coefficient
of the plastic scintillator bar is $-0.036(\pm0.038)\%/^{\circ}$C. This result
means that after subtracting the FEE pedestal, the variation of the signal
amplitude of the PMT-scintillator system due to temperature mainly comes from
the PMT, and the plastic scintillator bar is not sensitive to temperature over
the operating range. Since the temperature effect cannot be ignored, the
temperature dependence of the whole PSD has been also studied and a correction
has been made to minimize this effect. The correction result shows that the
effect of temperature on the signal amplitude of the PSD system can be
suppressed.

flow in the left ventricle of the heart with either a mechanical or a natural
valve. Both examples have in common the two-way interaction of the flow with a
deformable interface or a membrane. The interaction potential approach (de
Tullio & Pascazio, Jou. Comp. Phys., 2016; Tanaka, Wada and Nakamura,
Computational Biomechanics, 2016) with minor modifications can be used to
capture the deformation dynamics in both classes of problems. We show that the
approach can be used to replicate the deformation dynamics of liquid-liquid
interfaces through the use of ad-hoc elastic constants. The results from our
simulations agree very well with previous studies on the deformation of drops
in standard flow configurations such as deforming drop in a shear flow or a
cross flow. We show that the same potential approach can also be used to study
the flow in the left ventricle of the heart. The flow imposed into the
ventricle interacts dynamically with the mitral valve (mechanical or natural)
and the ventricle which are simulated using the same model. Results from these
simulations are compared with ad- hoc in-house experimental measurements.
Finally, a parallelisation scheme is presented, as parallelisation is
unavoidable when studying large scale problems involving several thousands of
simultaneously deforming bodies on hundreds of distributed memory computing

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps using a new multi-phase iterative
internal-linear-combination (ILC) approach in harmonic space. The new procedure
consists of two phases. In phase 1, a diffuse foreground cleaned map is
obtained by performing a usual ILC operation in the harmonic space in a single
iteration over the desired portion of the sky. In phase 2, we obtain the final
foreground cleaned map using an iterative ILC approach also in the harmonic
space, however, now, during each iteration of foreground minimization, some of
the regions of the sky that are not being cleaned in the current iteration, are
replaced by the corresponding cleaned portions of the phase 1 cleaned map. The
new ILC method nullifies a foreground leakage signal that is otherwise
inevitably present in the old and usual harmonic space iterative ILC method.
The new method is flexible to handle input frequency maps, irrespective of
whether or not they initially have the same instrumental and pixel resolution,
by bringing them to a common and maximum possible beam and pixel resolution at
the beginning of the analysis. This dramatically reduces data redundancy and
hence memory usage and computational cost. During the ILC weight calculation it
avoids any need to deconvolve partial sky spherical harmonic coefficients by
the beam and pixel window functions, which in strict mathematical sense, is not
well-defined for azimuthally symmetric window functions. Using WMAP 9-year and
Planck-2015 published frequency maps we obtain a pair of foreground cleaned CMB
maps and CMB angular power spectrum. Our power spectrum match well with
Planck-2015 results, with some difference. Finally, we show that the weights
for ILC foreground minimization have an intrinsic characteristic that it tends
to produce a statistically isotropic CMB map as well.

complex, with multiscale models seeking to represent and bridge physiological
behaviours across temporal and spatial scales. The increasing complexity of
these models makes it computationally expensive to both evaluate long term (>60
seconds) behaviour and determine sensitivity of model outputs to inputs. This
is particularly relevant in models of atrial fibrillation (AF), where
individual episodes last from seconds to days, and inter-episode waiting times
can be minutes to months. Potential mechanisms of transition between sinus
rhythm and AF have been identified but are not well understood, and it is
difficult to simulate AF for long periods of time using state-of-the-art
models. In this study, we implemented a Moe-type cellular automaton on a novel,
topologically correct surface geometry of the left atrium. We used the model to
simulate stochastic initiation and spontaneous termination of AF, arising from
bursts of spontaneous activation near pulmonary veins. The simplified
representation of atrial electrical activity reduced computational cost, and so
permitted us to investigate AF mechanisms in a probabilistic setting. We
computed large numbers (~10^5) of sample paths of the model, to infer
stochastic initiation and termination rates of AF episodes using different
model parameters. By generating statistical distributions of model outputs, we
demonstrated how to propagate uncertainties of inputs within our microscopic
level model up to a macroscopic level. Lastly, we investigated spontaneous
termination in the model and found a complex dependence on its past AF
trajectory, the mechanism of which merits future investigation.

molecular dynamics simulations of the popular poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)

solute types with focus on aromatic model reactants. We model a PNIPAM polymer
chain and explore the influence of its elongation, stereochemistry, and
temperature on the solute binding affinities. While we find that the excess
adsorption generally raises with the size of the solute, the temperature-
dependent affinity to the chains is highly solute specific and has a
considerable dependence on the polymer elongation (i.e., polymer swelling
state). We elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the selective binding in
detail and eventually present how the results can be extrapolated to
macroscopic partitioning of the solutes in swollen polymer architectures, such

spectral algorithms. Our approach relies on replacing the orthogonality
constraints underlying those methods by unpredictability constraints.
Specifically, we require that each embedding coordinate be unpredictable (in
the statistical sense) from all previous ones. We prove that these constraints
necessarily prevent redundancy, and provide a simple technique to incorporate
them into existing methods. As we illustrate on challenging high-dimensional
scenarios, our approach produces significantly more informative and compact
representations, which improve visualization and classification tasks.

  Analysis with Parameter Tuning on Microscopy Imaging Datasets","36 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: We describe an informatics framework for researchers and clinical
investigators to efficiently perform parameter sensitivity analysis and
auto-tuning for algorithms that segment and classify image features in a large
dataset of high-resolution images. The computational cost of the sensitivity
analysis process can be very high, because the process requires processing the
input dataset several times to systematically evaluate how output varies when
input parameters are varied. Thus, high performance computing techniques are
required to quickly execute the sensitivity analysis process.
  Results: We carried out an empirical evaluation of the proposed method on
high performance computing clusters with multi-core CPUs and co-processors
(GPUs and Intel Xeon Phis). Our results show that (1) the framework achieves
excellent scalability and efficiency on a high performance computing cluster --
execution efficiency remained above 85% in all experiments; (2) the parameter
auto-tuning methods are able to converge by visiting only a small fraction
(0.0009%) of the search space with limited impact to the algorithm output
(0.56% on average).
  Conclusions: The sensitivity analysis framework provides a range of
strategies for the efficient exploration of the parameter space, as well as
multiple indexes to evaluate the effect of parameter modification to outputs or
even correlation between parameters. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of
performing sensitivity analyses, parameter studies, and auto-tuning with large
datasets with the use of high-performance systems and techniques. The proposed
technologies will enable the quantification of error estimations and output
variations in these pipelines, which may be used in application specific ways
to assess uncertainty of conclusions extracted from data generated by these
image analysis pipelines.

form a Fermi sea of weakly interacting particles at half filling $\nu=1/2$.
Recently, it was proposed (D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031027 (2015)) that these
composite fermions are Dirac particles. In our work, we demonstrate
experimentally that composite fermions found in monolayer graphene are Dirac
particles at half filling. Our experiments have addressed FQH states in
high-mobility, suspended graphene Corbino disks in the vicinity of $\nu=1/2$.
We find strong temperature dependence of conductivity $\sigma$ away from half
filling, which is consistent with the expected electron-electron interaction
induced gaps in the FQH state. At half filling, however, the temperature
dependence of conductivity $\sigma(T)$ becomes quite weak as expected for a
Fermi sea of composite fermions and we find only logarithmic dependence of
$\sigma$ on $T$. The sign of this quantum correction coincides with weak
antilocalization of composite fermions, which reveals the relativistic Dirac
nature of composite fermions in graphene.

eliminates any sign problem, and can be systematically improved upon by using

numerically exact results for the superfluid transition of hardcore bosons on

allows to construct the kinetic theory of two- and three-dimensional systems of

We demonstrate particular cases in which the derived kinetic equations have

research topic in the area of image forensics. Due to the availability of
sophisticated image editing tools and ever increasing hardware capabilities, it
has become an easy task to manipulate the digital images. Passive forgery
detection techniques are more relevant as they can be applied without the prior
information about the image in question. Block based techniques are used to
detect copy move forgery, but have limitations of large time complexity and
sensitivity against affine operations like rotation and scaling. Keypoint based
approaches are used to detect forgery in large images where the possibility of
significant post processing operations like rotation and scaling is more. A
hybrid approach is proposed using different methods for keypoint detection and
description. Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are used to detect the keypoints
in the image and Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK) features
are used to describe features at these keypoints. The proposed method has
performed better than the existing forgery detection method using SURF
significantly in terms of detection speed and is invariant to post processing
operations like rotation and scaling. The proposed method is also invariant to
other commonly applied post processing operations like adding Gaussian noise
and JPEG compression

neutron stars. In particular, we focus on the Fermi energy dependence of the
magnetic field for a relativistic electron gas in the superstrong magnetic
field of magnetars. We would like to point out that some of the results
concerning the microscopic number density of states of a strongly magnetized
electron gas given by well-known statistical physics text books are incorrect.
The repeated use of these results in the last five decades probably seriously
affects the physics of neutron stars and magnetars. The quantization of Landau
energy levels is accurately delineated in terms of the Dirac (delta) function.
Relatively simple calculation shows that the Fermi energy of relativistic
electron gas in magnetars with superstrong magnetic fields( B > Bcr , here Bcr
is the Landau critical magnetic field) increases with magnetic fieldstrength as
B**(1/4). On the basis of this simple but importantnew result we are leading
naturally to propose a new mechanism for the production of high X-ray
luminosity from magnetars.

digital ""outcome"", such as a document or source code. Our novel approach takes
the creation process into account using logged events collected by special
software or by the macro recorders found in most office applications. We look
at an author's interaction logs with the software used to create the work.
Detection relies on comparing the histograms of multiple logs' command use. A
work is classified as plagiarism if its log deviates too much from logs of
""honestly created"" works or if its log is too similar to another log. The
technique supports the detection of plagiarism for digital outcomes that stem
from \emph{unique} tasks, such as theses and \emph{equal} tasks such as
assignments for which the same problem sets are solved by multiple students.
Focusing on the latter case, we evaluate this approach using logs collected by
an interactive development environment (IDE) from more than sixty students who
completed three programming assignments.
