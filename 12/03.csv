directly coupled to an external environmental bath. The ability to engineer the
processes responsible for dissipation and coupling is fundamental to manipulate
the state of such systems. This is particularly important in oscillatory states
whose dynamic response is used for many applications, e.g. micro and
nano-mechanical resonators or sensing and timing, qubits for quantum
engineering, and vibrational modes for optomechanical devices. In situations
where stable oscillations are required, the energy dissipated by the
vibrational modes is usually compensated by replenishment from external energy
sources. Consequently, if the external energy supply is removed, the amplitude
of oscillations start to decay immediately, since there is no means to
restitute the energy dissipated. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to
maintain stable oscillations, i.e. with constant amplitude and frequency,
without supplying external energy to compensate losses. The fundamental
intrinsic mechanism of mode coupling is used to redistribute and store
mechanical energy among vibrational modes and coherently transfer it back to
the principal mode when the external excitation is off. To experimentally
demonstrate this phenomenon that defies physical intuition, we exploit the
nonlinear dynamic response of microelectromechanical (MEMS) oscillators to
couple two different vibrational modes through an internal resonance. Since the
underlying mechanism describing the fundamentals of this new phenomenon is
generic and representative of a large variety of systems, the presented method
provides a new dissipation engineering strategy that would enable a new
generation of autonomous devices.

investigation. The role of pilot case studies has not been fully addressed in
empirical software engineering research literature. Objective: To explore the
use of pilot case studies in the design of full-scale case studies, and to
report the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We
designed and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant
research variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software
engineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale case study
design for the next phase of our research. Results: The use of a pilot case
study identified several important research variables that were missing in the
initial framework. The pilot study also supported a more sophisticated case
study design, which was used to guide a full-scale study. Conclusions: When a
research topic has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to
create a case study design that covers the relevant research variables and
their potential relationships. Conducting a full-scale case study using an
untested case design can lead to waste of resources and time if the design has
to be reworked during the study. In these situations, the use of pilot case
studies can significantly improve the case study design.

any video to an image so that existing CNN models pre-trained for the analysis

thought to be fed by the continuous accretion of intergalactic gas in order to
sustain their star-formation activity. However, direct observational evidence
for this accretion phenomenon has been elusive. Theoretically, the accreted gas
coming from the intergalactic medium is expected to orbit about the halo,
delivering not just fuel for star-formation but also angular momentum to the
galaxy. This accreting material is thus expected to form a gaseous structure
that should be co-rotating with the host once at $r<0.3\;R_{\rm vir}$ or

  homodyne readout for future gravitational waves detectors",,"Phys. Rev. D 95, 062001 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevD.95.062001",,"gr-qc quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the recent discovery of Gravitational waves, marking the start of the
new field of GW astronomy, the push for building more sensitive
laser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWD) has never been
stronger. Balanced homodyne detection (BHD) allows for a quantum noise limited
readout of arbitrary light field quadratures, and has therefore been suggested
as a vital building block for upgrades to Advanced LIGO and third generation
observatories. In terms of the practical implementation of BHD, we develop a
full framework for analyzing the static optical high order modes (HOMs)
occurring in the BHD paths related to the misalignment or mode matching at the
input and output ports of the laser interferometer. We find the effects of HOMs
on the quantum noise limited sensitivity is independent of the actual
interferometer configuration, e.g. Michelson and Sagnac interferometers are
effected in the same way. We show that output misalignment only effects the
high frequency part of the quantum noise limited sensitivity. However, at low
frequencies, HOMs reduce the interferometer response and the radiation pressure
noise by the same amount and hence the quantum noise limited sensitivity is not
negatively effected. We show that the input misalignment to the interferometer
produces the same effect as output misalignment and additionally decreases the
power inside the interferometer. We also analyze dynamic HOM effects, such as
beam jitter created by the suspended mirrors of the BHD. Our analyses can be
directly applied to any BHD implementation in a future GWD. Moreover, we apply
our analytical techniques to the example of the speed meter proof of concept
experiment under construction in Glasgow. We find that for our experimental
parameters, the performance of our seismic isolation system in the BHD paths is
compatible with the design sensitivity of the experiment.

process (CTMDP) with a lower bounding function. In this model, the negative
part of each cost rate is bounded by the drift function, say $w$, whereas the
positive part is allowed to be arbitrarily unbounded. Our focus is on the
existence of a stationary optimal policy for the discounted CTMDP problems out
of the more general class. Both constrained and unconstrained problems are
considered. Our investigations are based on a useful transformation for
nonhomogeneous Markov pure jump processes that has not yet been widely applied
to the study of CTMDPs. This technique was not employed in previous literature,
but it clarifies the roles of the imposed conditions in a rather transparent
way. As a consequence, we withdraw and weaken several conditions commonly
imposed in the literature.

limited contexts the required number of training samples can be low and
self-improvement of pre-trained networks in more general context is possible.
We argue that the combination of sparse outlier detection with deep components

important requirement for engineering applications. We argue that supervised
learning of labels may be fully eliminated under certain conditions: a
component based architecture together with a knowledge based system can train
itself and provide high quality answers. We demonstrate these concepts on the

several tasks in quantum technology, including quantum search algorithms and
universal quantum computation. In order to design and implement CTQWs in a
realistic scenario, one needs effective simulation tools for Hamiltonians that
take into account static noise and fluctuations in the lattice, i.e.
Hamiltonians containing stochastic terms. To this aim, we suggest a parallel
algorithm based on the Taylor series expansion of the evolution operator, and
compare its performances with those of algorithms based on the exact
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian or a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration. We
prove that both Taylor-series expansion and Runge-Kutta algorithms are reliable
and have a low computational cost, the Taylor-series expansion showing the
additional advantage of a memory allocation not depending on the precision of
calculation. Both algorithms are also highly parallelizable within the SIMT
paradigm, and are thus suitable for GPGPU computing. In turn, we have
benchmarked 4 NVIDIA GPUs and 3 quad-core Intel CPUs for a 2-particle system
over lattices of increasing dimension, showing that the speedup providend by
GPU computing, with respect to the OPENMP parallelization, lies in the range
between 8x and (more than) 20x, depending on the frequency of post-processing.
GPU-accelerated codes thus allow one to overcome concerns about the execution
time, and make it possible simulations with many interacting particles on large
lattices, with the only limit of the memory available on the device.

magnetic interactions in systems (e.g., {\alpha}-RuCl3) with non-negligible

scheme, we put forward a minimal J1-K1-{\Gamma}1-J3-K3 model for {\alpha}-RuCl3

interaction J3 stabilizes the zigzag antiferromagnetic order; (II) The NN

the preferred direction of magnetic moments and generating the spin wave gap.
Exact diagonalization study on this model shows that the Kitaev QSL can be
realized by suppressing the NN symmetric off-diagonal exchange {\Gamma}1 and
the third NN Heisenberg interaction J3. Thus, we not only propose a powerful
general scheme for investigating the intriguing magnetism of Jeff=1/2 magnets,

an arbitrary diagram D of a link without a trivial split component, a minimal
diagram obtained by applying Reidemeister moves I and II to D is unique. The

neutrinos through the Earth matter and how it affects the hierarchy sensitivity
of the DUNE experiment. We emphasize on the special case when the diagonal NSI
parameter $\epsilon_{ee} = -1$, nullifying the standard matter effect. We show
that, if in addition, CP violation is maximal then this gives rise to an exact
intrinsic hierarchy degeneracy in the appearance channel, irrespective of the
baseline and energy. Introduction of off-diagonal NSI parameter, $\epsilon_{e
\tau}$, shifts the position of this degeneracy to a different $\epsilon_{ee}$.
Moreover the unknown magnitude and phases of the off-diagonal NSI parameters
can give rise to additional degeneracies. Overall, given the current model
independent limits on NSI parameters, the hierarchy sensitivity of DUNE can get
seriously impacted. However, a more precise knowledge on the NSI parameters,
specially $\epsilon_{ee}$, can give rise to an improved sensitivity.
Alternatively, if NSI exists in nature, and still DUNE shows hierarchy
sensitivity, certain ranges of the NSI parameters can be excluded.
Additionally, we briefly discussed the implications of $\epsilon_{ee} = -1$ (in
the Earth) on MSW effect in the Sun.

goal is to discuss predictions from theoretical models, but particular emphasis

of observational confirmation, a rich and tantalizing new phenomenology of
relationships between $M_*$, $Z$, SFR, and gas fraction is emerging both in
observations and in theoretical models. A consensus interpretation is emerging
in which star-forming galaxies do most of their growing in a quiescent way that
balances gas inflows and gas processing, and metal dilution with enrichment.
Models that explicitly invoke this idea via equilibrium conditions can be used
to infer inflow rates from observations, while models that do not assume
equilibrium growth tend to recover it self-consistently. Mergers are an overall
subdominant mechanism for delivering fresh gas to galaxies, but they trigger
radial flows of previously-accreted gas that flatten radial gas-phase
metallicity gradients and temporarily suppress central metallicities. Radial
gradients are generically expected to be steep at early times and then
flattened by mergers and enriched inflows of recycled gas at late times.
However, further theoretical work is required in order to understand how to
interpret observations. Likewise, more observational work is needed in order to
understand how metallicity gradients evolve to high redshifts.

sensitive to the infall of cool material at temperatures ~ 100-10,000 K
anywhere along the line of sight to a galaxy's stellar component. However,
secure detections of this redshifted absorption signature have proved
challenging to obtain due to the ubiquity of cool gas outflows giving rise to
blueshifted absorption along the same sightlines. In this chapter, we review
the bona fide detections of this phenomenon. Analysis of NaI D line profiles

interpolate between Poisson and GUE/Ginibre statistics in dimension 1 or 2.
These processes are obtained by performing an independent Bernoulli percolation
on the particle configuration of of a log-gas confined in a general potential.
We show that, depending on the expected number of deleted particles, there is a
universal transition for mesoscopic statistics. Namely, at small scales, the
point process still behaves according to random matrix theory, while, at large
scales, it needs to be renormalized because the variance of any linear
statistic diverges. The crossover is explicitly characterized as the
superposition of a H^{1/2}- or H^1- correlated Gaussian noise and an
independent Poisson process. The proof consists in computing the limits of the
cumulants of linear statistics using the asymptotics of the correlation kernel
of the process.

low arithmetic complexity are presented. The new transforms are proposed based
on pruning state-of-the-art DCT approximations. The proposed algorithms were
assessed in terms of arithmetic complexity, energy retention capability, and
image compression performance. In addition, a metric combining performance and
computational complexity measures was proposed. Results showed good performance
and extremely low computational complexity. Introduced algorithms were mapped
into systolic-array digital architectures and physically realized as digital
prototype circuits using FPGA technology and mapped to 45nm CMOS technology.
All hardware-related metrics showed low resource consumption of the proposed
pruned approximate transforms. The best proposed transform according to the
introduced metric presents a reduction in power consumption of 21--25%.

structured reservoir of frequency modes or a thermal bath, with Ohmic-like
spectral density (SD). It is known that non-Markovian evolution appears
uniquely above a temperature-dependent critical value of the Ohmicity
parameter, and non-Markovianity can be induced by properly engineering the
external environment. In the same scenario, we find that the flow of quantum
information shows regular patterns: alternate directions appear in
correspondence of periodical intervals of the Ohmicity parameter $\alpha_0$.
The information flows back into the system over long times for
$2+4n<\alpha_0<4+4n$, at zero temperature, and for $3+4n<\alpha_0<5+4n$, at
non-vanishing temperatures, where $n=0,1,2,\ldots$. Otherwise, the long time
information flows into the environment. In the transition from vanishing to
arbitrary non-vanishing temperature, the long time back-flow of information is
stable for $3+4n<\alpha_0<4+4n$, while it is reverted for $2+4n<\alpha_0<3+4n$
and $4+4n<\alpha_0<5+4n$. The patterns of the information flow are not altered
if the low frequency Ohmic-like profiles of the SDs are perturbed with
additional factors that consist in arbitrary powers of logarithmic forms.
Consequently, the flow of information can be controlled, directed and reverted
over long times by engineering a wide variety of reservoirs that includes and
continuously departs from the Ohmic-like structure at low frequencies.
Non-Markovianity and recoherence appear according to the same rules along with
the back-flow of information.

rate of demagnetization is also reflected in the growth rate of the s-wave
contact, observed using time-resolved spectroscopy. At unitarity, the contact
rises to $0.28(3) k_F^2$ per particle, measuring the breaking of scaling
symmetry. Our observations support the conjecture that in systems with strong

is, given input-output examples, synthesize source code that maps inputs to
corresponding outputs. Our key contribution is TerpreT, a domain-specific
language for expressing program synthesis problems. A TerpreT model is composed
of a specification of a program representation and an interpreter that
describes how programs map inputs to outputs. The inference task is to observe
a set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. From a TerpreT
model we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends:
gradient descent (thus each TerpreT model can be seen as defining a
differentiable interpreter), linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical
models, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis
system. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a
range of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it
separates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing proper
comparisons between different approaches to inference.
  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models
and performing an extensive empirical comparison between alternative inference
algorithms on a variety of program models. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to compare gradient-based search over program space to traditional
search-based alternatives. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers
dominate the gradient descent and LP-based formulations.

growth and determine the share of each of the economic growth sources in the
mining sector of Iran. The time period of this study is 1355-1385 of the Solar
Hijri calendar (roughly overlaying with the time period of 1976-2006 of the
Gregorian calendar). In this paper, the shares of total factor productivity
growth (TFPG) and factors' accumulations in the economic growth of the mining
sector are estimated using a neoclassical growth accounting approach. Based on
the estimated restricted Cobb-Douglas production function and the results
obtained from the Solow residual equation, the annual growth rates of TFP were
measured for each year. According to the findings, the average annual growth
rate of TFP has been 2.94% during the time period of the present study. The
other findings of this study indicate that the average contributions of TFPG,
labor accumulation and capital accumulation in the economic growth of the
mining sector have been 56%, 23%, and 21%, respectively, during the time period
of the study. As such, it can be concluded that the policy of benefiting from
available factors in the mining sector together with the policy of accumulating
factors have simultaneously caused the value-added growth of this sector.
Therefore, considering the desired performance of the mining sector in terms of
its sizable productivity growth, it can be argued that the mining sector can
aid Iran's economic development plans to achieve their assigned economic
objectives, one of which is to increase the share of total factor productivity
growth in economic growth.

allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for

allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to
recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can
generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The
architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.

importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of
applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in
our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities,
resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated
sense of their capability.
  We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance
the popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that every
question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image,
but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the
question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA
dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our
complete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part of
the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA
v2.0).
  We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced
dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset,
suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors.
This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to
be a qualitative sense among practitioners.
  Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images
enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to
providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a
counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is
similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the
same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.

and quasar surveys, based on a data driven model of latent spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and a physical model of photometric fluxes as a function
of redshift. This conceptually novel approach combines the advantages of both
machine-learning and template-fitting methods by building template SEDs
directly from the training data. This is made computationally tractable with
Gaussian Processes operating in flux--redshift space, encoding the physics of
redshift and the projection of galaxy SEDs onto photometric band passes. This
method alleviates the need of acquiring representative training data or
constructing detailed galaxy SED models; it requires only that the photometric
band passes and calibrations be known or have parameterized unknowns. The
training data can consist of a combination of spectroscopic and deep many-band
photometric data, which do not need to entirely spatially overlap with the
target survey of interest or even involve the same photometric bands. We
showcase the method on the $i$-magnitude-selected, spectroscopically-confirmed
galaxies in the COSMOS field. The model is trained on the deepest bands (from
SUBARU and HST) and photometric redshifts are derived using the shallower SDSS
optical bands only. We demonstrate that we obtain accurate redshift point
estimates and probability distributions despite the training and target sets
having very different redshift distributions, noise properties, and even
photometric bands. Our model can also be used to predict missing photometric
fluxes, or to simulate populations of galaxies with realistic fluxes and
redshifts, for example. This method opens a new era in which photometric
redshifts for large photometric surveys are derived using a flexible yet
physical model of the data trained on all available surveys (spectroscopic and
photometric).

excellent opportunity to use absorption spectroscopy to study the planet
forming environment. Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) instrument on
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) we observe the most abundant element in the

new technique to decrease the contamination of the Ly-\alpha\ line by
geocoronal airglow in COS spectra. This Airglow Virtual Motion (AVM) technique
allows us to shift the Ly-\alpha\ line of the astrophysical target away from
the contaminating airglow emission revealing more of the astrophysical line
profile. The column density of hydrogen in the \beta\ Pic stable gas disk at
the stellar radial velocity is measured to be $\log(N_{\mathrm{H}}/1
\mathrm{cm}^2) \ll 18.5$. The Ly-\alpha\ emission line profile is found to be
asymmetric and we propose that this is caused by HI falling in towards the star
with a bulk radial velocity of $41\pm6$ km/s relative to \beta\ Pic and a
column density of $\log(N_{\mathrm{H}}/1 \mathrm{cm}^2) = 18.6\pm0.1$. The high
column density of hydrogen relative to the hydrogen content of CI chondrite
meteorites indicates that the bulk of the hydrogen gas does not come from the
dust in the disk. This column density reveals a hydrogen abundance much lower
than solar, which excludes the possibility that the detected hydrogen could be
a remnant of the protoplanetary disk or gas expelled by the star. We
hypothesise that the hydrogen gas observed falling towards the star arises from
the dissociation of water originating from evaporating exocomets.

parameters is necessary for upcoming galaxy surveys. Because WL probes
structures in the non-linear regime, analytical forward modeling is very
challenging, if not impossible. Numerical simulations of WL features rely on
ray-tracing through the outputs of $N$-body simulations, which requires
knowledge of the gravitational potential and accurate solvers for light ray
trajectories. A less accurate procedure, based on the Born approximation, only
requires knowledge of the density field, and can be implemented more
efficiently and at a lower computational cost. In this work, we use simulations
to show that deviations of the Born-approximated convergence power spectrum,
skewness and kurtosis from their fully ray--traced counterparts are consistent
with the smallest non-trivial $O(\Phi^3)$ post-Born corrections (so-called
geodesic and lens-lens terms). Our results imply a cancellation among the
larger $O(\Phi^4)$ (and higher order) terms, consistent with previous analytic
work. We also find that cosmological parameter bias induced by the Born
approximated power spectrum is negligible even for an LSST-like survey, once
galaxy shape noise is considered. When considering higher order statistics such
as the $\kappa$ skewness and kurtosis, however, we find significant bias of up
to 2.5$\sigma$. Using the LensTools software suite, we show that the Born
approximation saves a factor of 4 in computing time with respect to the full
ray-tracing in reconstructing the convergence.

Momentum relaxation, present in any realistic electron liquid, resolves the

travelling time between the two connection points needs to be taken into
account. Therefore, we treat the transmon qubit as a giant atom with a
deterministic time delay. We find that the spontaneous emission of the system,
formed by the giant atom and the SAWs between its connection points, initially
decays polynomially in the form of pulses instead of a continuous exponential
decay behaviour, as would be the case for a small atom. We obtain exact
analytical results for the scattering properties of the giant atom up to
two-phonon processes by using a diagrammatic approach. We find that two peaks
appear in the inelastic (incoherent) power spectrum of the giant atom, a
phenomenon which does not exist for a small atom. The time delay also gives
rise to novel features in the reflectance, transmittance, and second-order
correlation functions of the system. Furthermore, we find the short-time

method for open quantum systems with a finite-time-delay feedback loop.

improved estimates can be obtained by the use of higher order piecewise tensor

to accurate and precise constraints for the incidence of cool gas in massive

using helioseismology techniques and found to be a complex function of
co-latitude, {\theta}, and radius, r. From helioseismology and observations of
apparently ""rooted"" solar magnetic tracers we know that the surface rotates
more slowly than much of the interior. The cause of this slow-down is not
understood but it is important for understanding stellar rotation generally and
any plausible theory of the solar interior. A new analysis using 5-min solar
p-mode limb oscillations as a rotation ""tracer"" finds an even larger velocity
gradient in a thin region at the top of the photosphere. This shear occurs
where the solar atmosphere radiates energy and angular momentum. We suggest
that the net effect of the photospheric angular momentum loss is similar to
Poynting-Robertson ""photon braking"" on, for example, Sun-orbiting dust. The
resultant photospheric torque is readily computed and, over the Sun's lifetime,
is found to be comparable to the apparent angular momentum deficit in the
near-surface shear layer.

therefore weakly ionized. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
is thought to be mostly absent, and another mechanism has to be found to
explain gas accretion. It has been proposed that magnetized winds, launched
from the ionized disk surface, could drive accretion in the presence of a
large-scale magnetic field. The efficiency and the impact of these surface
winds on the disk structure is still highly uncertain. We present the first
global simulations of a weakly ionized disk that exhibits large-scale
magnetized winds. We also study the impact of self-organization, which was
previously demonstrated only in non-stratified models. We perform numerical
simulations of stratified disks with the PLUTO code. We compute the ionization
fraction dynamically, and account for all three non-ideal MHD effects: ohmic
and ambipolar diffusions, and the Hall drift. Simplified heating and cooling
due to non-thermal radiation is also taken into account in the disk atmosphere.
We find that disks can be accreting or not, depending on the configuration of
the large-scale magnetic field. Magnetothermal winds, driven both by magnetic
acceleration and heating of the atmosphere, are obtained in the accreting case.
In some cases, these winds are asymmetric, ejecting predominantly on one side
of the disk. The wind mass loss rate depends primarily on the average ratio of
magnetic to thermal pressure in the disk midplane. The non-accreting case is
characterized by a meridional circulation, with accretion layers at the disk
surface and decretion in the midplane. Finally, we observe self-organization,
resulting in axisymmetric rings of density and associated pressure ""bumps"". The
underlying mechanism and its impact on observable structures are discussed.

is influenced by the presence of colloidal inclusions and, in turn, layers'
undulations mediate the spatial patterning of particle locations. We find that
the bending of cholesteric layers around a colloidal particle surface prompts
the local nucleation of an undulations lattice at electric fields below the
well-defined threshold known for liquid crystals without inclusions, and that
the onset of the resulting lattice is locally influenced, both dimensionally
and orientationally, by the initial arrangements of colloids defined using
laser tweezers. Spherical particles tend to spatially localize in the regions
of strong distortions of the cholesteric layers, while colloidal nanowires
exhibit an additional preference for multistable alignment offset along various
vectors of the undulations lattice. Magnetic rotation of superparamagnetic
colloidal particles couples with the locally distorted helical axis and
undulating cholesteric layers in a manner that allows for a controlled

reduction in both arithmetic operations and storage memory. Several techniques
have been proposed for reducing or compressing the parameters for feed-forward

parameter compression on recurrent neural networks (RNN). In particular, the
extent to which the recurrent parameters can be compressed and the impact on
short-term memory performance, is not well understood. In this paper, we study
the effect of complexity reduction, through singular value decomposition rank
reduction, on RNN and minimal gated recurrent unit (MGRU) networks for several

perturbation model for the effect of general perturbations, such as a
compression, on the recurrent parameters of RNNs. The model is tested against a
noiseless memorization experiment that elucidates the short-term memory
performance. In this way, we demonstrate that the effect of compression of

a new clustering paradigm termed motif clustering. Unlike classical clustering,
motif clustering aims to minimize the number of clustering errors associated

two-fold: We first introduce motif correlation clustering, in which the goal is
to agnostically partition the vertices of a weighted complete graph so that
certain predetermined ""important"" social subgraphs mostly lie within the same
cluster, while ""less relevant"" social subgraphs are allowed to lie across
clusters. We then proceed to introduce the notion of motif covers, in which the
goal is to cover the vertices of motifs via the smallest number of (near)
cliques in the graph. Motif cover algorithms provide a natural solution for
overlapping clustering and they also play an important role in latent feature
inference of networks. For both motif correlation clustering and its extension
introduced via the covering problem, we provide hardness results, algorithmic
solutions and community detection results for two well-studied social networks.

for new transient surveys, particularly those aimed at detecting fast radio

critical, statistical questions relevant for current transient and FRB research
and utilizing the negative binomial model for counts in which the count rate
parameter is uncertain or randomly biased from one study to the next. We apply
these methods to re-assess and update results from previous FRB surveys,
finding as follows. 1) Thirteen FRBs detected across five
high-Galactic-latitude (> 30$^\circ$) surveys are highly significant $(p =
5\times 10^{-5})$ evidence of a higher rate relative to the single FRB detected
across four low-latitude (< 5$^\circ$) surveys, even after accounting for
effects that dampen Galactic plane sensitivity. High- vs. mid-latitude (5 to
15$^\circ$) is marginally significant $(p = 0.03)$. 2) A meta analysis of
twelve heterogeneous surveys gives an FRB rate of 2866 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$
above 1 Jy at high Galactic latitude (95% confidence 1121 to 7328) and 285
sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at low/mid latitudes (95% from 48 to 1701). 3) Using the
Parkes HTRU high-latitude setup requires 193 observing hours to achieve 50%
probability of detecting an FRB and 937 hours to achieve 95% probability, based
on the ten detections of (Champion et al. 2016) and appropriately accounting
for uncertainty in the unknown Poisson rate. 4) Two quick detections at Parkes
from a small number of high-latitude fields (Ravi et al. 2015; Petroff et al.

by general estimating equations, when data are missing at random. The
efficiency of existing estimators depends critically on correctly specifying
the conditional expectation of the estimating function given the observed
components of the random observations. When the conditional expectation is not
correctly specified, the efficiency of estimation can be severely compromised
even if the propensity function (of missingness) is correctly specified. We
propose an efficient estimator which enjoys the double-robustness property and
can achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound within the class of the
estimating functions that are generated by the estimating function of
estimating equations, if both the propensity model and the regression model (of
the conditional expectation) are specified correctly. Moreover, if the
propensity model is specified correctly but the regression model is
misspecified, the proposed estimator still achieves a semiparametric efficiency
lower bound within a more general class of estimating functions. Simulation
results suggest that the proposed estimators are robust against
misspecification of the propensity model or regression model and outperform
many existing competitors in the sense of having smaller mean-square errors.
Moreover, using our approach for statistical inference requires neither
resampling nor kernel smoothing. A real data example is used to illustrate the
proposed approach.

$\mathbb{F}[G]$ whose supports have size $3$. For any field $\mathbb{F}$ and
all torsion-free groups $G$, we prove that if $\alpha \beta=0$ for some
non-zero $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}[G]$ such that $|supp(\alpha)|=3$, then
$|supp(\beta)|\geq 10$. If $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_2$ is the field with 2
elements, the latter result can be improved so that $|supp(\beta)|\geq 20$.
This improves a result in [J. Group Theory, 16 (2013), no. 5, 667-693].
Concerning the unit conjecture, we prove that if $\alpha \beta=1$ for some
$\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}[G]$ such that $|supp(\alpha)|=3$, then
$|supp(\beta)|\geq 9$. The latter improves a part of a result in [Exp. Math.,
24 (2015), 326-338] to arbitrary fields.

heterogeneous physical agents consisting of single-integrator,
double-integrator and Euler-Lagrange dynamics. Here, the goal is that each
agent uses local information and local interaction to calculate the average of
individual time-varying reference inputs, one per agent. Two nonsmooth
algorithms are proposed to achieve the distributed average tracking goal. In
our first proposed algorithm, each agent tracks the average of the reference
inputs, where each agent is required to have access to only its own position
and the relative positions between itself and its neighbors. To relax the
restrictive assumption on admissible reference inputs, we propose the second
algorithm. A filter is introduced for each agent to generate an estimation of
the average of the reference inputs. Then, each agent tracks its own generated
signal to achieve the average tracking goal in a distributed manner. Finally,
numerical example is included for illustration.

pre-processing step for analytic procedures and subsequent inferences about
longitudinal tissue changes. Manual segmentation defines the current gold
standard in quality but is prohibitively expensive. Automatic approaches are
computationally intensive, incredibly slow at scale, and error prone due to
usually involving many potentially faulty intermediate steps. In order to
streamline the segmentation, we introduce a deep learning model that is based
on volumetric dilated convolutions, subsequently reducing both processing time
and errors. Compared to its competitors, the model has a reduced set of
parameters and thus is easier to train and much faster to execute. The contrast
in performance between the dilated network and its competitors becomes obvious
when both are tested on a large dataset of unprocessed human brain volumes. The
dilated network consistently outperforms not only another state-of-the-art deep
learning approach, the up convolutional network, but also the ground truth on
which it was trained. Not only can the incredible speed of our model make large
scale analyses much easier but we also believe it has great potential in a
clinical setting where, with little to no substantial delay, a patient and
provider can go over test results.

region of NGC 1068 to study the physical and chemical properties of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) and to test whether these GMC-scale properties are
linked to the larger-scale galactic environment. Using the derived $^{13}$CO
cube, we have identified 187 high-significance ($> 8\sigma$) GMCs by employing
the CLUMPFIND algorithm. The molecular gas masses of GMCs $M_{\rm ^{13}CO}$,
derived from the $^{13}$CO data, range from $1.8 \times 10^4 ~ M_\odot$ to $4.2
\times 10^7 ~M_\odot$.
  A mass function of GMCs in NGC 1068 has been obtained for the first time at
$\sim$100 pc resolution. We find the slope of the mass function $\gamma = -1.25
\pm 0.07$ for a mass range of $M_{\rm ^{13}CO} \geq 10^5M_\odot$. This is
shallower than the GMCs in the disk regions of the Milky Way, M51 and NGC 300.
Further, we find that the high mass cut-off of the GMC mass function occurs at
$M_{\rm ^{13}CO} \sim 6 \times 10^7 M_\odot$, which is an order of magnitude
larger than that in the nuclear bar region of M51, indicating that the more
massive clouds dominate the mass budget in NGC 1068. The observed
C$^{18}$O)/$^{13}$CO intensity ratios are found to be fairly uniform (0.27
$\pm$ 0.05) among the identified GMCs. In contrast, the CH$_3$OH/$^{13}$CO
ratios exhibit striking spatial variation across the disk, with the smallest
values around the bar-end ($<$ 0.03), and larger ratios along the spiral arms
($\sim$ 0.1-0.2). We find that GMCs with detectable methanol emission tend to
have systematically larger velocity widths than those without methanol
emission, suggesting that (relatively weak) shocks are responsible for the
enhancement of the CH$_3$OH/$^{13}$CO ratios of GMCs in the disk of NGC 1068.

However, key questions still exist concerning the relationship between the

impact this scaling. We show that the broadband spectra of A0620-00

model where the jet power and all distances are scaled by the black hole mass.
We find we can explain the data of both A0620-00 and~\sgra~(in its non-thermal
flaring state) in the context of two outflow-model scenarios: (1) a
synchrotron-self-Compton dominated state in which the jet plasma reaches highly
sub-equipartition conditions (for the magnetic field with respect to that of
the radiating particles), and (2) a synchrotron dominated state in the
fast-cooling regime in which particle acceleration occurs within the inner few
gravitational radii of the black hole and plasma is close to equipartition. We
show that it may be possible to further discriminate between models (1) and (2)

five thousand fine particles were defined along the box by using a random

fine particles, we take into account both the contact forces and the long-range
dispersive forces. We account for normal and static/sliding tangential friction
forces between particles and between particle and wall by means of a linear
model approach, while the long-range dispersive forces are computed by using a
Lennard-Jones like potential. The packing processes were studied assuming
different long- range interaction strengths. We carry out statistical
calculations of the different quantities studied such as packing density, mean
coordination number and time derivative of the kinetic energy as the system
evolves over time. A size spectral analysis was employed to obtain the radial
distribution function (RDF) of the random close-packed structures (RCPS) for
the case of random size particles. We find that the long-range dispersive
forces can strongly influence the packing process dynamics as they might form
large particle clusters, depending on the intensity of the long-range

seen to be more influenced by the hardness of the particles than by the

The accretion flow in these cases is interrupted at the magnetospheric radius
and then reaches the surface of a neutron star following magnetic field lines.
Accreting matter moving along magnetic field lines forms the accretion envelope
around the central object. We show that, in case of high mass accretion rates
$\gtrsim 10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$ the envelope becomes closed and optically
thick, which influences the dynamics of the accretion flow and the
observational manifestation of the neutron star hidden behind the envelope.
Particularly, the optically thick accretion envelope results in a multi-color
black-body spectrum originating from the magnetospheric surface. The spectrum
and photon energy flux vary with the viewing angle, which gives rise to
pulsations characterized by high pulsed fraction and typically smooth pulse
profiles. The reprocessing of radiation due to interaction with the envelope
leads to the disappearance of cyclotron scattering features from the spectrum.
We speculate that the super-orbital variability of ultra-luminous X-ray sources

Dependency Graphs (UDGs), which provides a compact representation of the
dependencies between units of numbers mentioned in a given problem. Inducing
the UDG alleviates the brittleness of the unit extraction system and allows for
a natural way to leverage domain knowledge about unit compatibility, for word
problem solving. We introduce a decomposed model for inducing UDGs with minimal
additional annotations, and use it to augment the expressions used in the
arithmetic word problem solver of (Roy and Roth 2015) via a constrained

word problems. In addition, it also makes the system more robust to adaptation

potentials. In particular, we consider one-dimensional quasiperiodic models
with single-particle mobility edges. Although a conventional perspective
suggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized
states in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems
can display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the
delocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or
topology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting
incommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and
fully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically
and remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for
a certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.
metallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law
scaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of
ergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity
in a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle
delocalized states is closely related to the so-called ""many-body proximity
effect"" and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems
with delocalized degrees of freedom. Many-body localization in systems with
incommensurate potentials (without single-particle mobility edges) have been
realized experimentally, and we show how this can be modified to study the the
effects of such mobility edges. Demonstrating the failure of thermalization in
the presence of a single-particle mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit
would indicate a more robust violation of the ETH.

Glacier dynamics are driven by the interplay between the topography,
temperature and basal conditions beneath the ice. A glacier dynamics model
describes the interactions between these processes. We develop a hierarchical
Bayesian model that integrates multiple ice sheet surface data sets with a

of real numbers. The set of conditions is a partition in some algebra of
events. The expected value of an act can be calculated when a probability
measure is given. We adopt an algebraic point of view by substituting the
algebra of events with a finite distributive lattice and the probability
measure with a lattice valuation. We introduce a partial order on acts that
generalizes the dominance relation and show that the set of acts is a lattice
with respect to this order. Finally we analyze some different kinds of
comparison between acts, without supposing a common set of conditions for the
acts to be compared.

  proof","12page, 3figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1612.03170",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) can share secret keys by using less
quantum resource than its fully quantum counterparts, and this likely makes
SQKD become more practical and realizable. In this paper, we present a new SQKD
protocol by introducing the idea of B92 into semi-quantum key distribution and
prove its unconditional security. In this protocol, the sender Alice just sends
one qubit to the classical Bob and Bob just prepares one state in the
preparation process. Indeed the classical user's measurement is not necessary
either. This protocol can reduce some quantum communication and make it easier
to be implemented. It can be seen as the semi-quantum version of B92 protocol,
comparing to the protocol BKM2007 as the semi-quantum version of BB84 in fully
quantum cryptography. We verify it has higher key rate and therefore is more
efficient. Specifically we prove it is unconditionally secure by computing a
lower bound of the key rate in the asymptotic scenario from information theory
aspect. Then we can find a threshold value of errors such that for all error
rates less than this value, the secure key can be established between the
legitimate users definitely. We make an illustration of how to compute the
threshold value in case of the reverse channel is a depolarizing one with
parameter $p$. Though the threshold value is a little smaller than those of
some existed SQKD protocols, it can be comparable to the B92 protocol in fully
quantum cryptography.

entanglement has been presented recently by Tian et al. It is said that the
scheme's unconditional security is guaranteed by adopting quantum key
preparation, quantum encryption algorithm and quantum entanglement. In this
paper, we prove that each signatory can get the signed message just by an
intercept-resend attack. Then, we show there still exists some participant
attacks and external attacks. Specifically, we verify the message sender Alice
can impersonate each signatory to sign the message at will, and so is the
signature collector Charlie. Also, we demonstrate that the receiver Bob can
forge the signature successfully, and with respect to the external attacks, the
eavesdropper Eve can modify the signature at random. Besides, we discover Eve
can change the signed message at will, and Eve can impersonate Alice as the
message sender without being discovered. In particular, we propose an improved
scheme based on the original one and show that it is secure against not only
the attacks mentioned above but also some collusion attacks.

regularization approximates scalar-field-only quantum-field-theory amplitudes.
The construction does not require fractals to be Lorentz-invariant in any
sense, and we argue that there probably is no Lorentz-invariant fractal of
dimension greater than 2. We derive dimensional regularization's power-law
screening first for fractals obtained by removing voids from 3-dimensional
Euclidean space. The derivation applies techniques from elementary dielectric
theory. Surprisingly, fractal geometry by itself does not guarantee the
appropriate power-law behavior; boundary conditions at fractal voids also play
an important role. We then extend the derivation to 4-dimensional Minkowski
space. We comment on generalization to nonscalar fields, and speculate about
implications for quantum gravity.

intentional generation, promotion, and realization of new ideas for the benefit
of individual performance, group effectiveness, or the organization. The
literature classifies this phenomenon as innovative behaviour. Despite its
importance to the development of innovation, innovative behaviour has not been
fully investigated in software engineering. Objective: To understand the
factors that support or inhibit innovative behaviour in software engineering
practice. Method: We conducted a pilot case study in a Canadian software
company using interviews and observations as data collection techniques. Using
qualitative analysis, we identified relevant factors and relationships not
addressed by studies from other areas. Results: Individual innovative behaviour
is influenced by individual attitudes and also by situational factors such as
relationships in the workplace, organizational characteristics, and project
type. We built a model to express the interacting effects of these factors.
Conclusions: Innovative behaviour is dependent on individual and contextual
factors. Our results contribute to relevant impacts on research and practice,
and to topics that deserve further study.
