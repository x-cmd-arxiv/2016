dominant energy condition is desirable for describing the positive

another option, a linear combination between the Bel-Robinson tensor $B$ and

Petrov types as the verification, we found that this dominant property

$B_{0000}\geq|B_{\alpha\beta{}00}|$ and $B_{0000}\geq|B_{0123}|$, instead of

Supplementary 22 GHz VLA observations are used to better constrain the

exchanges its inclination for eccentricity, and vice versa. Self-gravity may
suppress the cycles under some circumstances. However, with hydrodynamic
simulations including self-gravity we show that for a sufficiently high initial
disk tilts and for certain disk masses, disks can undergo KL oscillations and
fragment due to GI, even when the Toomre Q value for an equivalent undisturbed
disk is well within the stable regime (Q > 2). We suggest that KL triggered
disk fragmentation provides a mechanism for the efficient formation of giant
planets in binary systems and may enhance fragmentation of disks in massive

We consider Bose Josephson junctions, where ultracold bosons are trapped in a

accuracy and are suited and used to study macroscopic quantum phenomena on
scale of microns with a number of particles typically ranging from $\sim
10^2-10^3$ to $\sim 10^5-10^6$. We study the CSL dynamics of three atomic
states showing macroscopic quantum coherence: the atomic coherent state, the
superposition of two atomic coherent states, and the NOON state. We show that
for the last two states the suppression of quantum coherence induced by CSL
model increases exponentially with the number of atoms. We observe that, in the
case of optically trapped atoms, the spontaneous photon emission of the atoms
induce a dynamics similar to the CSL one and we conclude that magnetically
trapped atoms may be more convenient to experimentally test the CSL model. We
finally discuss decoherence effects in order to provide reasonable estimates on

and dust temperature Td) allow us to estimate the amount and distribution of
the hydrogen gas more accurately, and our previous studies revealed the
existence of a large amount of optically-thick HI gas in the solar
neighborhood. Referring to this, we discuss the neutral hydrogen gas around the
Perseus cloud in the present paper. By using the J-band extinction data, we
found that tau353 increases as a function of the 1.3-th power of column number
density of the total hydrogen (NH), and this implies dust evolution in high
density regions. This calibrated tau353-NH relationship shows that the amount
of the HI gas can be underestimated to be ~60% if the optically-thin HI method
is used. Based on this relationship, we calculated optical depth of the 21 cm
line (tauHI), and found that <tauHI> ~ 0.92 around the molecular cloud. The
effect of tauHI is still significant even if we take into account the dust
evolution. We also estimated a spatial distribution of the CO-to-H2 conversion
factor (XCO), and we found its average value is <XCO> ~ 1.0x10^20 cm-2 K-1 km-1

discrepancies can be well explained by the difference of the data and analyses

deep architecture (a Set2Model network) that maps sets of examples to simple
generative probabilistic models such as Gaussians or mixtures of Gaussians in
the space of high-dimensional descriptors. The parameters of the embedding into
the descriptor space are trained in the end-to-end fashion in the meta-learning

our approach is the derivation of the backprop process through the mixture
model fitting, which makes the likelihood of the resulting models
differentiable with respect to the positions of the input descriptors.
  While the meta-learning process for a Set2Model network is discriminative, a
trained Set2Model network performs generative learning of generative models in
the descriptor space, which facilitates learning in the cases when no negative
examples are available, and whenever the concept being learned is polysemous or
represented by noisy training sets. Among other experiments, we demonstrate

advantage of spacecraft Voyager 1's capacity for detecting interstellar CRs
since it crossed the heliopause in 2012. This opens up a new avenue to probe DM
in the sub-GeV energy/mass range that we exploit here for the first time. From
a complete description of the transport of electrons and positrons at low
energy, we derive predictions for both the secondary astrophysical background
and the pair production mechanisms relevant to DM annihilation or decay down to
the MeV mass range. Interestingly, we show that reacceleration may push
positrons up to energies larger than the DM particle mass. We combine the
constraints from the Voyager and AMS-02 data to get novel limits covering a
very extended DM particle mass range, from MeV to TeV. In the MeV mass range,
our limits reach annihilation cross sections of order $\langle \sigma v\rangle
\sim 10^{-28}{\rm cm^3/s}$. An interesting aspect is that these limits barely
depend on the details of cosmic-ray propagation in the weak reacceleration
case, a configuration which seems to be favored by the most recent
boron-to-carbon ($B/C$) data. Though extracted from a completely different and

nondeterminism in transactional execution: they provide the illusion of
executing in a deterministic serial order, unlike traditional transactions
which appear to execute in a nondeterministic order that can change from
execution to execution. Pot uses a new concurrency control protocol that
exploits the serialization order to distinguish between fast and speculative
transaction execution modes in order to mitigate the overhead of imposing a
deterministic order. We build two Pot prototypes: one using STM and another
using off-the-shelf HTM. To the best of our knowledge, Pot enables
deterministic execution of programs using off-the-shelf HTM for the first time.
An experimental evaluation shows that Pot achieves deterministic execution of
TM programs with low overhead, sometimes even outperforming nondeterministic
executions, and clearly outperforming the state of the art.

$\alpha_0$ in the single index model $E[Y |X] = f_0(\alpha_0^T X)$ with $f_0$
the unknown ridge function defined on $\mathbb{R}$, $X$ a d-dimensional
covariate and $Y$ the response. We show that when $X$ is Gaussian, then
$\alpha_0$ can be consistently estimated by regressing the observed responses
$Y_i$, $i = 1, . . ., n$ on the covariates $X_1, . . ., X_n$ after centering
and rescaling. The method works without any additional smoothness assumptions
on $f_0$ and only requires that $cov(f_0(\alpha_0^T X),\alpha_0^TX) \neq 0$,
which is always satisfied by monotone and non-constant functions $f_0$. We show
that our estimator is asymptotically normal and give the expression with its
asymptotic variance. The approach is illustrated through a simulation study.

entropy never decreases. Most physical processes we observe in nature involve
variations of macroscopic quantities over spatial and temporal scales much
larger than microscopic molecular collision scales and thus can be considered
as in local equilibrium. For a many-body system in local equilibrium a stronger
version of the second law applies which says that the entropy production at
each spacetime point should be non-negative. In this paper we provide a proof
of the second law for such systems and a first derivation of the local second
law. For this purpose we develop a general non-equilibrium effective field
theory of slow degrees of freedom from integrating out fast degrees of freedom
in a quantum many-body system and consider its classical limit. The key
elements of the proof are the presence of a $Z_2$ symmetry, which can be
considered as a proxy for local equilibrium and micro-time-reversibility, and a
classical remnant of quantum unitarity. The $Z_2$ symmetry leads to a local
current from a procedure analogous to that used in the Noether theorem.
Unitarity leads to a definite sign of the divergence of the current. We also
discuss the origin of an arrow of time, as well as the coincidence of causal
and thermodynamical arrows of time. Applied to hydrodynamics, the proof gives a
first-principle derivation of the phenomenological entropy current condition
and provides a constructive procedure for obtaining the entropy current.

plane problems of elasticity are considered. The first one concerns the case
when the upper side of the inclusion is completely debonded from the matrix,
and the crack penetrates into the medium. In the second model, the upper side
of the inclusion is partly separated from the matrix, that is the crack length
$2a$ is less than $2b$, the inclusion length. It is shown that both problems
are governed by a singular integral equation of the same structure. Derivation
of the closed-form solution of this integral equation is the main result of the
paper. The solution is found by solving the associated vector Riemann-Hilbert
problem with the Chebotarev-Khrapkov matrix coefficient. A feature of the
method proposed is that the vector Riemann-Hilbert problem is set on a finite
segment, while the original Khrapkov method of matrix factorization is
developed for a closed contour. In the case, when the crack and inclusion
lengths are the same, the solution is derived by passing to the limit $b/a\to
1$. It is demonstrated that the limiting case $a=b$ is unstable, and when
$a<b$, and the crack tips approach the inclusion ends, the crack tends to
accelerate in order to penetrate into the matrix.

is developed, extending our previous study of an axisymmetric eroding dipole

large ""self-stretching"" of vorticity, with the possibility of finite-time
blow-up. We derive a system of partial differential equations of ""generalized""
form, involving contour averaging of a locally two-dimensional Euler flow. We
do not attempt here to solve the system exactly, but point out that
non-existence of physically acceptable solutions would most probably be a
result of the axial flow. Because of the axial flow the vorticity distribution
within the dipole eddies is no longer of the simple Sadovskii type (vorticity
constant over a cross-section) obtained in the axisymmetric problem. Thus the
solution of the system depends upon the existence of a larger class of
propagating two-dimensional dipoles.
  The hairpin model is obtained by formal asymptotic analysis. As in the
axisymmetric problem a local transformation to ""shrinking"" coordinates is
introduced, but now in a self-similar form appropriate to the study of a
possible finite-time singularity. We discuss some properties of the model,
including a study of the helicity and a first step in iterating toward a
solution from the Sadovskii structure. We also present examples of
two-dimensional propagating dipoles not previously studied, which have a
vorticity profile consistent with our model. Although no rigorous results can
be given, and analysis of the system is only partial, the formal calculations
are consistent with the possibility of a finite time blowup of vorticity at a
point of vanishing circulation of the dipole eddies, but depending upon the
existence of the necessary two-dimensional propagating dipole.

algorithm, which simulates the motion of a large number of model particles in a
turbulent velocity field; for each particle, a trajectory is calculated with a
numerical timestepping method. Choosing an efficient numerical method is
particularly important in operational emergency-response applications, such as
tracking radioactive clouds from nuclear accidents or predicting the impact of
volcanic ash clouds on international aviation, where accurate and timely
predictions are essential. In this paper, we investigate the application of the
Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to simulate the propagation of particles

computational complexity and reduced computational cost when compared to the
Standard Monte Carlo (StMC) method, which is currently used in atmospheric
dispersion modelling. To reduce the absolute cost of the method also in the
non-asymptotic regime, it is equally important to choose the best possible
numerical timestepping method on each level. To investigate this, we also
compare the standard symplectic Euler method, which is used in many operational
models, with two improved timestepping algorithms based on SDE splitting

Navier-Stokes equations, such as equilibria and periodic orbits, provide a
skeleton for turbulence dynamics in state-space. Many of these solutions have
been found for flat-walled plane Couette, channel, and pipe flows. Rough-walled
flows are of great practical significance, yet no recurring solutions are known
for these flows. We present a numerical homotopy method to continue solutions
from flat-walled plane Couette flow (PCF) to grooved PCF, demonstrated here at
a Reynolds number of 400, to act as a starting point for similar continuation
to rough-walled flows. Loss of spanwise homogeneity in grooved PCF reduces
continuous families of solutions (identical up to translational shifts) in
flat-walled Couette flow to multiple, discrete families in grooved Couette
flow; this can manifest in turbulence as spatially anchored exact coherent
structures near the wall, so that turbulent statistics reflect
symmetry-restricted structure of exact recurring solutions. Furthermore, the
vortex-streak structures characteristic of these equilibria are squeezed out of
the grooves when the groove-wavelength is smaller than the characteristic
spanwise size of the structures. This produces reduced shear stress at the wall

Relativity (GR) effects by using Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds eclipses to

spectral model for X-ray eclipses is introduced. First we present the different

regions size, the emissivity index, the cloud's column density, ionization,
size and velocity, the black hole spin, and the system's inclination. Then we
highlight some theoretical predictions on the observables by using XMM-Newton
simulations, finding that absorption varies depending on the photons' energy
range, being maximum when the approaching side of the X-ray-emitting region is
covered. Finally, we fit our relativistic model to actual XMM-Newton data from
a long observation of the NLS1 galaxy SWIFT J2127.4+5654, and compare our

entries, and (iii) a sparse vector where a constant fraction $\rho$ of entries
are i.i.d. $\pm 1$ and the rest are zero. For each of these cases, our upper
and lower bounds match up to a $1+o(1)$ factor as the order $d$ of the tensor
becomes large. For sparse signals (iii), our bounds are also asymptotically
tight in the sparse limit $\rho \to 0$ for any fixed $d$ (including the $d=2$
case of sparse PCA). Our upper bounds for (i) demonstrate a phenomenon
reminiscent of the work of Baik, Ben Arous and P\'ech\'e: an `eigenvalue' of a
perturbed tensor emerges from the bulk at a strictly lower signal-to-noise
ratio than when the perturbation itself exceeds the bulk; we quantify the size
of this effect. We also provide some general results for larger classes of
priors. In particular, the large $d$ asymptotics of the threshold location
differs between problems with discrete priors versus continuous priors.
Finally, for priors (i) and (ii) we carry out the replica prediction from
statistical physics, which is conjectured to give the exact

  Of independent interest, we introduce a new improvement to the second moment

from which secrecy cannot be extracted. The existence of bound secrecy has been
conjectured but is currently unproven, and in this work we provide analytical
and numerical evidence for its existence. Specifically, we consider two-way
post-processing protocols in prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution based
on the well-known six-state signal states. In terms of the quantum bit-error
rate $Q$ of the classical data, such protocols currently exist for
$Q<\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}\approx 27.6\%$. On the other hand, for
$Q\geq\frac{1}{3}$ no such protocol can exist as the observed data is
compatible with an intercept-resend attack. This leaves the interesting
question of whether successful protocols exist in the interval
$\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}\leq Q<\frac{1}{3}$.
  Previous work has shown that a necessary condition for the existence of
two-way post-processing protocols for distilling secret key is breaking the
symmetric extendability of the underlying quantum state shared by Alice and
Bob. Using this result, it has been proven that symmetric extendability can be
broken up to the $27.6\%$ lower bound using the advantage distillation
protocol. In this work, we first show that to break symmetric extendability it
is sufficient to consider a generalized form of advantage distillation
consisting of one round of post-selection by Bob on a block of his data. We
then provide evidence that such generalized protocols cannot break symmetric
extendability beyond $27.6\%$. We thus have evidence to believe that $27.6\%$
is an upper bound on two-way post-processing and that the interval
$\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{10}\leq Q<\frac{1}{3}$ is a domain of bound secrecy.

masses. The experiments indicate that if gravity does reduce to the pairwise
Newtonian interaction between atoms at the low energies, this interaction
cannot arise from the exchange of just classical information, and in principle
has the capacity to create entanglement. We clarify that, contrary to current
belief, the classical-channel description of gravity differs from the model of
Diosi and Penrose, which is not constrained by the same data.

applications in enterprise security and attack scenario reconstruction. While
existing techniques focus on either reconstructing abnormal scenarios or
filtering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider
the two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and
better understand anomaly behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a
collaborative alerts ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content
correlations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a
tree-based model to capture both short-term correlations and long-term
dependencies in each alert sequence, which identifies abnormal action
sequences. Then, an embedding-based model is employed to learn the content
correlations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes.
Finally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into one
optimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert
patterns. Our experiments, using real-world enterprise monitoring data and real
attacks launched by professional hackers, show that CAR can accurately identify
true positive alerts and successfully reconstruct attack scenarios at the same
time.

measurements of the Fermi-Hubbard model in a spin-imbalanced atomic gas,
allowing us to explore the response of the system to large effective magnetic
fields. We observe short-range canted antiferromagnetism at half-filling with
stronger spin correlations in the direction orthogonal to the magnetization, in
contrast with the spin-balanced case where identical correlations are measured
for any projection of the pseudospin. The rotational anisotropy of the spin
correlators is found to increase with polarization and with distance between
the spins. Away from half-filling, the polarization of the gas exhibits
non-monotonic behavior with doping for strong interactions, resembling the
behavior of the magnetic susceptibility in the cuprates. We compare our
measurements to predictions from Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and
Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) algorithms and find good agreement.
Calculations on the doped system are near the limits of these techniques,
illustrating the value of cold atom quantum simulations for studying
strongly-correlated materials.

spatially localized solutions in real scalar field theories. Contrary to the
case of Q-balls, there is no evident conserved charge that stabilizes the
localized configuration. Nevertheless, in many classical numerical simulations,
it has been shown that they are extremely long-lived. In this paper, we clarify
the reason for the longevity, and show how the exponential separation of time
scales emerges dynamically. Those solutions are time-periodic with a typical
frequency of a mass scale of a scalar field. This observation implies that they
can be understood by the effective theory after integrating out relativistic
modes. We find that the resulting effective theory has an approximate global
U(1) symmetry reflecting an approximate number conservation in the
non-relativistic regime. As a result, the profile of those solutions is
obtained via the bounce method, just like Q-balls, as long as the breaking of
the U(1) symmetry is small enough. We then discuss the decay processes of the
I-ball/oscillon by the breaking of the U(1) symmetry, namely the production of
relativistic modes via number violating processes. We show that the imaginary
part is exponentially suppressed, which explains the extraordinary longevity of
I-ball/oscillon. In addition, we find that there are some attractor behaviors
during the evolution of I-ball/oscillon that further enhance the lifetime. The
validity of our effective theory is confirmed by classical numerical
simulations. Our formalism may also be useful to study condensates of ultra
light bosonic dark matter, such as fuzzy dark matter, and axion stars, for

information coming from the SBL setups is taken into account. We also assess
the robustness/fragility of the estimates of the standard 3-flavor parameters
in the more general 3+1 scheme. To this regard we find that: i) the indication
of CP-violation found in the 3-flavor analyses persists also in the 3+1 scheme,
with $\delta_{13} \equiv \delta$ having still its best fit value around
$-\pi/2$; ii) the 3-flavor weak hint in favor of the normal hierarchy becomes
even less significant when sterile neutrinos come into play; iii) the weak
indication of non-maximal $\theta_{23}$ (driven by NO$\nu$A disappearance data)
persists in the 3+1 scheme, where maximal mixing is disfavored at almost the
90\% C.L. in both normal and inverted mass hierarchy; iv) the preference in
favor of one of the two octants of $\theta_{23}$ found in the 3-flavor
framework (higher octant for inverted mass hierarchy) is completely washed out
in the 3+1 scheme.

from the same distribution as the normal examples. Instead of directly training
a deep neural network to detect adversarials, a much simpler approach was
proposed based on statistics on outputs from convolutional layers. A cascade
classifier was designed to efficiently detect adversarials. Furthermore,
trained from one particular adversarial generating mechanism, the resulting
classifier can successfully detect adversarials from a completely different
mechanism as well. The resulting classifier is non-subdifferentiable, hence
creates a difficulty for adversaries to attack by using the gradient of the
classifier. After detecting adversarial examples, we show that many of them can
be recovered by simply performing a small average filter on the image. Those
findings should lead to more insights about the classification mechanisms in
deep convolutional neural networks.

brain structure and function, leading to a stable network topology in
adulthood. However, most prior work has examined the data through the lens of
brain areas connected to one another in large-scale functional networks. Here,
we apply a recently-developed hypergraph approach that treats network
connections (edges) rather than brain regions as the unit of interest, allowing
us to describe functional network topology from a fundamentally different
perspective. Capitalizing on a sample of 780 youth imaged as part of the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, this hypergraph representation of
resting-state functional MRI data reveals three distinct classes of
sub-networks (hyperedges): clusters, bridges, and stars, which represent
spatially distributed, bipartite, and focal architectures, respectively.
Cluster hyperedges show a strong resemblance to the functional modules of the
brain including somatomotor, visual, default mode, and salience systems. In
contrast, star hyperedges represent highly localized subnetworks centered on a
small set of regions, and are distributed across the entire cortex. Finally,
bridge hyperedges link clusters and stars in a core-periphery organization.
Notably, developmental changes within hyperedges are ordered in a similar
core-periphery fashion, with the greatest developmental effects occurring in
networked hyperedges within the functional core. Taken together, these results
emphasize that the network organization of human brain emerges across multiple
scales and evolves substantially through the adolescent period.

Malhotra et al. (2016) that Planet Nine is in small integer ratio mean-motion

observed KBO semi-major axes present a set of commensurabilities with an unseen

greater than $98\%$ chance of stemming from a sequence of MMRs rather than from
a random distribution. We describe and implement a Monte-Carlo optimization
scheme that drives billion-year dynamical integrations of the outer solar
system to pinpoint the orbital properties of perturbers that are capable of
maintaining the KBOs' apsidal alignment. This optimization exercise suggests
that the unseen planet is most consistently represented with mass, $m \sim 6-12

$e\sim0.45$, inclination, $i \sim 30^{\circ}$, argument of periastron, $\omega

observed to be strongly hierarchical, while analogous parameters in the
neutrino sector appear to be structure-less or anarchical. We develop a class
of unified models based on SU(5) symmetry that explains these differing
features probabilistically. With the aid of three input parameters that are

uncorrelated random variables described by Gaussian distributions, we show by
Monte Carlo simulations that the observed features of the entire fermion

meteorites) in the inner main belt. In this work we identify V-type asteroids
outside the dynamical Vesta family whose rotational properties (retrograde vs
prograde rotation) suggest the direction of Yarkovsky drift that sets them
apart from typical Vestoids and Vesta fugitives. Specifically Nesvorny et al.
2008 simulated escapes paths from the Vesta family and showed that typical
Vesta fugitives in the inner main asteroid belt at semi-major axis a < 2.3 AU
have to have retrograde rotations and physical and thermal parameters that
maximize the Yarkovsky force in order to evolve to scattered orbits within 1-2
Gyrs (age of the Vesta collisional family). Therefore large asteroids outside
the Vesta family and with a < 2.3 AU and having thermal and rotational
properties minimizing the Yarkovsky drift or showing Yarkovsky drift direction
towards (4) Vesta are the best candidates for non-Vestoids V-type asteroids and
therefore parent bodies of anomalous HED. In this study, we have performed
accurate photometric observations and determined sense of rotation for several
asteroids testing their links to Vesta and anomalous HED. We have found several
potential non-Vestoid candidates. Those objects have to be studied in more

with reflection and/or time-reversal symmetry is the value of the path integral
on non-orientable space-time manifolds. We derive a simple general formula for
the path integral on the manifold $\Sigma^2 \times S^1$, where $\Sigma^2$ is a
two-dimensional non-orientable surface and $S^1$ is a circle. This also gives
an expression for the ground state degeneracy of the SET on the surface
$\Sigma^2$ that depends on the reflection symmetry fractionalization class,
generalizing the Verlinde formula for ground state degeneracy on orientable
surfaces. Consistency of the action of the mapping class group on
non-orientable manifolds leads us to a constraint that can detect when a
time-reversal or reflection SET phase is anomalous in (2+1)D and, thus, can
only exist at the surface of a (3+1)D symmetry protected topological (SPT)

unusual because it involves the creation of bulk chiral charges and the
nucleation of topological Fermi arcs. Here we image a topological phase
transition to a Weyl semimetal in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ with changing

operator product expansion (OPE), namely a weighted sum of OPE coefficients
squared. We compute the weights for scale anomalies associated with scalar
operators and show that they are not positive. We then derive a different sum
rule of the same form in Minkowski momentum space where the weights are
positive. The positivity arises because the scale anomaly is the coefficient of
a logarithm in the momentum space four-point function. This logarithm also
determines the dispersive part, which is a positive sum over states by the
optical theorem. The momentum space sum rule may be invalidated by UV and/or IR
divergences, and we discuss the conditions under which these singularities are

circumstellar disks are strongly misaligned with respect to the binary

dark matter direct detection experiments, properly identifying the underlying
dark matter-nuclei interaction promises to be a challenging task. Given the
most optimistic expectations for the number counts of recoil events in the
forthcoming Generation 2 experiments, differentiating between interactions that
produce distinct features in the recoil energy spectra will only be possible if
a strong signal is observed simultaneously on a variety of complementary
targets. However, there is a wide range of viable theories that give rise to
virtually identical energy spectra, and may only differ by the dependence of
the recoil rate on the dark matter velocity. In this work, we investigate how
degeneracy between such competing models may be broken by analyzing the time
dependence of nuclear recoils, i.e. the annual modulation of the rate. For this
purpose, we simulate dark matter events for a variety of interactions and
experiments, and perform a Bayesian model-selection analysis on all simulated
data sets, evaluating the chance of correctly identifying the input model for a
given experimental setup. We find that including information on the annual
modulation of the rate may significantly enhance the ability of a single target
to distinguish dark matter models with nearly degenerate recoil spectra, but
only with exposures beyond the expectations of Generation 2 experiments.

large-scale peculiar velocity field in the form of spatially correlated
scatter, which allows for bounds on bulk flows and the growth rate of matter
density perturbations using large galaxy redshift surveys. We apply this
luminosity approach to galaxies from the recent SDSS Data Release 13. Our goal
is twofold. First, we take advantage of the recalibrated photometry to identify
possible systematic errors relevant to our previous analysis of earlier data.
Second, we seek improved constraints on the bulk flow and the normalized growth
rate f$\sigma_{8}$ at z ~ 0.1. Our results confirm the robustness of our
method. Bulk flow amplitudes, estimated in two redshift bins with 0.02 <
z$_{1}$ < 0.07 < z$_{2}$ < 0.22, are generally smaller than in previous
measurements, consistent with both the updated photometry and expectations for
the $\Lambda$CDM model. The obtained growth rate, f$\sigma_{8}$ = 0.48 +/-
0.16, is larger than, but still compatible with, its previous estimate, and
closer to the reference value of Planck. Rather than precision, the importance
of these results is due to the fact that they follow from an independent method
that relies on accurate photometry, which is a top requirement for
next-generation photometric catalogs.

Taylor (2015), which allows for selective inference in non-parametric settings
by adjusting for the asymptotic Gaussian limit for selection. Under some
regularity assumptions on the density of the randomization, including heavier
tails than Gaussian satisfied by e.g. logistic distribution, we prove the
selective CLT holds without any assumptions on the underlying parameter,
allowing for rare selection events. We also show a selective CLT result for
Gaussian randomization, though the quantitative results are qualitatively
different for the Gaussian randomization as compared to the heavier tailed
results. Furthermore, we propose a bootstrap version of this test statistic,
which is provably asymptotically pivotal uniformly across a family of
non-parametric distributions. This result can be interpreted as resolving the
impossibility results of Leeb and Potscher (2006). We describe several sampling
methods involving the projected Langevin Monte Carlo to compute the
bootstrapped test statistic and the corresponding confidence intervals valid
after selection. The applications of our work include valid inferential and
sampling tools after running various model selection algorithms including their
combinations into multiple views/queries framework. We also present a way to do
data carving, providing more powerful tests than classical data splitting by
reusing the information in the data from the first stage.

made it harder and harder to deploy new transport or higher layer protocols, or
even extensions to existing ones. Current work to address this Internet
transport ossification has led to renewed interest in UDP as an encapsulation
for making novel transport protocols deployable in the Internet. Examples
include Google's QUIC and the WebRTC data channel. The common assumption made
by these approaches is that encapsulation over UDP works in the present
Internet. This paper presents a measurement study to examine this assumption,
and provides guidance for protocol design based on our measurements.
  The key question is ""can we run new transport protocols for the Internet over
UDP?"" We find that the answer is largely ""yes"": UDP works on most networks, and
impairments are generally confined to access networks. This allows relatively
simple fallback strategies to work around it. Our answer is based on a twofold
methodology. First, we use the RIPE Atlas platform to basically check UDP
connectivity and first-packet latency. Second, we deploy copycat, a new tool
for comparing TCP loss, latency, and throughput with UDP by generating
TCP-shaped traffic with UDP headers.

Neglecting terms which change the number of spinons yields the variational

electron wave packet exhibits a trembling or oscillating behavior during its

To directly observe ZB in electronic systems is difficult, due to the
challenges associated with the atomic scale wavelength of the electron.
Photonic systems offer an alternative paradigm. We exploit the concept of
pseudo parity-time (pseudo PT ) symmetry to study ZB in non-Hermitian quantum
systems implemented as an experimentally feasible optical waveguide array. In
particular, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is realized through evanescent
coupling among the waveguides to form a one-dimensional lattice with periodic
modulations in gain and loss along the guiding direction. As the modulation
frequency is changed, we obtain a number of phenomena including periodically
suppressed ZB trembling, spatial energy localization, and Hermitian-like ZB
oscillations. We calculate phase diagrams indicating the emergence of different
types of dynamical behaviors of the relativistic non-Hermitian quantum system
in an experimentally justified parameter space. We provide numerical results
and a physical analysis to explain the distinct dynamical behaviors revealed by
the phase diagrams. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of both the
relativistic ZB phenomenon and non-Hermitian pseudo-PT systems, with potential
applications in controlling/harnessing light propagation in waveguide-based

distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U)

information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses
an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but
with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key
modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid
artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a
local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of
refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic
images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We
quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze
estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over
using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze

Way (MW) and quantify the implications on properties of the dark matter
particle and the phenomenology of low-mass galaxy formation. This is done
through a probabilistic comparison of the luminosity function of MW dwarf
satellite galaxies to models based on two suites of zoom-in simulations. One
suite is dark-matter-only while the other includes a disk component, therefore
we can quantify the effect of the MW's baryonic disk on our results. We apply
numerous Stellar-Mass-Halo-Mass (SMHM) relations allowing for multiple
complexities: scatter, a characteristic break scale, and subhalos which host no
galaxy. In contrast to previous works we push the model/data comparison to the
faintest dwarfs by modeling observational incompleteness, allowing us to draw
three new conclusions. Firstly, we constrain the SMHM relation for
$10^2<M_*/M_\odot<10^8$ galaxies, allowing us to bound the peak halo mass of
the faintest MW satellite to $M_\mathrm{vir}>2.4\times10^8M_\odot$ ($1\sigma$).
Secondly, by translating to a Warm Dark Matter (WDM) cosmology, we bound the
thermal relic mass $m_\mathrm{WDM}>2.9$ keV at 95\% confidence, on a par with
recent constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Lastly, we find that the
observed number of ultra-faint MW dwarfs is in tension with the theoretical
prediction that reionisation prevents galaxy formation in almost all
$10^8M_\odot$ halos. This can be tested with the next generation of deep
imaging surveys. To this end, we predict the likely number of detectable
satellite galaxies in the Subaru/HSC survey and the LSST. Confronting these
predictions with future observations will be amongst our strongest tests of WDM
and the effect reionisation on low-mass systems.

allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed

accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the
categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such
understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to
individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently
developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear
classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and
adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words.
Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall
classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from
text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We
further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based
document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these
document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show
that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of
classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability

other applications.

implemented in terms of their network dynamics. Hence, recovering the system
dynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple
single-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward
understanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space
representation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing
equations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a
computationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has
been extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems
perspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation
scheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of
state space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent
dynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is
used to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace
approximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the
procedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the
rodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical
working memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to
be sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task
performance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models
were rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the
vicinity of a bifurcation point. In summary, the present work advances a
semi-analytical (thus reasonably fast) maximum-likelihood estimation framework
for PLRNNs that may enable to recover the relevant dynamics underlying observed
neuronal time series, and directly link them to computational properties.

high-quality industrial scale amounts of 2D materials is chemical vapor
deposition (CVD), which results in polycrystalline samples. As grain boundaries

structure is of paramount importance. Here, through atomic-scale analysis of
micrometer-long GBs, we show that covalently bound boundaries in 2D MoS2 tend
to be decorated by nanopores. Such boundaries occur when differently oriented
MoS2 grains merge during growth, whereas the overlap of grains leads to
boundaries with bilayer areas. Our results suggest that the nanopore formation
is related to stress release in areas with a high concentration of dislocation

intrinsic rippling at the overlap regions. This provides insights for the

Generally, their largest possible precision is limited by Brownian motion and
low frequency changes to the system. The signal to noise ratio is usually
improved by increasing the size of the driven motion compared to the Brownian
as well as averaging over repeated measurements. New theory is presented here
which gives the complex shear modulus when the motion of a spherical particle
is driven by non-linear forces. In some scenarios error can be further reduced
by applying a variable transformation which linearises the equation of motion.
This allows normalisation which eliminates low frequency drift in the
particle's equilibrium position. Using this method will easily increase the
signal strength enough to significantly reduce the measurement time for the
same error. Thus the method is more conducive to measuring viscoelasticity in

stands out in several respects. First, the SPI problem has a unique solution
(up to a scale factor), which satisfies a natural degree bound. Second, the SPI
problem can be transformed (monomialized) into an equivalent SPI problem where
all moduli are monomials. Third, the SPI problem can be solved by an efficient
algorithm of the Berlekamp--Massey type. Fourth, decoding interleaved
Reed--Solomon codes (or subfield-evaluation codes) beyond half the minimum
distance can be analyzed in terms of a partial-inverse condition for the error
pattern: if that condition is satisfied, then the (true) error locator
polynomial is the unique solution of a standard key equation and can be

polarization open new window into the early Universe. One of these is
anisotropies of the cosmic polarization rotation which probes the Chern-Simons
term generally predicted by string theory. The anisotropies of the cosmic
rotation are also generated by the primordial magnetism and in the Standard
Model extention framework. The cosmic rotation anisotropies can be
reconstructed as quadratic in CMB anisotropies. However, the power of the
reconstructed cosmic rotation is a CMB four-point correlation and is not
directly related to the cosmic-rotation power spectrum. Understanding all
contributions in the four-point correlation is required to extract the cosmic
rotation signal. Assuming a scale-invariant rotation spectrum motivated by the
inflationary cosmic-rotation models, we employ simulation to quantify each

action attributes enables the development of models for human activity
recognition and summarization. We present an extension of the low-rank
representation (LRR) model, termed the clustering-aware structure-constrained
low-rank representation (CS-LRR) model, for unsupervised learning of human
action attributes from video data. Our model is based on the union-of-subspaces
(UoS) framework, and integrates spectral clustering into the LRR optimization
problem for better subspace clustering results. We lay out an efficient linear
alternating direction method to solve the CS-LRR optimization problem. We also
introduce a hierarchical subspace clustering approach, termed hierarchical
CS-LRR, to learn the attributes without the need for a priori specification of
their number. By visualizing and labeling these action attributes, the
hierarchical model can be used to semantically summarize long video sequences
of human actions at multiple resolutions. A human action or activity can also
be uniquely represented as a sequence of transitions from one action attribute
to another, which can then be used for human action recognition. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model for semantic summarization and action
recognition through comprehensive experiments on five real-world human action
datasets.

enable the formation of exciton pulses, the interplay of atomic motion and
electronic excitation transfer which feature high fidelity entanglement
transport.
  Here, we demonstrate the coherent splitting of such pulses into two modes,
which induce strongly different atomic motion, leading to clear signatures of
nonadiabatic effects in atomic density profiles. The mechanism exploits local
nonadiabatic effects at a conical intersection, turning them from a decoherence
source into an asset. The conical intersection is a consequence of the exciton
pulses moving along a linear Rydberg chain and approaching an additional
linear, perpendicularly aligned Rydberg chain. The intersection provides a
sensitive knob controlling the propagation direction and coherence properties
of exciton pulses.
  We demonstrate that this scenario can be exploited as an exciton switch,
controlling direction and coherence properties of the joint pulse on the second
of the chains. Initially, we demonstrate the pulse splitting on planar
aggregates with atomic motion one-dimensionally constrained and employing
isotropic interactions. Subsequently, we confirm the splitting mechanism for a
fully realistic scenario in which all spatial restrictions are removed and the
full anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions is taken into account. Our
results enable the experimental observation of non-adiabatic electronic
dynamics and entanglement transport with Rydberg atoms. The conical
intersection crossings are clearly evident, both in atomic mean position
information and excited state spectra of the Rydberg system. This suggests
flexible Rydberg aggregates as a test-bench for quantum chemical effects in
experiments on much-inflated length scales. The fundamental ideas discussed
here have general implications for excitons on a dynamic network.

for the interpretation of microwave diagnostic data and for assessing the
feasibility of EBW heating and current drive. While the coupling is reasonably
well-understood in the linear regime, nonlinear physics arising from high input

performed one- and two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations

We find that the ion dynamics has a profound effect on the field structure in

based on a random sample of revealed entries. In terms of the required sample
size, earlier work revealed a large gap between estimation with unbounded
computational resources (using, for instance, tensor nuclear norm minimization)
and polynomial-time algorithms. Among the latter, the best statistical
guarantees have been proved, for third-order tensors, using the sixth level of
the sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming hierarchy (Barak and Moitra,
2014). However, the SOS approach does not scale well to large problem
instances. By contrast, spectral methods --- based on unfolding or matricizing
the tensor --- are attractive for their low complexity, but have been believed
to require a much larger sample size.
  This paper presents two main contributions. First, we propose a new
unfolding-based method, which outperforms naive ones for symmetric $k$-th order
tensors of rank $r$. For this result we make a study of singular space
estimation for partially revealed matrices of large aspect ratio, which may be
of independent interest. For third-order tensors, our algorithm matches the SOS
method in terms of sample size (requiring about $rd^{3/2}$ revealed entries),
subject to a worse rank condition ($r\ll d^{3/4}$ rather than $r\ll d^{3/2}$).
We complement this result with a different spectral algorithm for third-order
tensors in the overcomplete ($r\ge d$) regime. Under a random model, this
second approach succeeds in estimating tensors of rank $d\le r \ll d^{3/2}$
from about $rd^{3/2}$ revealed entries.

remarkable conclusion that the $J=2$ state disappears with a potential which is
much more attractive than for $J=0$, where a bound state is found. We trace
this abnormal conclusion to the fact that an ""on-shell"" factorization of the

large discontinuous and unphysical imaginary part. A method is developed,
evaluating the loops with full $\rho$ propagators, and we show that they do not
develop singularities and do not have an imaginary part below threshold. With
this result for the loops we define an effective potential, which when used
with the Bethe-Salpeter equation provides a state with $J=2$ around the energy
of the $f_2(1270)$. In addition, the coupling of the state to $\rho\rho$ is
evaluated and we find that this coupling and the $T$ matrix around the energy

the shapes of physical objects as observed from a particular viewpoint. This
information is important when synthesizing images of different virtual camera
viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). It has been shown that depth
images can be efficiently coded using contour-adaptive codecs that preserve
edge sharpness, resulting in visually pleasing DIBR-synthesized images.
However, contours are typically losslessly coded as side information (SI),
which is expensive if the object shapes are complex.
  In this paper, we pursue a new paradigm in depth image coding for
color-plus-depth representation of a 3D scene: we pro-actively simplify object
shapes in a depth and color image pair to reduce depth coding cost, at a
penalty of a slight increase in synthesized view distortion. Specifically, we
first mathematically derive a distortion upper-bound proxy for 3DSwIM---a
quality metric tailored for DIBR-synthesized images. This proxy reduces
interdependency among pixel rows in a block to ease optimization. We then
approximate object contours via a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to
optimally trade off coding cost of contours using arithmetic edge coding (AEC)
with our proposed view synthesis distortion proxy. We modify the depth and
color images according to the approximated object contours in an inter-view
consistent manner. These are then coded respectively using a contour-adaptive
image codec based on graph Fourier transform (GFT) for edge preservation and
HEVC intra. Experimental results show that by maintaining sharp but simplified
object contours during contour-adaptive coding, for the same visual quality of
DIBR-synthesized virtual views, our proposal can reduce depth image coding rate
by up to 22% compared to alternative coding strategies such as HEVC intra.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at $z \gsim 6$. The formation of a
DCBH requires a strong external radiation field to suppress $\rm H_2$ formation
and cooling in a collapsing gas cloud. Such strong field is not easily achieved
by first stars or normal star-forming galaxies. Here we investigate a scenario
in which the previously-formed DCBH can provide the necessary radiation field
for the formation of additional ones. Using one-zone model and the simulated
DCBH Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) filtered through absorbing gas
initially having column density $N_{\rm H}$, we derive the critical field
intensity, $J_{\rm LW}^{\rm crit}$, to suppress $\rm H_2$ formation and
cooling. For the SED model with $N_{\rm H}=1.3\times10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$,
$8.0\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $5.0\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, we obtain
$J_{\rm LW}^{\rm crit}\approx22$, 35 and 54, all much smaller than the critical
field intensity for normal star-forming galaxies ($J_{\rm LW}^{\rm crit}\simgt
1000$). X-ray photons from previously-formed DCBHs build up a high-$z$ X-ray
background (XRB) that may boost the $J_{\rm LW}^{\rm crit}$. However, we find
that in the three SED models $J_{\rm LW}^{\rm crit}$ only increases to
$\approx80$, 170 and 390 respectively even when $\dt{\rho}_\bullet$ reaches the
maximum value allowed by the present-day XRB level ($0.22, 0.034,
0.006~M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$), still much smaller than the galactic value.
Although considering the XRB from first galaxies may further increase $J_{\rm
LW}^{\rm crit}$, we conclude that our investigation supports a scenario in
which DCBH may be more abundant than predicted by models only including
galaxies as external radiation sources.

ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral range recorded with the balloon-borne
observatory SUNRISE and state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
simulations revealed a kiloGauss magnetic field for 98% of the synthetic BPs.
Here we address the opposite question, namely which fraction of pixels hosting
kiloGauss fields coincides with an enhanced G-band brightness. We carried out
3D radiation MHD simulations for three magnetic activity levels (corresponding
to the quiet Sun, weak and strong plage) and performed a full spectral line
synthesis in the G-band. Only 7% of the kiloGauss pixels in our quiet-Sun
simulation coincide with a brightness lower than the mean quiet-Sun intensity,
while 23% of the pixels in the weak-plage simulation and even 49% in the
strong-plage simulation are associated with a local darkening. Dark
strong-field regions are preferentially found in the cores of larger flux
patches that are rare in the quiet Sun, but more common in plage regions, often
in the vertices of granulation cells. The significant brightness shortfall in
the core of larger flux patches coincide with a slight magnetic field
weakening. KiloGauss elements in the quiet Sun are on average brighter than
similar features in plage regions. Almost all strong-field pixels display a
more or less vertical magnetic field orientation. Hence in the quiet Sun,
G-band BPs correspond almost one-to-one with kiloGauss elements. In weak plage
the correspondence is still very good, but not perfect.

contributes in cosmic ray flux decrease. These substructures, shock-sheath and
magnetic cloud (MC) manifest as classical two-step Forbush decrease. The recent
work by Raghav et. al. (2016a) has shown multi-step decreases and recoveries
within shock-sheath. However, this can not be explained by ideal shock-sheath
barrier model. Further, they suggested that the local structures within the
ICME's sub-structure (MC and shock sheath) could explain this deviation of FD
profile from the classical FD. Therefore, present study attempts to investigate
the cause of multi-step cosmic ray flux decrease and their respective recovery
within shock-sheath in detail. 3D-hodogram method has been utilized to get more
details of the local structures within the shock-sheath. A 3D-hodogram method
unambiguously suggests the formation of small scale local structures within the
ICME (shock-sheath and even in MC). Moreover, the method could differentiate
the turbulent and ordered Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) regions within

with the early approaches to AI: there is no scalable way to adapt them to new
domains. Human learning solves this in part by leveraging a rich, shared,
updateable world model. Such scalability requires modularity: updating part of
the world model should not impact unrelated parts. We have argued that such
modularity will require both ""correctability"" (so that errors can be corrected
without introducing new errors) and ""interpretability"" (so that we can
understand what components need correcting).
  To achieve this, one could attempt to adapt state of the art SML systems to
be interpretable and correctable; or one could see how far the simplest
possible interpretable, correctable learning methods can take us, and try to
control the limitations of SML methods by applying them only where needed. Here
we focus on the latter approach and we investigate two main ideas: ""Teacher
Assisted Learning"", which leverages crowd sourcing to learn language; and
""Factored Dialog Learning"", which factors the process of application
development into roles where the language competencies needed are isolated,
enabling non-experts to quickly create new applications.
  We test these ideas in an ""Automated Personal Assistant"" (APA) setting, with
two scenarios: that of detecting user intent from a user-APA dialog; and that
of creating a class of event reminder applications, where a non-expert
""teacher"" can then create specific apps. For the intent detection task, we use
a dataset of a thousand labeled utterances from user dialogs with Cortana, and
we show that our approach matches state of the art SML methods, but in addition
provides full transparency: the whole (editable) model can be summarized on one

Differentiation is mostly based on binary decisions with the progenitor cells
choosing between two specific lineages. The differentiation dynamics have both
deterministic and stochastic components. Several theoretical studies suggest
that cell differentiation is a bifurcation phenomenon, well-known in dynamical
systems theory. The bifurcation point has the character of a critical point
with the system dynamics exhibiting specific features in its vicinity. These
include the critical slowing down, rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation
function, strong correlations between the fluctuations of key variables and
non-Gaussianity in the distribution of fluctuations. Recent experimental
studies provide considerable support to the idea of criticality in cell
differentiation and in other biological processes like the development of the
fruit fly embryo. In this Review, an elementary introduction is given to the
concept of criticality in cell differentiation. The correspondence between the
signatures of criticality and experimental observations on blood cell
differentiation in mice is further highlighted.

several constraints such as peak power limitation, constant envelope
transmission and discrete constellations. We study the large-system performance
of these precoders via the replica method from statistical physics, and derive
a closed-form expression for the asymptotic distortion. Our results demonstrate
that an LSE precoder with the output peak-to-average power ratio of $3~{\rm
dB}$ can track the performance of the Regularized Zero Forcing (RZF) precoder
closely. As the peak-to-average power ratio reduces to one, the constant
envelope precoder is recovered. The investigations depict that the performance
of the RZF precoder is achieved by the constant envelope precoder with $20\%$
of more transmit antennas. For $M$-PSK constellations, our analysis gives a
lower-bound on the asymptotic distortion which is tight for moderate
antenna-to-user ratios and deviates as the ratio grows. We improve this bound
by deriving the replica solution under one-step of replica symmetry breaking.
Our numerical investigations for this case show that the bound is tight for
antenna-to-user ratios less than $5$.

self-propelling droplets are initially formed by a water/ethanol mixture in a
squalane/monoolein solution, and evolve in up to three stages depending on
ethanol concentration. In the first stage, the droplet propulsion is generated
by Marangoni flow originating from the solubilization of ethanol in the oily

combination with the continuous loss of ethanol this leads to a phase
separation of the water/ethanol/monoolein mixture and the formation of Janus
droplets, i.e. a water-rich droplet connected to an ethanol-rich droplet that
is able to deliver cargo. We characterize the different evolution stages of
self-propulsion by the flow field around the droplet that evolves from a weak
pusher, over a neutral swimmer, to a dimer of neutral swimmers. Finally, we
utilize this active system to deliver DNA as a cargo. Tuning the delay time
before phase separation, by varying the chemical composition of the droplets,
several different cargo delivery processes can be programmed.

not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its

multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for
evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations.
Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct
components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the
yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population
dynamics when there are tradeoffs between phases: multiple strains can coexist
or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can
engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We
characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to
realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments.
Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput
measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy
and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the
need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial
systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.

Interactions among world countries have been widely studied at various scales,
observing economic exchanges, world history or international politics among
others. This work exhibits the potential of Wikipedia mining for such studies.
Indeed, Wikipedia stores valuable fine-grained dependencies among countries by
linking webpages together for diverse types of interactions (not only related
to economical, political or historical facts). We mine herein the Wikipedia
networks of several language editions using the recently proposed method of
reduced Google matrix analysis. This approach allows to establish direct and
hidden links between a subset of nodes that belong to a much larger directed
network. Our study concentrates on 40 major countries chosen worldwide. Our aim
is to offer a multicultural perspective on their interactions by comparing
networks extracted from five different Wikipedia language editions, emphasizing
English, Russian and Arabic ones. We demonstrate that this approach allows to
recover meaningful direct and hidden links among the 40 countries of interest.

unmanned air vehicles planning to carry radar and hyperspectral image sensors
there is going to be an abundance of such data in the recent future.
Understanding these data in real-time will be crucial in attaining some of the
important sustain- able development goals. Processing non-optical images is, in
many ways, different from that of optical images. Most of the recent advances
in the domain of image understanding has been using optical images. In this

Standard Model and play a special role in the leptogenesis framework as origin
of the baryon asymmetry in the universe. In this thesis, we develop an
effective field theory for non-relativistic Majorana particles. We apply the
effective field theory so obtained to address calculations in a hot medium
which models the early stages of the universe evolution. In particular, we
apply it to the case of a heavy Majorana neutrino decaying in a hot plasma of
Standard Model particles, whose temperature is much smaller than the mass of
the Majorana neutrino but still much larger than the electroweak scale, and the
derivation of the neutrino thermal width is revisited in an EFT fashion.
Assuming the same hierarchy between heavy neutrino masses and the temperature,
we compute systematically thermal corrections to the direct and indirect CP
asymmetries in the Majorana neutrino decays. These are key ingredients entering
the equations that describe the thermodynamic evolution of the induced
lepton-number asymmetry eventually leading to the baryon asymmetry in the
universe. We consider the case of two Majorana neutrinos with nearly degenerate
masses, that allows for a resonant enhancement of the CP asymmetry, and a
hierarchical spectrum with one heavy neutrino much lighter than the other
neutrino species. Flavour effects are also taken into account in the derivation

contribution of plasma expansion to heating of the solar corona must therefore
be assessed empirically, but this is consistent with how the J-T effect was
first identified. The sunspot record, EUV measurements by the EVE instrument on
the SDO satellite, and solar wind fluctuations documented by the ACE satellite
indicate broadly coherent periodicity from the photosphere to the outer corona
consistent with a non-pulsatory heating process. It comprises three successive
stages characterised by induction, the J-T mechanism, and plasma expansion.
Astronomical data may therefore be used to derive rather than to test an
extension of the J-T effect which could help to explain heating in other solar
system bodies and other stellar coronae.

Nuclear spins are superb quantum memories due to their long coherence times but
are difficult to be read out in single shot due to their weak interaction with
probes. Here we demonstrate single-shot readout of a weakly coupled $^{13}$C
nuclear spin, which is unresolvable in traditional protocols. We use dynamical
decoupling pulse sequences to selectively enhance the entanglement between the
nuclear spin and a nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin, tuning the weak

coupled to the NV center with strength 330 kHz is read out in 200 ms with

massive galaxies are expected to be larger in denser environments through
frequent hierarchical mergers with other galaxies. Yet, observational studies
of low-redshift early-type galaxies have shown no such trend, standing as a
puzzle to solve during the past decade. We analyzed 73,116 early-type galaxies
at $0.1\leq z < 0.15$, adopting a robust nonparametric size measurement
technique and extending the analysis to many massive galaxies. We find for the
first time that local early-type galaxies heavier than $10^{11.2}M_{\odot}$
show a clear environmental dependence in mass-size relation, in such a way that
galaxies are as much as 20-40% larger in densest environments than in
underdense environments. Splitting the sample into the brightest cluster
galaxies (BCGs) and non-BCGs does not affect the result. This result agrees
with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations and suggests that mergers played
a significant role in the growth of massive galaxies in dense environments as
expected in theory.

More and more applications with narrow latency requirements are emerging which
are not well addressed by existing proposals. In this paper we present TCP
Scalable Increase Adaptive Decrease (SIAD), a new congestion control scheme
supporting both high speed and low latency. More precisely, our algorithm aims
to provide high utilization under various networking conditions, and therefore
would allow operators to configure small buffers for low latency support. To
provide full scalability with high speed networks, we designed TCP SIAD based
on a new approach that aims for a fixed feedback rate independent of the
available bandwidth. Further, our approach provides a configuration knob for
the feedback rate. This can be used by a higher layer control loop to impact
the capacity share, potentially at the cost of higher congestion, e.g. for
applications that need a minimum rate.
  We evaluated TCP SIAD against well-known high-speed congestion control
schemes, such as Scalable TCP and High Speed TCP, as well as H-TCP that among
other goals targets small buffers. We show that only SIAD is able to utilize
the bottleneck with arbitrary buffer sizes while avoiding a standing queue.
Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity sharing of SIAD depending on the
configured feedback rate and a high robustness of TCP SIAD to non-congestion
related loss.

large to be treated atomistically. Therefore, a multiscale description, where
the molecule is treated by an ab initio approach and the metal NP by a lower

the effects of both the mutual molecule- NP time-dependent polarization and the

alter TLS behaviour. We find a sub-linear power law $\sim T^{0.4}$ in

closed system limit is at the heart of adiabatic quantum computation, but in
reality systems are always open. This motivates a natural comparison between,
on the one hand, adiabatic preparation of steady states of Lindbladian
generators and, on the other hand, relaxation towards the same steady states
subject to the final Lindbladian of the adiabatic process. In this work we thus
adopt the perspective that the goal is the most efficient possible preparation
of such steady states, rather than ground states. Using known rigorous bounds
for the open-system adiabatic theorem and for mixing times, we are then led to
a disturbing conclusion that at first appears to doom efforts to build physical
quantum annealers: relaxation seems to always converge faster than adiabatic
preparation. However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time
for Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we
show that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation.
To test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and
the relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative
quasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the
""spike"" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we
find that the answer to the ""which wins"" question depends for each model on the
temperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the ""spike""
problem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an
important role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure.
Thus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both
pure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation.

tool in this study. We present newly acquired laboratory measurements of

used in this pilot study to model the absorption by interstellar dust along the
line of sight of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 5-1. The measured
laboratory cross-sections were adapted for astrophysical data analysis and the
resulting extinction profiles of the Si K-edge were implemented in the SPEX
spectral fitting program. We derive the properties of the interstellar dust
along the line of sight by fitting the Si K-edge seen in absorption in the
spectrum of GX 5-1. We measured the hydrogen column density towards GX 5-1 to
be $3.40\pm0.1\times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$. The best fit of the silicon edge in
the spectrum of GX 5-1 is obtained by a mixture of olivine and pyroxene. In
this study, our modeling is limited to Si absorption by silicates with
different Mg:Fe ratios. We obtained an abundance of silicon in dust of
$4.0\pm0.3\times10^{-5}$ per H atom and a lower limit for total abundance,
considering both gas and dust, of $>4.4\times10^{-5}$ per H atom, which leads
to a gas to dust ratio of >0.22. Furthermore, an enhanced scattering feature in

develop a deeper understanding of biological design principles. In 2000,
Elowitz and Leibler showed that by rational design of the reaction network, and
using existing biological components, they could create a network that exhibits
periodic gene expression, dubbed the repressilator (Elowitz and Leibler,
Nature, 2000). More recently, Stricker et al. presented another synthetic
oscillator, called the dual-feedback oscillator (Stricker et al., 2008), which
is more stable. How the stability of these oscillators is affected by the
intrinsic noise of the interactions between the components and the stochastic
expression of their genes, has been studied in considerable detail. However, as
all biological oscillators reside in growing and dividing cells, an important
question is how these oscillators are perturbed by the cell cycle. In previous
work we showed that the periodic doubling of the gene copy numbers due to DNA
replication can couple not only natural, circadian oscillators to the cell
cycle (Paijmans et al., PNAS, \textbf{113}, 4063, (2016)), but also these
synthetic oscillators. Here we expand this study. We find that the strength of
the locking between oscillators depends not only on the positions of the genes
on the chromosome, but also on the noise in the timing of gene replication:
noise tends to weaken the coupling. Yet, even in the limit of high levels of
noise in the replication times of the genes, both synthetic oscillators show
clear signatures of locking to the cell cycle. This work enhances our
understanding of the design of robust biological oscillators inside growing and
diving cells.

parallel to inter-domain interfaces in the respective brush and interfacial
regions of the microdomain. Further, morphologies with anisotropically-curved
interfaces (i.e. cylinders and networks) exhibit biaxial order that is aligned

decrease of the bend resistance, $R_B$, around zero-magnetic field and the
occurrence of side-peaks in $R_B$. These features are explained as a
consequence of bump-assisted scattering of electrons towards different

of the size of the bump. Additional oscillations in $R_B$ are found in the

described by envelope functions satisfying the nonlinear Schr\""odinger

undistorted, which proves them to be true solitons as opposed to solitary waves
for which such requirement is waived. Importantly, kagome lattice supports
topological edge mode with zero group velocity unlike other types of truncated

communications, aiming at maximizing the distance of co-channel transmitters
while preserving a low latency when accessing the resources. In this paper we
analyze, with the aid of stochastic geometry, the delivery of periodic and

fading as well as the random locations of transmitting vehicles. Analytical
results include the average interference, average Binary Rate (BR), capture
probability, i.e., the probability of successful message transmission, and
Energy Efficiency (EE). Mathematical analysis reveals interesting insights
about the system performance, which are validated thought extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. In particular, it is shown that the capture probability is an
increasing function with exponential dependence with respect to the transmit
power and it is demonstrated that an arbitrary high capture probability can be
achieved, as long as the number of access resources is high enough. Finally, to
facilitate the system-level design of GLOC, the optimum transmit power is
derived, which leads to a maximal EE subject to a given constraint in the
capture probability.

an estimate for the state of small quantum systems in the laboratory. Its
application to systems with more than a few constituents (e.g. particles) soon
becomes impractical as the effort required grows exponentially in the number of
constituents. Developing more efficient techniques is particularly pressing as
precisely-controllable quantum systems that are well beyond the reach of QST
are emerging in laboratories. Motivated by this, there is a considerable
ongoing effort to develop new characterisation tools for quantum many-body
systems. Here we demonstrate Matrix Product State (MPS) tomography, which is
theoretically proven to allow the states of a broad class of quantum systems to
be accurately estimated with an effort that increases efficiently with
constituent number. We first prove that this broad class includes the
out-of-equilbrium states produced by 1D systems with finite-range interactions,
up to any fixed point in time. We then use the technique to reconstruct the
dynamical state of a trapped-ion quantum simulator comprising up to 14
entangled spins (qubits): a size far beyond the reach of QST. Our results
reveal the dynamical growth of entanglement and description complexity as
correlations spread out during a quench: a necessary condition for future
beyond-classical performance. MPS tomography should find widespread use to
study large quantum many-body systems and to benchmark and verify quantum

precisely known, so that the Gamow-Teller matrix element has been used to fit
the coupling $c_D$ of the axial-vector current to a short-range two-nucleon
pair. Because the same coupling also describes the leading one-pion-exchange
three-nucleon force, this in principle provides a very constraining fit,
uncorrelated with the $^3$H binding energy fit used to constrain another
low-energy coupling in three-nucleon forces. However, so far such $^3$H

the cutoff dependence due to the regulators in the axial-vector two-body

consequently also the extracted values for the $c_D$ coupling constant. The
degree of the cutoff dependence is correlated with the softness of the employed
NN interaction. As a result, present three-nucleon forces based on a fit to
$^3$H $\beta$ decay underestimate the uncertainty in $c_D$. We explore a range
of $c_D$ values that is compatible within cutoff variation with the

there have only been few studies that provide a comparative performance
evaluation of different systems on a common database. We have therefore set up
the LUNA16 challenge, an objective evaluation framework for automatic nodule
detection algorithms using the largest publicly available reference database of
chest CT scans, the LIDC-IDRI data set. In LUNA16, participants develop their
algorithm and upload their predictions on 888 CT scans in one of the two
tracks: 1) the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system
should be developed, or 2) the false positive reduction track where a provided
set of nodule candidates should be classified. This paper describes the setup
of LUNA16 and presents the results of the challenge so far. Moreover, the
impact of combining individual systems on the detection performance was also
investigated. It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional
networks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of
these solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 1.0
false positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms
to improve the detection performance. Our observer study with four expert
readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by
expert readers who originally annotated the LIDC-IDRI data. We released this
set of additional nodules for further development of CAD systems.

application of the tensor product of operations. The tensor product is linearly
extended to act synchronously across the entire entangled system. When
simulating an entangled system, the conventional approach is possible and
practical if both parts of the entangled system exist within the same physical
simulator. However, if we wish to simulate an entangled system across a
distributed network, sending half of the entangled pair to another simulator on
another computer system, the synchronous approach becomes difficult. In the
first part of this paper, we demonstrate a method of simulating operations on
entangled states in a distributed environment which is equivalent to the
conventional approach. The advantage to our approach is that we can simulate
distributed quantum systems on physically distributed hardware. Such a system
advances the possibilities of demonstrating distributed quantum algorithms for
research, teaching, and learning.
  Further, the security of quantum key exchange depends on successfully
detecting the presence of an eavesdropper. In most cases this is done by
comparing the errors introduced by an eavesdropper with the channel error rate.
In other words, the communicating parties must tolerate some errors without
losing a significant amount of key information. In the second part of this
paper, we characterize the effects of amplitude damping errors on quantum key
distribution protocols and explore allowable tolerances. Through simulations we
observe that the effect of these errors, in some cases, is highly dependent on
where the eavesdropper is located on the channel.

shown from many studies that sleeping and waking environment, waking time and
hours of sleep is of very significant importance which can result in sleeping
disorders and variety of diseases. This paper finds the sleep cycle of an
individual and according changes the ambient temperature to maximize his/her
sleep efficiency. We suggest a method which will assist in increasing sleep
efficiency. Using Fast-Fourier-Transformation (FFT) of heart rate signals to
extract heart rate variability data such that low frequency / high frequency
(LF/HF) power ratio we are detecting sleep stages using an automated algorithm
and then applying feedback mechanism to alter the ambient temperature depending
upon the sleep stage.

  2016",,"10.1142/S2010194517600266",,"nucl-th astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compute models for the equation of state (EoS) of the matter in the cores
of hybrid stars. Hadronic matter is treated in the non-linear relativistic
mean-field approximation, and quark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and
non-local Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions.
The transition from hadronic to quark matter is constructed by considering
either a soft phase transition (Gibbs construction) or a sharp phase transition
(Maxwell construction). We find that high-mass neutron stars with masses up to
$2.1-2.4 M_\odot$ may contain a mixed phase with hadrons and quarks in their
cores, if global charge conservation is imposed via the Gibbs conditions.
However, if the Maxwell conditions is considered, the appearance of a pure
quark matter core either destabilizes the star immediately (commonly for
non-local NJL models) or leads to a very short hybrid star branch in the
mass-radius relation (generally for local NJL models).

  during a given time?","7 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We determine the probability $P$ of two independent events $A$ and $B$, which
occur randomly $n_A$ and $n_B$ times during a total time $T$ and last for $t_A$
and $t_B$, to occur simultaneously at some point during $T$. Therefore we first
prove the precise equation \begin{equation*} P^* = \dfrac{t_A+t_B}{T} -
\dfrac{t_A^2+t_B^2}{2T^2} \end{equation*} for the case $n_A = n_B = 1$ and
continue to establish a simple approximation equation \begin{equation*} P
\approx 1 - \left( 1 - n_A \dfrac{t_A + t_B}{T} \right)^{n_B} \end{equation*}
for any given value of $n_A$ and $n_B$. Finally we prove the more complex
universal equation \begin{equation*} P = 1 - \dfrac{ \left( T^+ - t_A n_A - t_B
n_B \right)^{n_A + n_B} }{ \left( T^+ - t_A n_A \right)^{n_A} \left( T^+ - t_B
n_B \right)^{n_B} } \pm E^\pm, \end{equation*} which yields the probability for
$A$ and $B$ to overlap at some point for any given parameter, with $T^+ := T +
\frac{t_A + t_B}{2}$ and a small error term $E^\pm$.

the role of energy in the theory of gravitation and provide a formulation of
gravity which takes into account the quantum nature of the source. We show that
gravity depends dramatically on the entanglement present between the
constituents of the Universe. Applications of the theory and open questions are
also discussed.

the help of the fundamental constants $\hbar, c, G$. The functional role of the
constants used for the construction of Planck units is different. If the first
two of them represent the limits of the action and the speed of light and
underlie quantum mechanics and special relativity, the Newton's constant $G$
""only"" fixes the absolute value of the gravitational forces. It seems natural
to make a set of fundamental constants more consistent and more effective if
used to build Planck units only limit values. To this end, in addition to the
limit values $\hbar $ and $c$ we introduce an additional limit value - a
maximum power in nature. On the basis of these values, a modification of the
Planck unit system is proposed. The proposed modification leaves unchanged the
numerical values of Planck units, however, opens up exciting new possibilities
for interpreting the known results and for obtaining new ones.

towards another vacuum is a necessary condition for the model to be

of the theory, the decay rate is significantly suppressed compared to that of
the Standard Model. We also discuss properties of a tunneling solution that are
specific to the Higgs-Dilaton theory.

${\bar \Lambda}_c^ - \Lambda_c^+$ production vertex is described by the

incident antiproton with one of the protons of the target nucleus. The
$\Lambda_c^+$ bound state spinors as well as the self-energies of the exchanged

model. The parameters of various vertices are taken to be the same as those
used in our previous study of the elementary ${\bar p} + p \to {\bar

of interest to the ${\bar P}ANDA$ experiment, the 0$^\circ$ differential cross
sections for the formation of $^{16}_{\Lambda_c^+}$O hypernuclear states with
simple particle-hole configurations, have magnitudes in the range of a few
