restriction, resulting in a sequence of many highly inaccurate (weak) von
Neumann measurements, is not sufficiently strong to ensure proximity between a
readout and the Feynman paths along which the monitored system evolves. Rather,
in the continuous limit, the variations of a typical readout become much larger
than the separation between the eigenvalues of the measured quantity. Thus, a
typical readout is not represented by a nearly constant curve, correlating with
one of the eigenvalues of the measured quantity $\a$, even when decoherence, or
Zeno effect are achieved for the observed two-level system, and does not point
directly to the system's final state. We show that the decoherence in a ""free""
system can be seen as induced by a Gaussian random walk with a drift,
eventually directing the system towards one of the eigenstates of $\a$. A
similar mechanism appears to be responsible for the Zeno effect in a driven
system, when its Rabi oscillations are quenched by monitoring. Alongside the
Gaussian case, which can only be studied numerically, we also consider a fully
tractable model with a ""hard wall"" restriction, and show the results to be

from Hassan et al. (2016) to include time-integrated ionisation and
recombination effects, and find that this leads to more sudden reionisation. It
also yields larger HII bubbles which leads to an order of magnitude more 21cm
power on large scales, while suppressing the small scale ionization power.
Local fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen density play the dominant role in
boosting the 21cm power spectrum on large scales, while recombinations are
subdominant. We use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to constrain our model
to observations of the star formation rate functions at z = 6,7,8 from Bouwens
et al. (2015), the Planck (2016) optical depth measurements, and the Becker &
Bolton (2013) ionising emissivity data at z~5. We then use this constrained
model to perform 21cm forecasting for LOFAR, HERA, and SKA in order to
determine how well such data can characterise the sources driving reionisation.
We find that the 21cm power spectrum alone can somewhat constrain the halo mass
dependence of ionising sources, the photon escape fraction and ionising
amplitude, but combining the 21cm data with other current observations enables
us to separately constrain all these parameters. Our framework illustrates how
21cm data can play a key role in understanding the sources and topology of

perpendicular electron heat transport inside the separatrix of a magnetic
island chain associated with a neoclassical tearing mode in a tokamak plasma,
due to the flattening of the electron temperature profile in this region, on
the overall stability of the mode. The onset of the neoclassical tearing mode
is governed by the ratio of the divergences of the parallel and perpendicular
electron heat fluxes in the vicinity of the island chain. By increasing the
degree of transport reduction, the onset of the mode, as the divergence ratio
is gradually increased, can be made more and more abrupt. Eventually, when the
degree of transport reduction passes a certain critical value, the onset of the
neoclassical tearing mode becomes discontinuous. In other words, when some
critical value of the divergence ratio is reached, there is a sudden
bifurcation to a branch of neoclassical tearing mode solutions. Moreover, once

air pollution during pregnancy and adverse children's health outcomes. Advances
in exposure assessment and statistics allow for estimation of both critical
windows of vulnerability and exposure effect heterogeneity. Simultaneous
estimation of windows of vulnerability and effect heterogeneity can be
accomplished by fitting a distributed lag model (DLM) stratified by subgroup.
However, this can provide an incomplete picture of how effects vary across
subgroups because it does not allow for subgroups to have the same window but
different within-window effects or to have different windows but the same
within-window effect. Because the timing of some developmental processes are
common across subpopulations of infants while for others the timing differs
across subgroups, both scenarios are important to consider when evaluating
health risks of prenatal exposures. We propose a new approach that partitions
the DLM into a constrained functional predictor that estimates windows of
vulnerability and a scalar effect representing the within-window effect
directly. The proposed method allows for heterogeneity in only the window, only
the within-window effect, or both. In a simulation study we show that a model
assuming a shared component across groups results in lower bias and mean
squared error for the estimated windows and effects when that component is in
fact constant across groups. We apply the proposed method to estimate windows
of vulnerability in the association between prenatal exposures to fine
particulate matter and each of birth weight and asthma incidence, and estimate
how these associations vary by sex and maternal obesity status, in a
Boston-area prospective pre-birth cohort study.

perform primary frequency control with gird-connected inverters that improves
the network dynamic performance. The work is motivated by the dynamic
degradation experienced by the power grid due to the increase in asynchronous
inverted-based generation. We show that the widely suggested virtual inertia
solution suffers from unbounded noise amplification (infinite $\mathcal H_2$
norm) when measurement noise is considered. This suggests that virtual inertia
could potentially further degrade the grid performance once broadly deployed.
  This motivates the proposed solution in this paper that overcomes the
limitations of virtual inertia controllers while sharing the same advantages of
traditional droop control. In particular, our iDroop controllers are
decentralized, rebalance supply and demand, and provide power sharing.
Furthermore, our solution can improve the dynamic performance without affecting
the steady state solution. Our algorithm can be incrementally deployed and can
be guaranteed to be stable using a decentralized sufficient stability condition

fractions within the central half-light radius of 258 early-type galaxies,
using data from the volume-limited ATLAS$^{\mathrm{3D}}$ survey. We use three
distinct sets of dynamical models, which vary in their assumptions and also
allow for spatial variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio, to test the
robustness of our results. We confirm that the slopes of the total mass
profiles are approximately isothermal, and investigate how the total-mass slope
depends on various galactic properties. The most statistically-significant
correlations we find are a function of either surface density, \(\Sigma_e\), or
velocity dispersion, \(\sigma_e\). However there is evidence for a break in the
latter relation, with a nearly universal logarithmic slope above
\(\log_{10}[\sigma_e/(\si{km~s^{-1}})]\sim 2.1\) and a steeper trend below this
value. For the 142 galaxies above that critical \(\sigma_e\) value, the total
mass-density logarithmic slopes have a mean value
\(\left\langle\gamma^\prime\right\rangle = -2.192 \pm 0.016\) (\(1\sigma\)
error) with an observed rms scatter of only \(\sigma_{\gamma^\prime}=0.167 \pm
0.016\). Considering the observational errors, we estimate an intrinsic scatter
of \(\sigma_{\gamma^\prime}^\mathrm{intr} \approx 0.15\). These values are
broadly consistent with those found by strong lensing studies at similar radii
and agree, within the tight errors, with values recently found at much larger
radii via stellar dynamics or HI rotation curves (using significantly smaller
samples than this work).

combinations of the actuation frequencies, where the first-order includes the
$2\omega_1,2\omega_2,\omega_1+\omega_2$, and $\omega_1-\omega_2$ harmonics. For

discuss nonequilibrium effects. Due to the slow quark chemical equilibration in
BAMPS, the yield is lower than the results from other groups; in turn we see a
strong effect from scatterings of energetic jet-like partons with the medium.
This nonequilibrium photon production can dominate the thermal emission, such
that the spectra are harder and the photonic elliptic flow of the quark-gluon

structure proposed in a recent contribution relies on ad-hoc definitions of

join-irreducible elements distinct from atoms. Conversely, here embedded
subsets obtain through a closure operator defined over the product of the
subset and partition lattices, where elements are generic pairs of a subset and
a partition. Those such pairs that coincide with their closure are precisely
embedded subsets, and since the Steinitz exchange axiom is also satisfied, what
results is a geometric (hence atomic) lattice given by a simple matroid (or
combinatorial geometry) included in the product of the subset and partition
lattices (as the partition lattice itself is the polygon matroid defined on the
edges of a complete graph). By focusing on its M\""obius function, this
geometric lattice of embedded subsets of a n-set is shown to be isomorphic to
the lattice of partitions of a n+1-set.

Kohn-Sham orbitals are either fully occupied or unoccupied, the physics of the
fractional quantum Hall effect calls for fractionally occupied Kohn-Sham
orbitals. This has necessitated averaging over an ensemble of Slater
determinants to obtain meaningful results. We develop an alternative approach
in which we express and minimize the grand canonical potential in terms of the
composite fermion variables. This provides a natural resolution of the
fractional-occupation problem because the fully occupied orbitals of composite
fermions automatically correspond to fractionally occupied orbitals of
electrons. We demonstrate the quantitative validity of our approach by
evaluating the density profile of fractional Hall edge as a function of
temperature and the distance from the delta dopant layer and showing that it
reproduces edge reconstruction in the expected parameter region.

characterization algorithms into a feedback based closed-loop control system

characterization methods that use PIV realizations for the purpose of a
real-time (online or on-the-fly) feedback-based control. Both methods can
extract centers and strengths of streamwise vortices generated behind active
vortex generators in a turbulent boundary layer flow, and we show how to
integrate those in a closed-loop control strategy. For demonstration purposes
we use stereoscopic PIV measurements at the wind tunnel facility obtained in
the transverse-wall-normal plane behind active vortex generators. A robust
algorithm is using the $Q$-criteria and the integration of vorticity of each
extracted vortex. Results show that a moving window average of a small number
of instantaneous fields is nevertheless needed for increased robustness. The
robust method requires the full field PIV computation followed by spatial
derivatives calculations. A faster method is developed, which, using only
horizontal lines of vertical velocity, has a high potential to significantly
cut down the computational effort relative to the robust method. We compare the
two methods and discuss their shortcomings and the potential for the real-time,

$\xi^{\alpha}$ that is time-like and hypersurface orthogonal on one side of the

side of the surface. It has been argued that the surface is null if
$\xi_{\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}\rightarrow 0$ as the surface is approached from the
static region. This implies that, in a coordinate system adapted to $\xi$,
surfaces with $g_{tt}=0$ are null. In spherically symmetric space-times the
condition $g^{rr}=0$ instead of $g_{tt}=0$ is sometimes used to locate null
surfaces.
  In this paper I examine the arguments that lead to these two different
criteria and show that both arguments are incorrect. A surface $\xi=$ constant
has a normal vector whose norm is proportional to $\xi_{\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}$.
This lead to the conclusion that surfaces with $\xi_{\alpha}\xi^{\alpha}=0$ are
null. However, the proportionality factor generally diverges when $g_{tt}=0$,
leading to a different condition for the norm to be null. In static spherically
symmetric space-times this condition gives $g^{rr}=0$, not $g_{tt}=0$.
  The problem with the condition $g^{rr}=0$ is that the coordinate system is
singular on the surface. One can either use a nonsingular coordinate system or
examine the induced metric on the surface to determine if it is null. By using
these approaches it is shown that the correct criteria is $g_{tt}=0$. I also
examine the condition required for the surface to be nonsingular.

$\Delta\geq 2$, the Shearer threshold is the value
$\lambda^*(\Delta)=(\Delta-1)^{\Delta-1}/\Delta^{\Delta}$ . It is known that
for $\lambda < - \lambda^*(\Delta)$, there are graphs~$G$ with maximum
degree~$\Delta$ whose independent set polynomial, evaluated at~$\lambda$, is at
most~$0$. Also, there are no such graphs for any $\lambda >
-\lambda^*(\Delta)$. This paper is motivated by the computational problem of
approximating the independent set polynomial when $\lambda < -
\lambda^*(\Delta)$. The key issue in complexity bounds for this problem is
""implementation"". Informally, an implementation of a real number $\lambda'$ is
a graph whose hard-core partition function, evaluated at~$\lambda$, simulates a
vertex-weight of~$\lambda'$ in the sense that $\lambda'$ is the ratio between
the contribution to the partition function from independent sets containing a
certain vertex and the contribution from independent sets that do not contain
that vertex. Implementations are the cornerstone of intractability results for
the problem of approximately evaluating the independent set polynomial. Our
main result is that, for any $\lambda < - \lambda^*(\Delta)$, it is possible to
implement a set of values that is dense over the reals. The result is tight in
the sense that it is not possible to implement a set of values that is dense
over the reals for any $\lambda> \lambda^*(\Delta)$. Our result has already
been used in a paper with \bezakova{} (STOC 2018) to show that it is \#P-hard

observing it from an exocentric view, and vice versa. This allows models to

Ashkin-Teller model at the Baxter line by performing time-dependent Monte Carlo
Simulations. First, as preparatory results, we obtain the critical parameters
by searching the optimal power law decay of the magnetization. Thus, the
dynamic critical exponents $\theta _{m}$ and $\theta _{p}$, related to the
magnetic and electric order parameters, as well as the persistence exponent
$\theta _{g}$, are estimated using heat-bath Monte Carlo simulations. In
addition, we estimate the dynamic exponent $z$ and the static critical
exponents $\beta $ and $\nu $ for both order parameters. We propose a refined
method to estimate the static exponents that considers two different averages:
one that combines an internal average using several seeds with another which is
taken over geographic variations in the power laws. Moreover, we also performed
the bootstrapping method for a complementary analysis. Our results show that
the ratio $\beta /\nu $ exhibits universal behavior along the critical line
corroborating the conjecture for both magnetization and polarization.

the brain, $\textit{in vivo}$, by measuring water diffusion along angular
gradient directions in q-space. High angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI) can produce better estimates of fiber orientation than the popularly
used diffusion tensor imaging, but the high number of samples needed to
estimate diffusivity requires longer patient scan times. To accelerate dMRI,
compressed sensing (CS) has been utilized by exploiting a sparse dictionary
representation of the data, discovered through sparse coding. The sparser the
representation, the fewer samples are needed to reconstruct a high resolution
signal with limited information loss, and so an important area of research has
focused on finding the sparsest possible representation of dMRI. Current
reconstruction methods however, rely on an angular representation $\textit{per
voxel}$ with added spatial regularization, and so, for non-zero signals, one is
required to have at least one non-zero coefficient per voxel. This means that
the global level of sparsity must be greater than the number of voxels. In
contrast, we propose a joint spatial-angular representation of dMRI that will
allow us to achieve levels of global sparsity that are below the number of
voxels. A major challenge, however, is the computational complexity of solving
a global sparse coding problem over large-scale dMRI. In this work, we present
novel adaptations of popular sparse coding algorithms that become better suited
for solving large-scale problems by exploiting spatial-angular separability.
Our experiments show that our method achieves significantly sparser
representations of HARDI than is possible by the state of the art.

$x_0 = 1$ and $g$ is any primitive root of $p$, a pseudorandom number heuristic
suggests that they are, in fact, unpredictable. Moreover, one type of
cryptography makes use of discrete algorithms, which depends on the difficulty
of solving $a = g^n$ for $n$ given $a$ and $g$. This suggests that the squares,
which are exactly the even powers of $g$, are hard to identify. On the other
hand, the Legendre symbol, $(a/p)$, which equals $1$ if a is a square modulo
$p$ and $-1$ otherwise, has proven patterns. For example, $(ab/p) = (a/p)(b/p)$
holds true, and this shows that squares modulo $p$ have some structure. This
paper considers the randomness of the following sequence: $(1/p), (2/p), ...,
((p-1)/p)$. Because it consists of binary data, the runs test is applied, which
suggests that the number of runs is exactly (p-1)/2. This turns out to be a

adaptive video streaming algorithms based on index based policies (dubbed
DAS-IP) to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE) provided to clients using
video streaming services. Due to the distributed nature of our algorithm, it is
easily implementable.
  We begin by considering the simplest set-up of a one-hop wireless network in
which an Access Point (AP) transmits video packets to multiple clients over a
shared unreliable channel. The video file meant for each client has been
fragmented into several packets, and the server maintains multiple copies (each
of different quality) of the same video file. Clients maintain individual
packet buffers in order to mitigate the effect of uncertainty on video
iterruption. Streaming experience, or the Quality of Experience (QoE) of a
client depends on several factors: i) starvation/outage probability, i.e.,
average time duration for which the client does not play video because the
buffer is empty, ii) average video quality, iii) average number of starvation
periods, iv) temporal variations in video quality etc.
  We pose the problem of making dynamic streaming decisions in order to
maximize the total QoE as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). A
consideration of the associated dual MDP suggests us that the problem is vastly
simplified if the AP is allowed to charge a price per unit bandwidth usage from
the clients. More concretely, a ""client-by-client"" QoE optimization leads to
the networkwide QoE maximization, and thus provides us a decentralized
streaming algorithm.
  This enables the clients to themselves decide the optimal streaming choices
in each time-slot, and yields us a much desired client-level adaptation
algorithm. The optimal policy has an appealing simple threshold structure.

Moreover, we consider the virialization of the overdense region in the models
after they detach from the background expanding universe and turn around to
collapse. We find that there are constraints in the magnitude and occurring
epoch of the initial perturbation. The existence of these constraints indicates
that a perturbation that is too weak or occurs too late will not be able to
stop the expanding of the overdense region. The illustration of the evolution
of the perturbation shows that in $f(T)$ gravities, the initial perturbation
within the constraints can eventually lead to clustering and form structure.
The evolution also shows that nonminimal coupling models collapse slower than
the minimal coupling one.

polarized modes of radio pulsar emission via the covariances between the Stokes
parameters. To accommodate the typically heavy-tailed distributions of
single-pulse radio flux density, the fourth-order joint cumulants of the
electric field are used to describe the superposition of modes with arbitrary
probability distributions. The framework is used to consider the distinction
between superposed and disjoint modes with particular attention to the effects
of integration over finite samples. If the interval over which the polarization
state is estimated is longer than the timescale for switching between two or
more disjoint modes of emission, then the modes are unresolved by the
instrument. The resulting composite sample mean exhibits properties that have
been attributed to mode superposition, such as depolarization. Because the
distinction between disjoint modes and a composite sample of unresolved
disjoint modes depends on the temporal resolution of the observing
instrumentation, the arguments in favour of superposed modes of pulsar emission
are revisited and observational evidence for disjoint modes is described. In
principle, the four-dimensional covariance matrix that describes the
distribution of sample mean Stokes parameters can be used to distinguish
between disjoint modes, superposed modes, and a composite sample of unresolved
disjoint modes. More comprehensive and conclusive interpretation of the
covariance matrix requires more detailed consideration of various relevant
phenomena, including temporally correlated subpulse modulation (e.g. jitter),
statistical dependence between modes (e.g. covariant intensities and partial
coherence), and multipath propagation effects (e.g. scintillation and
scattering). Unpublished supplementary material is appended after the

surface evolution of Cd3As2 under high pressure through magnetotransport. A
sudden change in Berry phase occurs at 1.3 GPa along with the unanticipated
shrinkage of the Fermi surface, which occurs well below the structure
transition point (~2.5 GPa). High pressure X-ray diffraction also reveals an
anisotropic compression of the Cd3As2 lattice around a similar pressure.
Corroborated by the first-principles calculations we show that an axial
compression will shift the Dirac nodes towards the Brillouin zone center and
eventually introduces a finite energy gap. The ability to tune the node
position, a vital parameter of Dirac semimetals, can have dramatic impacts on
the corresponding topological properties such as the Fermi arc surface states
and the chiral anomaly. Our study demonstrates axial compression as an
efficient approach for manipulating the band topology and exploring the

processes and are of much interest as drug targets. In contrast to the
availability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ
folding.
  Scope of review: We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies
of the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We
explain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to
study unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss
the potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in
the folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally
different from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best
described by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between
at least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different
conformational ensembles.
  Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain
experiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of
long-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the
free energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences
to populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme
complexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of
the folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective
variables.
  General significance: We reconcile available computational and experimental
studies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding
landscapes

Umbrella Sampling and Histogram Re-weighting, we study the phase diagram of a
system of dumbbells formed by two touching spheres having variable sizes, as
well as different interaction properties. The first sphere ($h$) interacts with
all other spheres belonging to different dumbbells with a hard-sphere
potential. The second sphere ($s$) interacts via a square-well interaction with
other $s$ spheres belonging to different dumbbells and with a hard-sphere
potential with all remaining $h$ spheres. We focus on the region where the $s$
sphere is larger than the $h$ sphere, as measured by a parameter $1\le
\alpha\le 2 $ controlling the relative size of the two spheres.
  As $\alpha \to 2$ a simple fluid of square-well spheres is recovered, whereas
$\alpha \to 1$ corresponds to the Janus dumbbell limit, where the $h$ and $s$
spheres have equal sizes. Many phase diagrams falling into three classes are
observed, depending on the value of $\alpha$. The $1.8 \le \alpha \le 2$ is
dominated by a gas-liquid phase separation very similar to that of a pure
square-well fluid with varied critical temperature and density. When $1.3 \le
\alpha \le 1.8$ we find a progressive destabilization of the gas-liquid phase
diagram by the onset of self-assembled structures, that eventually lead to a
metastability of the gas-liquid transition below $\alpha=1.2$.

formulation of Clausen (2013) is used in the context of the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the simulation of incompressible fluids.
Traditionally, weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) formulations have employed
artificial compressiblity to simulate incompressible fluids. EDAC is an
alternative to the artificial compressiblity scheme wherein a pressure
evolution equation is solved in lieu of coupling the fluid density to the
pressure by an equation of state. The method is explicit and is easy to
incorporate into existing SPH solvers using the WCSPH formulation. This is
demonstrated by coupling the EDAC scheme with the recently proposed Transport
Velocity Formulation (TVF) of Adami et al. (2013). The method works for both
internal flows and for flows with a free surface (a drawback of the TVF
scheme). Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the proposed
scheme and it is found that the EDAC scheme gives results that are as good or
sometimes better than those produced by the TVF or standard WCSPH. The scheme
is robust and produces smooth pressure distributions and does not require the
use of an artificial viscosity in the momentum equation although using some
artificial viscosity is beneficial.

its sublattice symmetry. In bilayers, it is possible to open gaps as large as
0.2 eV. However, these gaps rarely lead to a highly insulating state expected
for such semiconductors at low temperatures. This long-standing puzzle is
usually explained by charge inhomogeneity. Here we investigate spatial
distributions of proximity-induced superconducting currents in gapped graphene
and, also, compare measurements in the Hall bar and Corbino geometries in the
normal state. By gradually opening the gap in bilayer graphene, we find that
the supercurrent at the charge neutrality point changes from uniform to such
that it propagates along narrow stripes near graphene edges. Similar stripes
are found in gapped monolayers. These observations are corroborated by using
the ""edgeless"" Corbino geometry in which case resistivity at the neutrality
point increases exponentially with increasing the gap, as expected for an
ordinary semiconductor. This is in contrast to the Hall bar geometry where
resistivity measured under similar conditions saturates to values of only about
a few resistance quanta. We attribute the metallic-like edge conductance to a

Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the
hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along
the lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show
that there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with
sampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a
statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.
Compared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk
directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being
sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new
algorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates
in polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known
algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of
Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of
the form ""if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH
collapses""--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson
and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant
versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities.
Fifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work
implies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to
such oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP
is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles.

by the Mie theory to validate the accuracy of the developed nonlinear solver.
The SFG from a multi-resonant nanoantenna (MR-NA) and the SHG from a

MR-NA and gap plasmonic mode of the PIC-NA are observed. Unidirectional
nonlinear radiation for the PIC-NA is realized. Moreover, its emission

bound for each component function exhibits an interplay between the
dimensionality and sparsity of the parametric component and the smoothness of
the relevant nonparametric component. Indeed, the minimax risk for smooth

that penalized least square estimators can nearly achieve minimax lower bounds.

suffer from the gamma factor blow up of the usual time-independent AdS/CFT
heavy quark setup and is qualitatively similar to, but differs by
$\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor from, the light flavor result of Liu, Rajagopal,
and Wiedemann. Our findings can be immediately implemented into any
$\hat{q}$-based energy loss model.
  Our $\hat{q}$ derivation relies on our calculation of the average distance
squared, $s^2(t)$, travelled by the endpoint of a string falling in an
AdS$_3$-Schwarzschild spacetime. The early time behavior is ballistic,
$s^2(t)\sim t^2$, but the late time behavior is the usual diffusive Brownian
motion, $s^2(t)\sim t$. These late time dynamics are universal and depend only
on the near-horizon physics, which allows us to generalize our results to
arbitrary dimensions and thus make contact with the physics explored by RHIC
and LHC.
  Additionally, we find that AdS/CFT predicts angular ordering for radiation in
medium, just as in vacuum, and in contradistinction to weak-coupling, with its
anti-angular ordering prediction. Finally, our results also imply, sensibly,
that AdS/CFT predicts a smooth interpolation between the angular correlations
of open heavy flavor and light flavor observables.

perimeter intersections (i.e. to minimize local delay) into the perimeter
control scheme (i.e. to optimize traffic performance at the network level).
This is a complex control problem rarely explored in the literature. In
particular, modeling the interaction between the network level control and the
local level control has not been fully considered. Utilizing the Macroscopic
Fundamental Diagram (MFD) as the traffic performance indicator, we formulate a
dynamic system model, and design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based
controller coupling two competing control objectives and optimizing the
performance at the local and the network level as a whole. To solve this highly
non-linear optimization problem, we employ an approximation framework, enabling
the optimal solution of this large-scale problem to be feasible and efficient.
Numerical analysis shows that by applying the proposed controller, the
protected network can operate around the desired state as expressed by the MFD,
while the total delay at the perimeter is minimized as well. Moreover, the
paper sheds light on the robustness of the proposed controller. This
multi-scale hybrid controller is further extended to a stochastic MPC scheme,
where connected vehicles (CV) serve as the only data source. Hence, low
penetration rates of CVs lead to strong noises in the controller. This is a
first attempt to develop a network-level traffic control methodology by using
the emerging CV technology. We consider the stochasticity in traffic state
estimation and the shape of the MFD. Simulation analysis demonstrates the
robustness of the proposed stochastic controller, showing that efficient
controllers can indeed be designed with this newly-spread vehicle technology
even in the absence of other data collection schemes (e.g. loop detectors).

for the immersed boundary method to link the Lagrangian and Eulerian variables

ventricle of the heart. Our tests include cases in which, for a fixed Eulerian
grid spacing, coarser Lagrangian structural meshes yield discretization errors
that are as much as several orders of magnitude smaller than errors obtained
using finer structural meshes. The Lagrangian-Eulerian coupling approach
developed in this work enables the effective use of these coarse structural
meshes with the immersed boundary method. This work also contrasts two
different weak forms of the equations, one of which is demonstrated to be more
effective for the coarse structural discretizations facilitated by our coupling

oscillators coupled indirectly via a dynamical environment. Essentially, the
environment by which the individual elements communicate is heterogeneous.
Nevertheless, most of previous works considered the homogeneous case only.
Here, we investigated the dynamical behaviors in a population of spatially
distributed chaotic oscillators immersed in a heterogeneous environment.
Various dynamical synchronization states such as oscillation death, phase
synchronization, and complete synchronized oscillation as well as their
transitions were found. More importantly, we uncovered a non-traditional quorum
sensing transition: increasing the density would first lead to collective
oscillation from oscillation quench, but further increasing the population
density would lead to degeneration from complete synchronization to phase
synchronization or even from phase synchronization to desynchronization. The
underlying mechanism of this finding was attributed to the dual roles played by
the population density. Further more, by treating the indirectly coupled
systems effectively to the system with directly local coupling, we applied the
master stability function approach to predict the occurrence of the complete
synchronized oscillation, which were in agreement with the direct numerical
simulations of the full system. The possible candidates of the experimental
realization on our model was also discussed.

the distinct merit of which is that it does not need accurate control over the

application in quantum computation, due to the limited coherent times of
typical quantum systems. Here, we propose a scheme to implement quantum state
conversion in opto-electro-mechanical systems via shortcut to adiabaticity,
where the process can be greatly speeded up while the precise timing control is
still not necessary. In our scheme, only by modifying the coupling strength, we
can achieve fast quantum state conversion with high fidelity, where the
adiabatic condition does not need to be met. In addition, the population of the
unwanted intermediate state can be further suppressed. Therefore, our protocol
presents an important step towards practical state conversion between optical
and microwave photons, and thus may find many important applications in hybrid
quantum information processing.

frequency locked to an applied radio frequency (rf) electric field. Over time,
frequency locking stabilizes the nanoplatelet so that its axis of rotation is
normal to the nanoplatelet and perpendicular to the rf electric field. We
observe that residual slow dynamics of the direction of the axis of rotation in
the plane normal to the rf electric field are determined by an applied magnetic
field. We present a simple model that accurately describes our observations.
From our data and model we can infer both a diamagnetic polarizability and a
magnetic moment proportional to the frequency of rotation, which we compare to
theoretical values. Our results establish that trapping technologies have
applications for materials measurements at the nanoscale.

such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are directly applicable to perform

that inference in this probabilistic model automatically leads to a feedback

serious candidate for the implementation of large-scale quantum circuits.
Excellent scalability is often argued for spin qubits defined by lithography
and controlled via electrical signals, based on the success of conventional
semiconductor integrated circuits. However, the wiring and interconnect
requirements for quantum circuits are completely different from those for
classical circuits, as individual DC, pulsed and in some cases microwave
control signals need to be routed from external sources to every qubit. This is
further complicated by the requirement that these spin qubits currently operate
at temperatures below 100 mK. Here we review several strategies that are
considered to address this crucial challenge in scaling quantum circuits based
on electron spin qubits. Key assets of spin qubits include the potential to
operate at 1 to 4 K, the high density of quantum dots or donors combined with
possibilities to space them apart as needed, the extremely long spin coherence
times, and the rich options for integration with classical electronics based on
the same technology.
