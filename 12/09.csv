have shown promising results in cancer prognosis and treatment. Regardless of
tumor type, trials that match patients to targeted therapies for their

adaptive Bayesian clinical trial design for patient allocation and

finding methods are that we allow for variable sets of covariates to be

interactions of covariates, and the adaptive allocation of each patient to
treatment arms using the posterior predictive probability of which arm is best
for each patient. The new method is demonstrated via extensive simulation

an adaptive transformation to map these features into the ground-level

the semantic segmentation predicted solely based on the aerial image. We show
that a model learned using this strategy, with no additional training, is
already capable of rough semantic labeling of aerial imagery. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that by finetuning this model we can achieve more accurate semantic

elongatus is a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins,
KaiA, KaiB and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of
two domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the
CII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.
While this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven
thermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental
observations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we
present a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of
the clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain
provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between
an active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise
and an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII
domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also
naturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can
stimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA
for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order
of KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,
the release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state
of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only
stabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and
hence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo
algorithm, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.

where the MCA enhancement is achieved when electrons are accumulated at the Fe

Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) that is able to estimate the first-light time of
SNe~Ia, even when they are not discovered extremely early. With an improved
ability to estimate the time of first light for SNe Ia, we compute the rise
times for a sample of 56 well-observed SNe~Ia. We find rise times ranging from
10.5 to 20.5 days, with a mean of 16.0 days, and confirm that the rise time is
generally correlated with the decline rate $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, but with large
scatter. The rise time could be an additional parameter to help classify SN~Ia
subtypes.

problem was found; it was shown to give rise to a new nonlocal $PT$ symmetric
and integrable Hamiltonian nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) equation.
Subsequently, the inverse scattering transform was constructed for the case of
rapidly decaying initial data and a family of spatially localized, time
periodic one soliton solution were found. In this paper, the inverse scattering
transform for the nonlocal NLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions at
infinity is presented in the four cases when the data at infinity have constant
amplitudes. The direct and inverse scattering problems are analyzed.
Specifically, the direct problem is formulated, the analytic properties of the
eigenfunctions and scattering data and their symmetries are obtained. The
inverse scattering problem is developed via a left-right Riemann-Hilbert
problem in terms of a suitable uniformization variable and the time dependence
of the scattering data is obtained. This leads to a method to linearize/solve
the Cauchy problem. Pure soliton solutions are discussed and explicit 1-soliton
solution and two 2-soliton solutions are provided for three of the four
different cases corresponding to two different signs of nonlinearity and two
different values of the phase difference between plus and minus infinity. In
the one other case there are no solitons.

  (WiMAX) Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-aware cross
layer scheduling algorithms in a multipoint-to-point network such as the uplink
of an IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) network. Inadequate bandwidth allocation to a TCP
flow may lead to timeout and since TCP source drops its congestion window
($cwnd$) immediately after a timeout, it may affect the average throughput
adversely. On the other hand, since the TCP source increases its $cwnd$ only
linearly upon the availability of bandwidth, any excess assignment of bandwidth
may remain underutilized. The proposed scheduling algorithms address this by
allocating the resources based on $cwnd$ and TCP timeout. Moreover, since we
focus on uplink scheduling, we consider that only {\em flow} level resource
requirement is communicated to the Base Station ($BS$) instead of per {\em
packet} information. The schedulers also take into account the wireless channel
characteristics and are thus cross layer in nature. Through exhaustive
simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed schedulers exhibit enhanced
throughput and fairness properties when compared to that of Round Robin (RR)
scheduler under different shadowing. We demonstrate a gain between 3.5 \% to 15
\% in throughput and 15 \% to 25 \% in channel utilization over RR scheduler
under different shadowing.

  Channel",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random backpropagation (RBP) is a variant of the backpropagation algorithm
for training neural networks, where the transpose of the forward matrices are
replaced by fixed random matrices in the calculation of the weight updates. It
is remarkable both because of its effectiveness, in spite of using random
matrices to communicate error information, and because it completely removes
the taxing requirement of maintaining symmetric weights in a physical neural
system. To better understand random backpropagation, we first connect it to the
notions of local learning and learning channels. Through this connection, we
derive several alternatives to RBP, including skipped RBP (SRPB), adaptive RBP
(ARBP), sparse RBP, and their combinations (e.g. ASRBP) and analyze their
computational complexity. We then study their behavior through simulations
using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 bechnmark datasets. These simulations show that
most of these variants work robustly, almost as well as backpropagation, and
that multiplication by the derivatives of the activation functions is
important. As a follow-up, we study also the low-end of the number of bits
required to communicate error information over the learning channel. We then
provide partial intuitive explanations for some of the remarkable properties of
RBP and its variations. Finally, we prove several mathematical results,
including the convergence to fixed points of linear chains of arbitrary length,
the convergence to fixed points of linear autoencoders with decorrelated data,
the long-term existence of solutions for linear systems with a single hidden
layer and convergence in special cases, and the convergence to fixed points of
non-linear chains, when the derivative of the activation functions is included.

two-dimensional materials. Through first-principles investigation, we predict
two-dimensional materials of ReN$_{2}$: honeycomb and tetragonal structures.
The phonon spectra establish the dynamical stability for both of the two
structures, and the calculated in-plane stiffness constants proves their
mechanical stability. The energy bands near the Fermi level consist of N-p and
Re-d orbitals for the honeycomb structure, and are mainly from Re d orbitals
for the tetragonal structure. While the tetragonal structure is non-magnetic,
the honeycomb structure has N-based ferromagnetism, which will transit to
anti-ferromagnetism under 14$\%$ biaxial strain. The calculated electron
localization function and spin density indicate that direct N-N bond can occur
only in the honeycomb structure. The ferromagnetism allows us to distinguish
the two 2D phases easily. The tetragonal phase has lower energy than the
honeycomb one, which means that the tetragonal phase is more stable, but the
hexagonal phase has much larger bulk, shear, and Young's muduli than the
tetragonal phase. The tetragonal phase is a three-bands metal, and the
hexagonal phase is a ferromagnetic semi-metal. The special structural,
electronic, magnetic, and optical properties in the honeycomb and tetragonal
structures make them promising for novel applications.

correspondence estimation by proposing a statistical approach via maximum a

violating (LIV) higher-order derivative models, following the Myers-Pospelov
approach, to electrodynamics and massive gravitational waves. We compute the
corrected equation of motion of these models, their dispersion relations and
the velocities. The LIV parameters for the gravitational and electromagnetic
sectors, $\xi_{g}$ and $\xi_{\gamma}$, respectively, were also obtained for
three different approaches: luminal photons, time delay of flight and the
difference of graviton and photon velocities. These LIV parameters depend on
the mass scales where the LIV-terms become relevant, $M$ for the
electromagnetic sector and $M_{1}$ for the gravitational one. We obtain, using
the values for $M$ and $M_{1}$ found in the literature, that
$\xi_{g}\sim10^{-2}$, which is expected to be phenomenologically relevant and
$\xi_{\gamma}\sim10^{3}$, which cannot be suitable for an effective LIV theory.
However, we show that $\xi_{\gamma}$ can be interesting in a phenomenological
point of view if $M\gg M_{1}$. Finally the relation between the variation of
the velocities of the photon and the graviton in relation to the speed of light
was calculated and resulted in $\Delta v_{g}/\Delta

Jupiter XO-6b, which orbits a bright, hot, and fast rotating star: V = 10.25,
Teff = 6720 +/- 100 K, v sin i = 48 +/- 3 km/s. We detected the planet from its
transits using the XO instruments and conducted a follow-up campaign. Because
of the fast stellar rotation, radial velocities taken along the orbit do not
yield the planet's mass with a high confidence level, but we secure a 3-sigma
upper limit Mp < 4.4 MJup. We also obtain high resolution spectroscopic
observations of the transit with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 193-cm

profile by Doppler tomography. The transit is clearly detected in the spectra.
The radii measured independently from the tomographic analysis and from the

both methods is the same and indeed transits in front of XO-6. We find that
XO-6b lies on a prograde and misaligned orbit with a sky-projected obliquity
lambda = -20.7 +/- 2.3 deg. The rotation period of the star is shorter than the

into account by occupation numbers of local excited polaronic states and
variations in the magnitude of spin-spin correlation functions. Both effects

considered. The question is discussed how the energy dependence of the transfer
rate can be extracted from available experimental data. A model is suggested
which is based on two assumptions. First, the muon transfer occurs within an
interaction sphere out of which the entrance and transfer channels are not
coupled. Secondly, for the s- and p-waves at low collision energies, the
complex logarithmic derivatives of the radial wave functions of the entrance
channel on the interaction sphere are energy-independent. With only the s-wave
taken into account, two values of the logarithmic derivative were found, which
agree with the transfer rates measured at the temperatures of 20 and 300 K.
Within this temperature interval, the rates evaluated for these two values
differ only slightly. Noticeable differences arise at temperatures of a few
kelvins. The choice of the preferred value of the logarithmic derivative was
made by the comparison of the energy dependence of the S-matrix with results of
previous calculations. Thereby, the proposed procedure may be a way to correct
calculations at low collision energies.

aims at searching and characterizing transiting exoplanets from Dome C in
Antarctica and to qualify this site for photometry in the visible. Two
instruments were installed at Dome C and ran for six winters in total. The
analysis of the collected data is nearly complete. We present the operation of
the instruments, and the technical challenges, limitations, and possible
solutions in light of the data quality. The instruments performed continuous
observations during the winters. Human interventions are required mainly for
regular inspection and ice dust removal. A defrosting system is efficient at
preventing and removing ice on the mirrors. The PSF FWHM is 4.5 arcsec on
average which is 2.5 times larger than the specification, and is highly
variable; the causes are the poor ground-level seeing, the turbulent plumes
generated by the heating system, and to a lower extent the imperfect optical
alignment and focusing, and some astigmatism. We propose solutions for each of
these aspects that would largely increase the PSF stability. The astrometric
and guiding precisions are satisfactory and would deserve only minor
improvements. Major issues are encountered with the camera shutter which did
not close properly after two winters; we minimized this issue by heating the
shutter and by developing specific image calibration algorithms. Finally, we
summarize the site testing and science results obtained with ASTEP. Overall,
the ASTEP experiment will serve as a basis to design and operate future optical
and near-infrared telescopes in Antarctica.

sit on a critical boundary, beyond which there is qualitatively different

WIMP scenario. Inspite of numerous efforts to detect WIMP, till now we have no
direct evidence for it. A possible explanation for this non-observation of dark
matter could be because of its very feeble interaction strength and hence,
failing to thermalise with the rest of the cosmic soup. In other words, the
dark matter might be of non-thermal origin where the relic density is obtained
by the so-called freeze-in mechanism. Furthermore, if this non-thermal dark
matter is itself produced substantially from the decay of another non-thermal
mother particle, then their distribution functions may differ in both size and
shape from the usual equilibrium distribution function. In this work, we have
studied such a non-thermal (fermionic) dark matter scenario in the light of a
new type of $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ model. The $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ model is interesting,
since, besides being anomaly free, it can give rise to neutrino mass by Type II
see-saw mechanism. Moreover, as we will show, it can accommodate a non-thermal
fermionic dark matter as well. Starting from the collision terms, we have
calculated the momentum distribution function for the dark matter by solving a
coupled system of Boltzmann equations. We then used it to calculate the final
relic abundance, as well as other relevant physical quantities. We have also
compared our result with that obtained from solving the usual Boltzmann (or
rate) equations directly in terms of comoving number density, $Y$. Our findings
suggest that the latter approximation is valid only in cases where the system
under study is close to equilibrium, and hence should be used with caution.

the possibility of changing variability. The resulting tests are robust both to

safety at road intersections and overrides drivers with a safe input when
necessary. The design of the supervisor consists of two parts: safety
verification and control design. Safety verification is the problem to
determine if vehicles will be able to cross the intersection without colliding
with current drivers' inputs. We translate this safety verification problem
into a jobshop scheduling problem, which minimizes the maximum lateness and
evaluates if the optimal cost is zero. The zero optimal cost corresponds to the
case in which all vehicles can cross each conflict area without collisions.
Computing the optimal cost requires solving a Mixed Integer Nonlinear
Programming (MINLP) problem due to the nonlinear second-order dynamics of the
vehicles. We therefore estimate this optimal cost by formulating two related
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that assume simpler vehicle
dynamics. We prove that these two MILP problems yield lower and upper bounds of
the optimal cost. We also quantify the worst case approximation errors of these
MILP problems. We design the supervisor to override the vehicles with a safe
control input if the MILP problem that computes the upper bound yields a
positive optimal cost. We theoretically demonstrate that the supervisor keeps
the intersection safe and is non-blocking. Computer simulations further
validate that the algorithms can run in real time for problems of realistic
size.

gauge-invariance in just (n-1) particles together with minimal power-counting
uniquely fixes the amplitude. Unitarity in the form of factorization then
follows from locality and gauge invariance. We also give evidence for a
stronger conjecture: assuming only that singularities occur when the sum of a
subset of external momenta go on-shell, we show in non-trivial examples that
gauge-invariance and power-counting demand a graph structure for singularities.
Thus both locality and unitarity emerge from singularities and gauge
invariance. Similar statements hold for theories of Goldstone bosons like the
non-linear sigma model and Dirac-Born-Infeld, by replacing the condition of
gauge invariance with an appropriate degree of vanishing in soft limits.

Applying the equation of state in the Skyrme framework for the neutron matter
(NM), we calculate the mass-radius relation for different DMANSs with various
DMEOSs and central pressure of dark matter (DM) to NM ratios. Our results show
that for some DMEOSs, the mass-radius relations are in agreement with new
observations, e.g. EXO 1745-248, 4U 1608-52, and 4U 1820-30, which are
inconsistent with the normal neutron stars. We conclude that both DMEOSs and
central pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius
relation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which
leads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM
sphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results
confirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a
halo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the
different degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible
radius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can be exist. The
gravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and
central pressure ratios. The results explain that the existence of DM in a
DMANS leads to higher values of gravitational redshift of the star.

temperature, indicative of alkali rainout. We also find little evidence for
optically thick clouds. With the methane and water abundances, we derive the
intrinsic atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratios. We find in our

are somewhat super solar, different than expectations from the local stellar
population. We also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are
consistent with radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions. Finally,
we find that our retrieved effective temperatures are lower than previous

rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding
approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into
lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in
recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose
embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of
these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the
heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two
folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author
identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to
the heterogeneity of the network.
  To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented
heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded
as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly
trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend
the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in
heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The
guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both
explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our
experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with
task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at
identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.

available IFS. For both samples, $\sigma_{\star}$ is determined via two
different methods that are popular in the literature, and we provide fits for
each sample based on both sets of $\sigma_{\star}$. We find the fit to the AGN
sample is shallower than the fit to the quiescent galaxy sample, and that the
slopes for each sample are in agreement with previous investigations. However,
the intercepts to the quiescent galaxy relations are notably higher than those
found in previous studies, due to the systematically lower $\sigma_{\star}$
measurements that we obtain from IFS. We find that this may be driven, in part,
by poorly constrained measurements of bulge effective radius ($r_{e}$) for the
quiescent galaxy sample, which may bias the $\sigma_{\star}$ measurements low.
We use these quiescent galaxy parameterizations, as well as one from the
literature, to recalculate the virial scaling factor $f$. We assess the
potential biases in each measurement, and suggest $f=4.82\pm1.67$ as the best
currently available estimate. However, we caution that the details of how
$\sigma_{\star}$ is measured can significantly affect $f$, and there is still
much room for improvement.

that variations in R(V) are correlated on kiloparsec scales. In particular,
most of the dust within one kiloparsec in the outer Galaxy, including many
local molecular clouds (Orion, Taurus, Perseus, California, Cepheus), has a
significantly lower R(V) than more distant dust in the Milky Way. These results
provide new input to models of dust evolution and processing, and complicate
application of locally derived extinction curves to more distant regions of the

scalar field to extract rotational energy from a spinning Kerr black hole.
Interestingly, the energy extraction rate can grow exponentially in time if the
black-hole-field system is placed inside a reflecting mirror which prevents the
field from radiating its energy to infinity. This composed
Kerr-black-hole-scalar-field-mirror system, first designed by Press and
Teukolsky, has attracted the attention of physicists over the last four
decades. Previous numerical studies of this spinning {\it black-hole bomb} have
revealed the interesting fact that the superradiant instability shuts down if
the reflecting mirror is placed too close to the black-hole horizon. In the
present study we use analytical techniques to explore the superradiant
instability regime of this composed
Kerr-black-hole-linearized-scalar-field-mirror system. In particular, it is
proved that the lower bound ${{r_{\text{m}}}\over{r_+}}>{1\over
2}\Big(\sqrt{1+{{8M}\over{r_-}}}-1\Big)$ provides a necessary condition for the
development of the exponentially growing superradiant instabilities in this
composed physical system, where $r_{\text{m}}$ is the radius of the confining
mirror and $r_{\pm}$ are the horizon radii of the spinning Kerr black hole. We
further show that, in the linearized regime, this {\it analytically} derived
lower bound on the radius of the confining mirror agrees with direct {\it
numerical} computations of the superradiant instability spectrum which
characterizes the spinning black-hole-mirror bomb.

redshift uncertainty.
  We calculate the correlation function for cluster sub-samples covering
various mass and redshift bins selected from a light-cone catalogue. To
simulate the distribution of clusters in photometric redshift space, we assign
to each cluster a redshift randomly extracted from a Gaussian distribution. The
dispersion is varied in the range $\sigma_{(z=0)} = 0.001$ to $0.050$. The
correlation function in real-space is computed through estimation and
deprojection of $w_{p}(r_{p})$. Four mass ranges (from $M_{halo}> 2 \times
10^{13}$ to $M_{halo}> 2 \times 10^{14}$) and six redshift slices covering the
redshift range [0,2] are investigated, using cosmological redshifts and photo-z
configurations.
  We find a clear increase of the correlation amplitude as a function of
redshift and mass for the $z_{c}$ samples. The evolution of the derived bias
parameter is in agreement with theoretical expectations. From our pilot sample
limited to $M_{halo}> 5 \times 10^{13} (0.4 < z < 0.7)$, we find that the

more massive galaxies. Interestingly, we also discovered that more than 10\% of

candidate members of nearby young moving groups (YMG) with spectral types
L7-T4.5, including three showing spectroscopic signs of low gravity. If

help to determine the effective temperature at which young brown dwarfs cross

formulae allow to compute the Sommerfeld effect, not only for the lowest term

the spin of the annihilating particle on the symmetry of the two-particle wave

we generalize our results to particles charged under an arbitrary unbroken

the typical eccentricity they acquire while interacting with the dense

upper limits can only place an upper bound on the overall MBHB merger rate.
Depending on the properties of the array, future detections can also constrain
several MBHB population models at different degrees of fidelity. In particular,
a simultaneous detection of a steepening of the spectrum at high frequency and
a bending at low frequency will place strong constraints on both the MBHB mass
function and on the typical eccentricity of inspiralling MBHBs, providing
insights on MBHB astrophysics unlikely to be achievable by any other means.

towards 100 quasars with emission redshifts between $z=3.55$ and $z=7.08$.
Using infrared spectra from Magellan/FIRE, we detect 279 cosmological MgII
absorbers, and confirm that the incidence rate of $W_r>0.3 \AA$ MgII absorption
per comoving path length does not evolve measurably between $z=0.25$ and $z=7$.
This is consistent with our detection of seven new MgII systems at $z>6$, a
redshift range that was not covered in prior searches. Restricting to
relatively strong MgII systems ($W_r>1$\AA), there is significant evidence for
redshift evolution. These systems roughly double in number density between
$z=0$ and $z=2$-$3$, but decline by an order of magnitude from this peak by
$z\sim 6$. This evolution mirrors that of the global star formation rate
density, which could reflect a connection between star formation feedback and
strong MgII absorbers. We compared our results to the Illustris cosmological
simulation at $z=2$-$4$ by assigning absorption to catalogued dark-matter halos
and by direct extraction of spectra from the simulation volume. To reproduce
our results using the halo catalogs, we require circumgalactic (CGM) MgII
envelopes within halos of progressively smaller mass at earlier times. This
occurs naturally if we define the lower integration cutoff using SFR rather
than mass. MgII profiles calculated directly from the Illustris volume yield
far too few strong absorbers. We argue that this arises from unresolved phase
space structure of CGM gas, particularly from turbulent velocities on sub-mesh
scales. The presence of CGM MgII at $z>6$-- just $\sim 250$ Myr after the
reionization redshift implied by Planck--suggests that enrichment of intra-halo
gas may have begun before the presumed host galaxies' stellar populations were
mature and dynamically relaxed. [abridged]

efficiently simulated and threshold values for Pauli error rates under a

quantum systems can undergo noise processes that differ significantly from
Pauli noise. In this paper, we present an efficient hard decoding algorithm for
optimizing thresholds and lowering failure rates of an error-correcting code
under general completely positive and trace-preserving (i.e., Markovian) noise.
We use our hard decoding algorithm to study the performance of several
error-correcting codes under various non-Pauli noise models by computing
threshold values and failure rates for these codes. We compare the performance
of our hard decoding algorithm to decoders optimized for depolarizing noise and
show improvements in thresholds and reductions in failure rates by several
orders of magnitude. Our hard decoding algorithm can also be adapted to take
advantage of a code's non-Pauli transversal gates to further suppress noise.
For example, we show that using the transversal gates of the 5-qubit code
allows arbitrary rotations around certain axes to be perfectly corrected.
Furthermore, we show that Pauli twirling can increase or decrease the threshold
depending upon the code properties. Lastly, we show that even if the physical
noise model differs slightly from the hypothesized noise model used to
determine an optimized decoder, failure rates can still be reduced by applying
our hard decoding algorithm.

development. We consider metal-poor and old stars in both Galactic halo and
bulge and make use of stellar orbits, gas density and metallicity distributions
in Eris. Assuming spherically symmetric Bondi-Hoyle accretion, we find that
halo and bulge stars accrete metals at the rate of about 10^-24 solar mass per
year and 10^-22 solar mass per year, respectively, at redshifts z < 3, but this
accretion rate increases hundred-fold to about 10^-20 solar mass per year at
higher redshifts due to increased gas density. Bulge and halo stars accrete
similar amounts of metals at high redshifts as kinematically distinct bulge and
halo are not yet developed at these redshifts and both sets of stars encounter
similar metal distribution in the ISM on average. Accretion alone can enrich
main-sequence stars up to [Fe/H] -2 in extreme cases.Median enrichment level
due to accretion in these stars is about [Fe/H]~-6 to -5.Because accretion
mostly takes place at high redshifts, it is alpha-enriched to [alpha/Fe]~0.5.
We find that accretive metal enrichment is significant enough to affect the
predicted metallicity distribution function of halo stars at [Fe/H] < -5.This
suggests that attempts to infer the natal chemical environment of the most
metal-poor stars from their observed enrichment today can be hindered due to
metal accretion. Peculiar enrichment patterns such as those predicted to arise
from pair-instability supernovae could help in disentangling natal and accreted

of assembly bias -- relying on the near-Lognormal distribution of halo

observationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic

breaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum
could be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent
1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular
boosted dark matter ($\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\chi$
is assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a
massive scalar ($\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's
dark matter. We show that this hypothesis, coupled with a standard power-law
astrophysical neutrino flux is capable of providing very good fits to the
present data, along with a possible explanation of other features in the HESE
sample. These features include a) the paucity of events beyond $\sim 2$ PeV b)
a spectral feature resembling a dip or a spectral change in the 400 TeV--1 PeV
region and c) an excess in the $50-100$ TeV region. We consider two different
boosted DM scenarios, and determine the allowed mass ranges and couplings for
four different types of mediators (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and
axial-vector) which could connect the standard and dark sectors. We consider
constraints from gamma-ray observations and collider searches. We find that the
gamma-ray observations provide the most restrictive constraints, disfavouring
the $1\sigma$ allowed parameter space from IC fits, while still being
consistent with the $3\sigma$ allowed region. We also test our proposal and its
implications against IC's recent six-year through-going muon track data.

meandering wire NbN detectors by altering the field distribution across the
wire. In order to calculate the response of the detectors with different
geometries, we use a monotonic local detection efficiency from a nanowire and
optical absorption distribution via finite-different-time-domain simulations.
The calculations predict a trade-off between average absorption and the edge
effect leading to a predicted optimal wire width close to 100 nm for 1550 nm
wavelength, which drops to 50 nm wire width for 600 nm wavelength. The
absorption at the edges can be enhanced by depositing a silicon nanowire on top
of the superconducting nanowire, which improves both the total absorption
efficiency as well as the internal detection efficiency of meandering wire
structures.

makes the learned convolutional features easier to transfer. Additionally,
joint training using multiple datasets of varied sizes and class labels is
supported resulting in increased recognition performance. The experimental

strongly on the band dispersion. When probed simultaneously with $d$-wave

way to image protoplanetary disks. However, interpretation of these images is
difficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle
of scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with
and without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a
function of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are
distorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more
eccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations
are unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks
with gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less
polarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased
contrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks,
gaps can take on the appearance of being localized ""holes"" in brightness rather
than full axisymmetric structures. Photocenter offsets along the minor axis of
the disk in both total intensity and polarized intensity images can be readily
explained by the finite thickness of the disk. Alone, polarized scattered light
images of disks do not necessarily reveal intrinsic disk structure. However,
when combined with total intensity images, the orientation of the disk can be
deduced and much can be learned about disk structure and dust properties.

similar role in extraterrestrial biospheres. The major reservoir of nitrogen at

size of this reservoir may have fluctuated significantly over the course of
Earth's history with particularly low levels in the Neoarchean - presumably as
a result of biological activity. We used a biogeochemical box model to test
which conditions are necessary to cause large swings in atmospheric N2
pressure. Parameters for our model are constrained by observations of modern
Earth and reconstructions of biomass burial and oxidative weathering in deep
time. A 1-D climate model was used to model potential effects on atmospheric
climate. In a second set of tests, we perturbed our box model to investigate
which parameters have the greatest impact on the evolution of atmospheric pN2
and consider possible implications for nitrogen cycling on other planets. Our
results suggest that (a) a high rate of biomass burial would have been needed
in the Archean to draw down atmospheric pN2 to less than half modern levels,
(b) the resulting effect on temperature could probably have been compensated by
increasing solar luminosity and a mild increase in pCO2, and (c) atmospheric
oxygenation could have initiated a stepwise pN2 rebound through oxidative
weathering. In general, life appears to be necessary for significant
atmospheric pN2 swings on Earth-like planets. Our results further support the
idea that an exoplanetary atmosphere rich in both N2 and O2 is a signature of
an oxygen-producing biosphere.

simulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated
magnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model
VIP4 and up-to-date interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as
benchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like magnetic fields can be found for
a number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal gas or
use the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no
difference. However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads
to strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost
when the convective driving is too strong. The required intermediate range that
yields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties. The
second factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a
product of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We
find that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a good proxy for the top of
the dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole is
once more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to
Jupiter and the result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the
planetary radius.
  The zonal flows in our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely
confined to the molecular layer. Where the jet reaches down to higher
electrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega dynamo
that modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet. This
secondary dynamo can lead to strong magnetic field patches at low latitudes
that seem compatible with the VIP4 model.

estimates to produce a global estimate of the covariance matrix. Existing
divide and conquer methods focus exclusively on dividing the total number of

subproblem. The subproblems themselves can be challenging to solve when $p$ is
large due to the dependencies across dimensions. To circumvent this issue, we
specify a novel hierarchical structure on the latent factors that allows for
flexible dependencies across dimensions, while still maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach is readily parallelizable and is shown to have
computational efficiency of several orders of magnitude in comparison to
fitting a full factor model. We report the performance of our method in

However, applying original FSI in digital micro-mirror device (DMD) based

log-normal distribution with a central mass of $0.21^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$
$M_{\odot}$ and a characteristic width of $0.8^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ dex in the 12
$M_{\rm Jup}$-2 $M_{\odot}$ range, whereas a Salpeter power law with $\alpha =
2.2^{+1.1}_{-0.5}$ best describes the IMF slope in the $0.1-2$ $M_{\odot}$
range. This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which
may be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A
tentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS
J11472421-2040204 and 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates
that there might be as many as $10^{+13}_{-5}$ similar members of TWA with
hot-start model-dependent masses estimated at $\sim$ 5-7 $M_{\rm Jup}$, most of
which would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS. Our new radial velocity
measurements corroborate the membership of 2MASS J11472421-2040204, and secure
TWA 28 (M8.5$\gamma$), TWA 29 (M9.5$\gamma$) and TWA 33 (M4.5e) as members. The
discovery of 2MASS J09553336-0208403, a young L7-type interloper unrelated to
TWA, is also presented.

heavily stripped massive stars which lost their envelopes via binary
interactions with a compact companion star. They eject only ~ 0.1 Msun and may
be the main way to form double neutron-star systems which eventually merge
emitting strong gravitational waves. We follow the evolution of an
ultra-stripped supernova progenitor until iron core collapse and perform
explosive nucleosynthesis calculations. We then synthesize light curves and
spectra of ultra-stripped supernovae using the nucleosynthesis results and
present their expected properties. Ultra-stripped supernovae synthesize ~ 0.01
Msun of radioactive 56Ni, and their typical peak luminosity is around 1e42
erg/s or -16 mag. Their typical rise time is 5 - 10 days. Comparing synthesized
and observed spectra, we find that SN 2005ek, some of the so-called
calcium-rich gap transients, and SN 2010X may be related to ultra-stripped
supernovae. If these supernovae are actually ultra-stripped supernovae, their
event rate is expected to be about 1 per cent of core-collapse supernovae.
Comparing the double neutron-star merger rate obtained by future
gravitational-wave observations and the ultra-stripped supernova rate obtained
by optical transient surveys identified with our synthesized light-curve and
spectral models, we will be able to judge whether ultra-stripped supernovae are
actually a major contributor to the binary neutron star population and provide
constraints on binary stellar evolution.

understanding with wearable first-person point-of-view cameras. Traditional
hand segmentation approaches rely on a large corpus of manually labeled data to
generate robust hand detectors. However, these approaches still face challenges
as the appearance of the hand varies greatly across users, tasks, environments
or illumination conditions. A key observation in the case of many wearable
applications and interfaces is that, it is only necessary to accurately detect
the user's hands in a specific situational context. Based on this observation,
we introduce an interactive approach to learn a person-specific hand
segmentation model that does not require any manually labeled training data.
Our approach proceeds in two steps, an interactive bootstrapping step for
identifying moving hand regions, followed by learning a personalized user
specific hand appearance model. Concretely, our approach uses two convolutional
neural networks: (1) a gesture network that uses pre-defined motion information
to detect the hand region; and (2) an appearance network that learns a person
specific model of the hand region based on the output of the gesture network.
During training, to make the appearance network robust to errors in the gesture
network, the loss function of the former network incorporates the confidence of
the gesture network while learning. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of
our approach with an F1 score over 0.8 on all challenging datasets across a
wide range of illumination and hand appearance variations, improving over a
baseline approach by over 10%.

Tribopolymer buildup can prevent MEMS and NEMS from making or breaking
electrical contact. We describe the adsorption of benzene (C6H6) on the
RuO2(110) surface using density functional theory. This adsorption is an
important initial step in the mechanism of hydrocarbon tribopolymer layer
formation on MEMS and NEMS devices. The adsorption interaction is studied by
considering three oxygen coverages of RuO2(110) and all the possible adsorption
sites for benzene. We find that adsorption of benzene on O-poor RuO2(110) via
C-Ru bonds is stronger than adsorption on the O-rich RuO2(110) via H-O bonds.
For an in-depth study of the adsorption behavior, we include the van der Waals
interaction for a holistic investigation. By incorporating the thermodynamic
chemical potentials into the adsorption simulations, we describe a model that
can provide guidance for realistic situations.

only two parameters in each quark type and subsequently lead to a CKM matrix
which depends on at most four parameters. The fitting of theoretically derived
CKM elements and their corresponding empirical values are as good as ${\bf

fine-tuning parameters into the CKM matrix suitably, the fitting is further
improved to ${\bf O}(10^{-4})$. After the derivation, we find this hypothesis
also applies to the Standard Model and even a model with three Higgs doublets.
This will be a big progress in the derivation of a theoretical origin of CP

services---whether for management, security, diagnostics, optimization, or
simply enhancing our collective understanding of the Internet as a complex
system. Further, measurements are useful across points of view---from end hosts
to enterprise networks and data centers to the wide area Internet. We observe
that many measurements are decoupled from the protocols and applications they
are designed to illuminate. Worse, current measurement practice often involves
the exploitation of side-effects and unintended features of the network, or, in
other words, the artful piling of hacks atop one another. This state of affairs
is a direct result of the relative paucity of diagnostic and measurement
capabilities built into today's network stack.
  Given our modern dependence on ubiquitous measurement, we propose
measurability as an explicit low-level goal of current protocol design, and
argue that measurements should be available to all network protocols throughout
the stack. We seek to generalize the idea of measurement within protocols,
e.g., the way in which TCP relies on measurement to drive its end-to-end
behavior. Rhetorically, we pose the question: what if the stack had been built
with measurability and diagnostic support in mind? We start from a set of
principles for explicit measurability, and define primitives that, were they
supported by the stack, would not only provide a solid foundation for protocol
design going forward, but also reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of
measuring the network.

complexes can be defined for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. However,
Delaunay's genericity assumption no longer guarantees that the Delaunay complex
will yield a triangulation; stronger assumptions on $P$ are required. A natural
one is to assume that $P$ is sufficiently dense. Although results in this
direction have been claimed, we show that sample density alone is insufficient
to ensure that the Delaunay complex triangulates a manifold of dimension
greater than 2.

the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs.
We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on
finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is
illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are
obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the
third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network
simulation. We further incorporate these approaches with equation free

  Properties",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study social choice rules under the utilitarian distortion framework, with
an additional metric assumption on the agents' costs over the alternatives. In
this approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all
agents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal
preferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them.
Distortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the
sum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and
that of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The
worst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how
close it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the
underlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs,
the well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3
[Anshelevich et al. 2015]. We disprove this conjecture by constructing a
sequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked
Pairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst case distortion of Ranked
Pairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving
that in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked
Pairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament
rules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected
worst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate
majorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and
Randomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3
respectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for
the sum of costs and single largest cost objectives. In addition to all of the
above, we outline several interesting directions for further research in this

that the mechanism answers the workload with error at most $\alpha$ on any

[STOC 2010], we analyze sample complexity using the tools of asymptotic convex

neighboring databases. This is the information that, roughly speaking, is
protected by a differentially private algorithm, and, for this reason, we
expect that a ""bigger"" sensitivity polytope implies larger sample complexity.
Our results identify the mean Gaussian width as an appropriate measure of the

quantity. Our lower bounds completely characterize the workloads for which the
Gaussian noise mechanism is optimal up to constants as those having

associated with supernovae (LONG-SNe) - 19 events - presents a very high
correlation coefficient between the luminosity at the end of the plateau phase
La and the end time of the plateau T*a, hereafter Dainotti relation.
Furthermore, these SNe Ib/c associated with GRBs also obey the peak-magnitude
stretch relation, similar to that used to standardize the SNe Ia. We here
investigate a category of GRBs with plateau and associated with SNe to compare
the Dainotti correlation for this sample with the correlation for long GRBs for
which no associated SN has been observed (hereafter LONG-NO-SNe, 128 GRBs) and
to check whether there is a difference among these sub-samples. We first
adopted a non-parametric statistical method to take redshift evolution into
account and to check if and how this effect may steepen the slope for the
LONG-NO-SNe sample. Therefore, removing selection bias is the first step before
any comparison among samples observed at different redshifts could be properly
performed. Then, we applied the T-student test to evaluate a statistical
difference between the slopes of the two samples. We demonstrate that there is
no evolution for the slope of the LONG-NO-SNe sample and no evolution is
expected for the LONG-SNe sample at small redshifts. The difference between the
slope of the LONG-NO-SNe and the slope of LONG-SNe with firm spectral detection
of SN components, is statistically significant. This possibly suggests that,
unlike LONG-NO-SNe, LONG-SNe with firm spectroscopic features of the associated
SNe might not require a standard energy reservoir in the plateau phase.
Therefore, this analysis may open new perspectives in future theoretical
investigations of the GRBs with plateau emission and that are associated with
SNe.

may have important consequences on the size of the nuclear matrix elements.
From an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the life times are
extremely long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. One needs
large isotopically enriched sources and detectors with good energy resolution
and very low background.

correlation matrices from lower dimensional channel measurements is presented.
Exploiting the symmetry of correlation matrix structure enables reproducing
higher dimensional MIMO channel matrices from available lower order
measurements. This leads to practically important applications allowing
prediction of higher dimensional MIMO system capacity. In particular, we study
Kronecker-type MIMO channels suitable for reconstructing full channel matrices
from partial information about transmit-receive fading in spatial and
polarimetric domains and analyze validity conditions for such models. One of
the important channel conditions is Doppler frequency related to
non-stationarity in the environment. We present simulations of cluster-type
scattering model using 2x2 MIMO channel correlation matrices to predict
performance of 2x4 MIMO system including recovery of angular power spectrum. An
example of dual circular polarized 2x4 MIMO land mobile satellite measurements
in 2.5 GHz frequency band illustrates applicability of the method to
reconstruct spatial and polarimetric channel correlation matrices for
estimating ergodic channel capacity from single-antenna or uni-polarized
measurements.

discovers the available idle D2D neighbors for such poor channel users and
offloads its data to the D2D neighbor, which then relays the data to the eNB.
We have developed a D2D offloading simulation model in MATLAB, have conducted

network connectivity is extremely poor in several agricultural regions which
makes the end-to-end connectivity between the farmers and the expert system
intermittent. Therefore, providing agro-advisory services to farmers in a

turbulent Rayleigh-Benard flows in closed cylindrical cells of unit aspect
ratio is revisited from a transitional and turbulent viscous boundary layer
perspective. When the Rayleigh number is large enough, the dynamics at the
bottom and top plates can be separated into an impact region of downwelling
plumes, an ejection region of upwelling plumes and an interior region away from
the side walls. The latter is dominated by the shear of the large-scale
circulation (LSC) roll which fills the whole cell and continuously varies its
orientation. The working fluid is liquid mercury or gallium at a Prandtl number
Pr=0.021 for Rayleigh numbers between Ra=3e+5 and 4e+8. The generated turbulent
momentum transfer corresponds to macroscopic flow Reynolds numbers with values
between 1800 and 46000. It is shown that the viscous boundary layers for the
largest Rayleigh numbers are highly transitional and obey properties that are
directly comparable to transitional channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers
Re_tau slightly below 100. The transitional character of the viscous boundary
layer is also underlined by the strong enhancement of the fluctuations of the
wall stress components with increasing Rayleigh number. An extrapolation of our
analysis data suggests that the friction Reynolds number Re_tau in the velocity
boundary layer can reach values of 200 for Ra beyond 1e+11. Thus the viscous
boundary layer in a liquid metal flow would become turbulent at a much lower
Rayleigh number than for turbulent convection in gases and gas mixtures.

continuous but not differentiable on switching manifolds (where the functional
form of the map changes). The stability of fixed points on switching manifolds
is investigated in scenarios for which one-sided derivatives are locally
bounded. The lack of differentiability allows fixed points to be Milnor
attractors despite being unstable. For this reason a measure-theoretic notion
of stability is considered in addition to standard notions of stability.
Locally the map is well approximated by a piecewise-linear map that is linearly
homogeneous when the fixed point is at the origin. For the class of continuous,
linearly homogeneous maps, and $o({\bf x})$ perturbations of these maps, a
sufficient condition for the exponential stability of the origin is obtained.
It is shown how the stability of the origin can be determined by analysing
invariant probability measures of a map on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. The results are
illustrated for the two-dimensional border-collision normal form. The fixed
point may be asymptotically stable even if both smooth components of the map
are area-expanding, and unstable even if it is the $\omega$-limit set of almost
all points in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

  spin-extended coupled electron pair approximation","15 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a size-consistent generalization of the recently developed
spin-extended configuration interaction with singles and doubles (ECISD), where
a CI wave function is explicitly spin-projected. The size-consistent effect is
effectively incorporated by treating quadruples within the formulation of
coupled electron pair approximation. As in coupled-cluster theory, quadruple
excitations are approximated by a disconnected product of double excitations.
Despite its conceptual similarity to the standard single- and multireference
analogues, such a generalization requires careful derivation, as the
spin-projected CI space is non-orthogonal and overcomplete. Although our
methods generally yield better results than ECISD, size-consistency is only
approximately retained because the action of a symmetry-projection operator is
size-inconsistent. In this work, we focus on simple models where
exclusion-principle-violating terms, which eliminate undesired contributions to
the correlation effects, are either completely neglected or averaged. These
models possess an orbital-invariant energy functional that is to be minimized
by diagonalizing an energy-shifted effective Hamiltonian within the singles and
doubles manifold. This allows for a straightforward generalization of the ECISD
analytical gradients needed to determine molecular properties and geometric
optimization. Given the multireference nature of the spin-projected
Hartree--Fock method, the proposed approaches are expected to handle static
correlation, unlike single-reference analogues. We critically assess the
performance of our methods using dissociation curves of molecules,
singlet-triplet splitting gaps, hyperfine coupling constants, and the chromium
dimer. The size-consistency and size-extensivity of the methods are also
discussed.

A family of non-diagonal boundary interactions that are compatible with the

cohomology of the corresponding supercharges is explicitly computed as a
function of the parameters and the length of the chain. For certain specific

continuously increasing traffic demand in modern wireless systems. Even though
mmWave bands are scarcely occupied, the design of a prospect transceiver should
guarantee the efficient coexistence with the incumbent services in these bands.
To that end, in this paper, two underlay cognitive transceiver designs are
proposed that enable the mmWave spectrum access while controlling the
interference to the incumbent users. MmWave systems usually require large
antenna arrays to achieve satisfactory performance and thus, they cannot
support fully digital transceiver designs due to high demands in hardware
complexity and power consumption. Thus, in order to develop efficient
solutions, the proposed approaches are based on a hybrid analog-digital
pre-coding architecture. In such hybrid designs, the overall beamformer can be
factorized in a low dimensional digital counterpart applied in the baseband and
in an analog one applied in the RF domain. The first cognitive solution
developed in this paper designs the cognitive hybrid pre-coder by maximizing
the mutual information between its two ends subject to interference, power and
hardware constraints related to the analog counterpart. The second solution

by minimizing the Frobenious norm of its difference to the optimal digital only
one. A novel solution for the post-coder at the cognitive receiver part is
further proposed here based on a hardware constrained Minimum Mean Square Error
criterion. Simulations show that the performance of both the proposed hybrid

  Using a New Method for Multi-Frequency Calibration","Accepted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/177",,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe a new approach for mm-VLBI calibration that
provides bona-fide astrometric alignment of the mm-wavelength images from a
single source, for the measurement of frequency dependent effects, such as
`core-shifts' near the black hole of AGN jets. We achieve our astrometric
alignment by solving firstly for the ionospheric (dispersive) contributions
using wide-band cm-wavelength observations. Secondly we solve for the
tropospheric (non-dispersive) contributions by using fast frequency-switching
at the target mm-wavelengths. These solutions can be scaled and transferred
from the low frequency to the high frequency. To complete the calibration chain
one additional step was required to remove a residual constant phase offset on
each antenna. The result is an astrometric calibration and the measurement of
the core-shift between 22 and 43 GHz for the jet in BL Lacertae to be -8$\pm$5,
20$\pm$6 $\mu$as, in RA and Declination, respectively. By comparison to
conventional phase referencing at cm-wavelengths we are able to show that this
core shift at mm-wavelengths is significantly less than what would be predicted
by extrapolating the low frequency result, which closely followed the
predictions of the Blandford \& K\""onigl conical jet model. As such it would be
the first demonstration for the association of the VLBI core with a
recollimation shock, normally hidden at low frequencies due to the optical
depth, which could be responsible for the $\gamma$-ray production in blazar
jets.

  Nov 2016",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work is a conceptual analysis of certain recent developments in the
mathematical foundations of Classical and Quantum Mechanics which have allowed
to formulate both theories in a common language. From the algebraic point of
view, the set of observables of a physical system, be it classical or quantum,
is described by a \emph{Jordan-Lie algebra}. From the geometric point of view,
the space of states of any system is described by a \emph{uniform Poisson space
with transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as
formal translations of \emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in
Mechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The
question becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two
roles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as
distinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition
between properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations.
  Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a
certain ""abstract way"" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the
practice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify
particular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how,
within the formalism, one can construct a \emph{labelling scheme}. The ""Chase
for Individuation"" is the analysis of different mathematical techniques which
attempt to overcome this tension. In particular, we discuss how group theory
furnishes a partial solution.

have been extensively studied in the recent past. Unfortunately, due to the
lack of mature fabrication support, QCA-based circuits often suffer from
various types of manufacturing defects and variations, and therefore, are
unreliable and error-prone. QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently
used in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear
feedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the
existing designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring
fault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly
tolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing
fault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), NAND
multiplexing, and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization
of QCA XOR gate. Our investigations reveal that these techniques incur
prohibitively large area and delay and hence, they are unsuitable for practical
scenarios. We propose here realistic designs of QCA XOR gates (in terms of area
and delay) with significantly high fault-tolerance against all types of cell
misplacement defects such as cell omission, cell displacement, cell
misalignment and extra/additional cell deposition. Furthermore, the absence of
any crossing in the proposed designs facilitates low-cost fabrication of such
systems.

the nature of fluorescence, with discrete molecular entities emitting a stream

become by growing deterministic aggregates from single conjugated polymer
chains. Even particles containing dozens of individual chains still behave as
single quantum emitters due to efficient excitation energy transfer, while the
brightness is raised due to the increased absorption cross-section of the
suprastructure. Excitation energy can delocalize between individual polymer
chromophores in these aggregates by both coherent and incoherent coupling,
which are differentiated by their distinct spectroscopic fingerprints. Coherent
coupling is identified by a ten-fold increase in excited-state lifetime and a
corresponding spectral red shift. Exciton quenching due to incoherent FRET
becomes more significant as aggregate size increases, resulting in
single-aggregate emission characterized by strong blinking. This mesoscale
approach allows us to identify intermolecular interactions which do not exist
in isolated chains and are inaccessible in bulk films where they are present

space is a repository, where processes can add, withdraw or read tuples by
means of atomic operations. Tuples may contain different values, and processes
can inspect their content via pattern matching. The lack of a reference
implementation for this paradigm has prevented its widespread. In this paper,
first we perform an extensive analysis of a number of actual implementations of
the tuple space paradigm and summarise their main features. Then, we select
four such implementations and compare their performances on four different case
studies that aim at stressing different aspects of computing such as
communication, data manipulation, and cpu usage. After reasoning on strengths

polymer chains is one of the central observations made by single-molecule
spectroscopy (SMS). Important information, e.g., regarding excitation energy
transfer, can be extracted by evaluating dynamic quenching. However, the nature
of trap states, which are responsible for PL quenching, often remains obscured.
We present a detailed investigation of the photon statistics of single
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) chains obtained by SMS. The photon statistics
provide a measure of the number and brightness of independently emitting areas
on a single chain. These observables can be followed during blinking. A
decrease in PL intensity is shown to be correlated with either (i) a decrease
in the average brightness of the emitting sites; or (ii) a decrease in the
number of emitting regions. We attribute these phenomena to the formation of
(i) shallow charge traps, which can weakly affect all emitting areas of a
single chain at once; and (ii) deep traps, which have a strong effect on small
regions within the single chains.

central role in mesoscopic quantum transport. The recursive GF technique is a
standard tool to compute this quantity numerically, but it lacks physical
transparency and is limited to relatively small systems. Here we present a
numerically efficient and physically transparent GF formalism for a general
layered structure. In contrast to the recursive GF that directly calculates the
GF through the Dyson equations, our approach converts the calculation of the GF
to the generation and subsequent propagation of a scattering wave function
emanating from a local excitation. This viewpoint not only allows us to
reproduce existing results in a concise and physically intuitive manner, but
also provides analytical expressions of the GF in terms of a generalized
scattering matrix. This identifies the contributions from each individual
scattering channel to the GF and hence allows this information to be extracted
quantitatively from dual-probe STM experiments. The simplicity and physical
transparency of the formalism further allows us to treat the multiple
reflection analytically and derive an analytical rule to construct the GF of a
general layered system. This could significantly reduce the computational time
and enable quantum transport calculations for large samples. We apply this
formalism to perform both analytical analysis and numerical simulation for the
two-dimensional conductance map of a realistic graphene p-n junction. The
results demonstrate the possibility of observing the spatially-resolved
interference pattern caused by negative refraction and further reveal a few
interesting features, such as the distance-independent conductance and its
quadratic dependence on the carrier concentration, as opposed to the linear
dependence in uniform graphene.

characterize more than 1400 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in this galaxy. Roughly 70\%
are new discoveries. We investigate the period-amplitude distribution and find
that Fornax shows a lack of High Amplitude (A$_V\gsim$0.75 mag) Short Period
fundamental-mode RRLs (P$\lsim$0.48 d, HASPs). These objects occur in stellar
populations more metal-rich than [Fe/H]$\sim$-1.5 and they are common in the
Galactic halo (Halo) and in globulars. This evidence suggests that old (age
older than 10 Gyr) Fornax stars are relatively metal-poor.
  A detailed statistical analysis of the role of the present-day Fornax dSph in
reproducing the Halo period distribution shows that it can account for only a
few to 20\% of the Halo when combined with RRLs in massive dwarf galaxies
(Sagittarius dSph, Large Magellanic Cloud). This finding indicates that
Fornax-like systems played a minor role in building up the Halo when compared
with massive dwarfs. We also discuss the occurrence of HASPs in connection with
the luminosity and the early chemical composition of nearby dwarf galaxies. We
find that, independently of their individual star formation histories, bright
(M$_V\lsim$-13.5 mag) galaxies have HASPs, whereas faint ones (M$_V\gsim$-11
mag) do not. Interestingly enough, Fornax belongs to a luminosity range
(--11$<$M$_V<$--13.5 mag) in which the occurrence of HASPs appears to be
correlated with the early star formation and chemical enrichment of the host
galaxy.

the continuous transitions of the translationally invariant ($M=2$) and

discontinuous for $M>2$. Furthermore, the temporal correlation length diverges
algebraically as the critical point is approached, but with different exponents

compatible with the bulk value, while in the inactive phase it exceeds the bulk

by a scaling theory with an irrelevant variable, which becomes dangerous in the

  Computation Offloading Using NFC","9 pages, 4 tables, 13 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing complexity of smartphone applications and services necessitate
high battery consumption but the growth of smartphones' battery capacity is not
keeping pace with these increasing power demands. To overcome this problem,
researchers gave birth to the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) research area. In
this paper we advance on previous ideas, by proposing and implementing the
first known Near Field Communication (NFC)-based computation offloading
framework. This research is motivated by the advantages of NFC's short distance
communication, with its better security, and its low battery consumption. We
design a new NFC communication protocol that overcomes the limitations of the
default protocol; removing the need for constant user interaction, the one-way
communication restraint, and the limit on low data size transfer. We present
experimental results of the energy consumption and the time duration of two
computationally intensive representative applications: (i) RSA key generation
and encryption, and (ii) gaming/puzzles. We show that when the helper device is
more powerful than the device offloading the computations, the execution time
of the tasks is reduced. Finally, we show that devices that offload application
parts considerably reduce their energy consumption due to the low-power NFC
interface and the benefits of offloading.

potential in other disciplines, but with only a handful of approaches explored
to date in software engineering, its potential in our field remains unclear. In
this paper, we explore how microtask crowdsourcing might serve as a means of
fault localization. We particularly take a first step in assessing whether a
crowd of workers can correctly locate known faults in a few lines of code (code
fragments) taken from different open source projects. Through Mechanical Turk,
we collected the answers of hundreds of workers to a pre-determined set of
template questions applied to the code fragments, with a replication factor of
twenty answers per question. Our findings show that a crowd can correctly
distinguish questions that cover lines of code that contain a fault from those
that do not. We also show that various filters can be applied to identify the
most effective subcrowds. Our findings also presented serious limitations in
terms of the proportion of lines of code selected for inspection and the cost
to collect answers. We describe the design of our experiment, discuss the
results, and provide an extensive analysis of different filters and their
effects in terms of speed, cost, and effectiveness. We conclude with a
discussion of limitations and possible future experiments toward more
full-fledged fault localization on a large scale involving more complex faults.

shear has effects of the order of percent or less, regardless of the model and
preserves a well known feature of clustering dark energy: When dark energy

promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models
trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural

actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face
this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to
dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and
classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic
training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e.,
crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by
tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is
possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial
agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used
to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed
methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation
architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real

effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.

thicker Ta layers a disoriented tetragonal beta-phase appears. Effective
spin-orbit torques are calculated based on harmonic Hall voltage measurements
performed in a temperature range between 15 and 300 K. To account for the
temperature dependence of damping-like and field-like torques, we extend the
spin diffusion model by including an additional contribution from the Ta/CoFeB
interface. Based on this approach, the temperature dependence of the spin Hall
angle in the Ta underlayer and at Ta/CoFeB interface are determined separately.
The results indicate an almost temperature-independent spin Hall angle of
theta_SH-N = -0.2 in Ta and a strongly temperature-dependent theta_SH-I for the
intermixed Ta/CoFeB interface.

  This gives a general frame work through which known results about modules

and properties of modules that satisfy the complete radical formula are given.
For instance, it is shown that a module that satisfies the complete radical
formula is completely semiprime if and only if it is a subdirect product of
completely prime modules. This generalizes a ring theoretical result: a ring is
reduced if and only if it is a subdirect product of domains. We settle in
affirmative a conjecture by Groenewald and the current author given in
\cite{2p} that a module over a 2-primal ring is 2-primal.
  More instances where 2-primal modules behave like modules over commutative

exhibiting tendencies of commutative rings. We end with some questions about
the role of 2-primal rings in algebraic geometry.

formation rate due to the ion-neutral drift. We performed ideal MHD simulations
that include the heating and cooling of the multiphase ISM, and where we treat
dynamically the formation of H2. In a post-processing step we compute the
abundances of species at chemical equilibrium. We show that CH+ is efficiently
formed at the edge of clumps, in regions where the H2 fraction is low, but
nevertheless higher than its equilibrium value, and where the gas temperature
is high. We show that warm and out of equilibrium H2 increases the integrated
column densities of CH+ by one order of magnitude, up to values still 3-10
times lower than those observed in the diffuse ISM. We balance the Lorentz
force with the ion-neutral drag to estimate the ion-drift velocities (vd). We
find that the vd distribution peaks around 0.04 km s-1, and that high vd are
too rare to have a significant statistical impact on the abundances of CH+.
Compared to previous works, our multiphase simulations reduce the spread in vd,
and our self-consistent treatment of the ionisation leads to much reduced vd.
Nevertheless, our resolution study shows that this velocity distribution is not
converged: the ion-neutral drift has a higher impact on CH+ at higher
resolution. On the other hand, our ideal MHD simulations do not include
ambipolar diffusion, which would yield lower drift velocities. Within these
limitations, we conclude that warm H2 is a key ingredient in the efficient
formation of CH+ and that the ambipolar diffusion has very little influence on
the abundance of CH+, mainly due to the small drift velocities obtained.
However, we point out that small-scale processes and other non-thermal
processes not included in our MHD simulation may be of crucial importance, and
higher resolution studies with better controlled dissipation processes are
needed.

clusters is the consequence of Emergent Gravity (EG). In this theory the
standard gravitational laws are modified on galactic and larger scales due to
the displacement of dark energy by baryonic matter. EG gives an estimate of the
excess gravity (described as an apparent dark matter density) in terms of the
baryonic mass distribution and the Hubble parameter. In this work we present
the first test of EG using weak gravitational lensing, within the regime of
validity of the current model. Although there is no direct description of
lensing and cosmology in EG yet, we can make a reasonable estimate of the
expected lensing signal of low redshift galaxies by assuming a background
LambdaCDM cosmology. We measure the (apparent) average surface mass density
profiles of 33,613 isolated central galaxies, and compare them to those
predicted by EG based on the galaxies' baryonic masses. To this end we employ
the ~180 square degrees overlap of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) with the
spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the
prediction from EG, despite requiring no free parameters, is in good agreement
with the observed galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles in four different stellar mass
bins. Although this performance is remarkable, this study is only a first step.
Further advancements on both the theoretical framework and observational tests
of EG are needed before it can be considered a fully developed and solidly
tested theory.

  potential on trees",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the first part of the article our subject of interest is a simple
symmetric random walk on the integers which faces a random risk to be killed.
This risk is described by random potentials, which in turn are defined by a
sequence of independent and identically distributed non-negative random
variables. To determine the risk of taking a walk in these potentials we
consider the decay of the Green function. There are two possible tools to
describe this decay: The quenched Lyapunov exponents and the annealed Lyapunov
exponents. It turns out that on the integers we can state a precise relation
between these two. The main tool for proving this is due to a special path
property on the integers: if the random walk travels from one point to another
one in finite time all the points between have to be passed in finite time as
well. This allows using Ergodic Theorems. In the second part we show that the
relation is also true in the case of Lyapunov exponents for simple symmetric
random walks on d-regular trees and for random walks with drift.

Hertzsprung--Russell diagram, on the main sequence. For that we computed
evolutionary models with the code STAREVOL for 15 < M/Msun < 100. We
subsequently calculated atmosphere models at specific points along the
evolutionary tracks, using the code CMFGEN. Synthetic spectra obtained in this
way were classified as if they were observational data. We tested our spectral
classification by comparison to observed spectra of various stars. We also
compared our results with empirical data of a large number of OB stars. We
obtain spectroscopic sequences along evolutionary tracks. In our computations,
the earliest O stars (O2-3.5) appear only above ~50 Msun. For later spectral
types, a similar mass limit exists, but is lower. A luminosity class V does not
correspond to the entire main sequence. This only holds for the 15 Msun track.
As mass increases, a larger portion of the main sequence is spent in luminosity
class III. Above 50 Msun, supergiants appear before the end of core-hydrogen
burning. Dwarf stars do not occur on the zero-age main sequence above 80 Msun.
Consequently, the distribution of luminosity class V in the HR diagram cannot
be used to constrain the size of the convective core. The distribution of
dwarfs and giants in the HR diagram agrees well with the location of stars
analyzed by means of quantitative spectroscopy. For supergiants, there is a
slight discrepancy in the sense that luminosity class I is observed slightly
earlier than our predictions. This is mainly due to wind densities that affect
the luminosity class diagnostic lines. We predict an upper mass limit for dwarf
stars (~60 Msun) that is found consistent with the rarity of O2V stars in the
Galaxy. Stars with WNh spectral type are not predicted by our models. Stronger
winds are required to produce the characteristic emission lines of these
objects.

social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as

offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that
social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as
offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social
networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social
connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user
retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about
400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the
effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous
increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that
social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior,
while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to
use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in
the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects
diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user
demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that
accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new

of models for modeling dependent data. While the early literature has shown
them to be powerful in capturing many network features of interest, recent work
highlights difficulties related to the models' ill behavior, such as most of
the probability mass being concentrated on a very small subset of the parameter
space. This behavior limits both the applicability of an ERGM as a model for
real data and inference and parameter estimation via the usual Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithms.
  To address this problem, we propose a new exponential family of models for
random graphs that build on the standard ERGM framework. Specifically, we solve
the problem of computational intractability and `degenerate' model behavior by
an interpretable support restriction. We introduce a new parameter based on the
graph-theoretic notion of degeneracy, a measure of sparsity whose value is
commonly low in real-worlds networks. The new model family is supported on the
sample space of graphs with bounded degeneracy and is called
degeneracy-restricted ERGMs, or DERGMs for short. Since DERGMs generalize ERGMs
-- the latter is obtained from the former by setting the degeneracy parameter
to be maximal -- they inherit good theoretical properties, while at the same
time place their mass more uniformly over realistic graphs.
  The support restriction allows the use of new (and fast) Monte Carlo methods
for inference, thus making the models scalable and computationally tractable.
We study various theoretical properties of DERGMs and illustrate how the
support restriction improves the model behavior. We also present a fast Monte
Carlo algorithm for parameter estimation that avoids many issues faced by
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms used for inference in ERGMs.

determine the transformation of the effective diffusivity tensor in inertial

one-dimensional spatial models, the effective diffusion coefficient $D$
measured in a frame $\Sigma$ moving with velocity $w$ with respect to the rest
frame of the stochastic process can be expressed as $D= D_0 \, \gamma^{-3}(w)$.
Subsequently, higher dimensional processes are analyzed, and it is shown that
the diffusivity tensor in a moving frame becomes non-isotropic with
$D_\parallel = D_0 \, \gamma^{-3}(w)$, and $D_\perp = D_0 \, \gamma^{-1}(w)$,
where $D_\parallel$ and $D_\perp$ are the diffusivities parallel and orthogonal
to the velocity of the moving frame. The analysis of discrete Space-Time
Diffusion processes permits to obtain a general transformation theory of the

Several implications of the theory are also addressed and discussed.

radius (1.9 Mpc) in the NE direction for the first time. The Suzaku temperature
map of the central region suggests a complex temperature distribution, which
agrees with previous work. Additionally, on a larger-scale, we confirm that the
temperature drops from 6 keV around the cluster center to 3 keV at the
outskirts, with two discontinuities at {\it r}$\sim$5\arcmin~(450 kpc) and
$\sim$12\arcmin~(1100 kpc) from the cluster center. Their locations coincide
with surface brightness discontinuities marginally detected in the XMM-Newton
image, which indicates the presence of shock structures. From the temperature
drop, we estimate the Mach numbers to be ${\cal M}_{\rm inner}\sim$1.2 and,
${\cal M}_{\rm outer}\sim$1.4. The first structure is most likely related to
the large cluster core region ($\sim$350--430 kpc), and its Mach number is
consistent with the XMM-Newton observation (${\cal M}\sim$1.24: Sakelliou &
Ponman 2006). Our detection of the second temperature jump, based on the Suzaku
key project observation, shows the presence of a shock structure across the NE
radio relic. This indicates a connection between the shock structure and the
relativistic electrons that generate radio emission. Across the NE radio relic,
however, we find a significantly lower temperature ratio
($T_1/T_2\sim1.44\pm0.16$ corresponds to~${\cal M}_{\rm X-ray}\sim1.4$) than
the value expected from radio wavelengths, based on the standard diffusive

Coulomb interaction alone worsens or does not correct this discrepancy. In
order to reproduce experiments, it is essential to account for the Coulomb
anisotropy. The latter is small but has strong effects; it competes with the
Coulomb-enhanced spin-orbit coupling and the isotropic Coulomb term in
determining the Fermi surface shape. Its effects are likely sizable in other
correlated multi-orbital systems. In addition, we find that the low-energy
self-energy matrix -- responsible for the reshaping of the Fermi surface --

by considering a generalization of the de Sitter group (the so called $q$-de

locally the one from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} group and that itself can be
recast in a Berwald form in an appropriate limit.

modelling of the reserve risk under Solvency II.
  We discuss two opposed perspectives on parameter uncertainty and point out
that standard methods of classical reserving focusing on the estimation error
of claims reserves are in general not appropriate to model the impact of
parameter uncertainty upon the actual risk of economic losses from the
undertakings's perspective.
  Referring to the requirements of Solvency II we assess methods to model
parameter uncertainty for the reserve risk by comparing the probability of
solvency actually attained when modelling the solvency risk capital requirement
based on the respective method to the required confidence level. Using the
simple example of a normal model we show that the bootstrapping approach is not
appropriate to model parameter uncertainty according to this criterion. We then
present an adaptation of the approach proposed in \cite {froehlich2014}.
Experimental results demonstrate that this new method yields a risk capital
model for the reserve risk achieving the required confidence level in good
approximation.

forced physicists to propose alternative dark matter (DM) models. One of the
most popular alternate explanations of the origin of DM is the non-thermal
production of DM via freeze-in. In this scenario the DM never attains thermal
equilibrium with the thermal soup because of its feeble coupling strength
($\sim 10^{-12}$) with the other particles in the thermal bath and is generally
called the Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP). In this work, we present
a gauged U(1)$_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) which
has a scalar FIMP DM candidate and can consistently explain the DM relic
density bound. In addition, the spontaneous breaking of the
U(1)$_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ gauge symmetry gives an extra massive neutral gauge
boson $Z_{\mu\tau}$ which can explain the muon ($g-2$) data through its
additional one-loop contribution to the process. Lastly, presence of three
right-handed neutrinos enable the model to successfully explain the small
neutrino masses via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The presence of the
spontaneously broken U(1)$_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ gives a particular structure to
the light neutrino mass matrix which can explain the peculiar mixing pattern of
the light neutrinos.

number of stones from each pile or make valid Nim moves. W. A. Wythoff proved
that the set of P-Positions (losing position), $C$, for Wythoff's Game is given
by $C := \left\{ (\lfloor k\phi \rfloor, \lfloor k\phi^2 \rfloor), (\lfloor
k\phi^2 \rfloor, \lfloor k\phi \rfloor) : k \in \mathbb Z_{\geq 0} \right\}$.
An open Wythoff problem remains where players make the valid Nim moves or
remove $kb$ stones from each pile, where $b$ is a fixed integer. We denote this
as the $(b,b)$ game. For example, regular Wythoff's Game is just the $(1,1)$
game. In 2009, Duch${\^e}$ne and Gravier proved an algorithm to generate the
set of P-Positions for the $(2,2)$ game by exploiting the periodic nature of
the differences of stones between the two piles modulo $4$. We observe similar
cyclic behaviour for any $b$, where $b$ is a power of $2$, modulo $b^2$, and
construct an algorithm to generate the set of P-Positions for this game. Let
$a$ be a power of $2$. We prove our algorithm works by first showing that it
holds for the first $a^2$ terms in the $(a,a)$ game. Next, we construct an
ordered multiset for the $(2a,2a)$ game from the $a^2$ terms, and an inductive
proof follows. Moreover, we conjecture that all cyclic games require $a$ to be
a power of $2$, suggesting that there is no similar structure in the
generalised $(b,b)$ game where $b$ isn't a power of $2$. Future directions for
generalising this result would likely utilise numeration systems, particularly
the PV numbers.

the black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found
that the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in
the statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the
thermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout
conditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite
chemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness
production in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle
production from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout
temperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full
equilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the
elementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average
temperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This
nearly removes the strangeness suppression. An extension to finite chemical
potentials is introduced. The particle ratios of kaon-to-pion, phi-to-kaon and
antilambda-to-pion are determined from Hawking-Unruh radiation and compared
with the thermal calculations and the measurements in different experiments. We
conclude that these particle ratios can be reproduced, at least qualitatively,
as Hawking-Unruh radiation at finite chemical potential. With increasing
energy, both K+/pi+ and phi/K^- keep their maximum values at low SPS energies.
But the further energy decrease rapidly reduces both ratios. For Lambda/pi-,
there is an increase with increasing collision energy, i.e. no saturation is to
be observed.

developed generalizing Finkelstein-Rubinstein theory for Skyrmions/kinks to
topological defects, and using nonabelian de Rham theorems. Two kinds of de
Rham theorems are discussed applicable to matrix valued differential forms, and
traces. Physical and mathematical interpretations of de Rham periods are
presented. It is suggested that Wilson lines and loop operators probe the local
properties of the topology, and spin as a topological invariant in pDIS
measurements could appear with any value from 0 to $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, i. e.
proton spin decomposition has no meaning in this approach.

the strong light-matter coupling regime supporting propagating polaritons. They
feature a normal mode splitting as large as 60 meV at low temperatures thanks
to the large overlap between the optical mode and the active region, a
polariton decay length up to 100 $\mu$m for photon-like polaritons and lifetime
of 1-2 ps; with the latter values being essentially limited by residual
absorption occurring in the waveguide. The fully lattice-matched nature of the
structure allows for very low disorder and high in-plane homogeneity; an
important asset for the realization of polaritonic integrated circuits that
could support nonlinear polariton wavepackets up to room temperature thanks to
the large exciton binding energy of 40 meV.

  Metal-Silicon Junctions","2016 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), in San
  Francisco",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contact resistance and thermal degradation of metal-silicon contacts are
challenges in nanoscale CMOS as well as in power device applications. Titanium
silicide (TiSi) contacts are commonly used metal-silicon contacts, but are
known to diffuse into the active region under high current stress. In this
paper we show that a graphenic carbon (C) contact deposited on n-type silicon
(C-Si) by CVD, has the same low Schottky barrier height of 0.45 eV as TiSi, but
a much improved reliability against high current stress. The C-Si contact is
over 100 million times more stable against high current stress pulses than the
conventionally used TiSi junction. The C-Si contact properties even show
promise to establish an ultra-low, high temperature stable contact resistance.
The finding has important consequences for the enhancement of reliability in
power devices as well as in Schottky-diodes and electrical contacts to silicon
in general.

process in an intense laser field is studied. The laser field is assumed to
consist of two consecutive short pulses, with a variable time delay in between.
By numerical calculations within the framework of scalar quantum
electrodynamics, we demonstrate that the time delay exerts a strong impact on
the pair-creation probability. For the case when both pulses are identical, the
effect is traced back to the relative quantum phase of the interfering S-matrix
amplitudes and explained within a simplified analytical model. Conversely, when
the two laser pulses differ from each other, the pair-creation probability
depends not only on the time delay but, in general, also on the temporal order
of the pulses.

data for regression, classification, and clustering. For regression and cluster
analyses of continuous data, MoE usually use normal experts following the
Gaussian distribution. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups
of observations with heavy tails or atypical observations, the use of normal
experts is unsuitable and can unduly affect the fit of the MoE model. We
introduce a robust MoE modeling using the $t$ distribution. The proposed $t$
MoE (TMoE) deals with these issues regarding heavy-tailed and noisy data. We
develop a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the
parameters of the proposed model by monotonically maximizing the observed data
log-likelihood. We describe how the presented model can be used in prediction
and in model-based clustering of regression data. The proposed model is
validated on numerical experiments carried out on simulated data, which show
the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model in terms of modeling
non-linear regression functions as well as in model-based clustering. Then, it
is applied to the real-world data of tone perception for musical data analysis,
and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate change data.
The obtained results show the usefulness of the TMoE model for practical
applications.
