Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for the rule diagram algebra. Our work lays

obtained over a $\sim2$ year period. The infrared emission lines were initially
symmetrical, with HWHM velocities of 525 km s$^{-1}$. In later
($t\gtrsim77$days, where $t$ is the time from outburst) spectra however, the
lines displayed a distinct asymmetry, with a much stronger blue wing, possibly
due to obscuration of the receding component by dust. Dust formation commenced
at $\sim$ day 34.75 at a condensation temperature of $1480\pm20$K, consistent
with graphitic carbon. Thereafter the dust temperature declined with time as
$T_{\rm d}\propto{t}^{-0.346}$, also consistent with graphitic carbon. The mass
of dust initally rose, as a result of an increase in grain size and/or number,
peaked at $\sim$ day 100, and then declined precipitously. This decline was
most likely caused by grain shattering due to electrostatic stress after the
dust was exposed to X-radiation. An Appendix summarises Planck Means for
carbon, and the determination of grain mass and radius for a carbon dust shell.

partition of G is a partition of its set of nodes such that each component is a
k-plex. A subset of nodes S is a k-plex if the degree of every node in the
associated induced subgraph is at least |S|-k. The maximum edge-weight k-plex
partitioning (Max-EkPP) problem is to find a k-plex partition with maximum
total weight, where the partition's weight is the sum of the weights on the
edges in the solution. When k=1, all components in the partition are cliques
and the problem becomes the well-known maximum edge-weight clique partitioning
(Max-ECP). However, and to our best knowledge, when k>1, the problem has never
been modeled. Actually, the literature on the k-plex addresses the search for a
single component in an unweighted graph. We propose a polynomial size integer
linear programming formulation for the Max-EkPP problem and consider the
inclusion of additional topological constraints in the model. These constraints
involve lower and upper limit capacity bounds in each component and upper bound
constraints on the number of components in the final solution. All these
characterizations preserve linearity and the initial polynomial size of the
model. We also present computational tests in order to show the models'
performance under different parameters' settings. These tests resort to
benchmark and real-world graphs.

learning algorithms with partial feedback) with the goal of creating a master
algorithm that performs almost as well as the best base algorithm if it were to
be run on its own. The main challenge is that when run with a master, base
algorithms unavoidably receive much less feedback and it is thus critical that
the master not starve a base algorithm that might perform uncompetitively
initially but would eventually outperform others if given enough feedback. We
address this difficulty by devising a version of Online Mirror Descent with a
special mirror map together with a sophisticated learning rate scheme. We show
that this approach manages to achieve a more delicate balance between
exploiting and exploring base algorithms than previous works yielding superior
regret bounds.
  Our results are applicable to many settings, such as multi-armed bandits,
contextual bandits, and convex bandits. As examples, we present two main
applications. The first is to create an algorithm that enjoys worst-case
robustness while at the same time performing much better when the environment
is relatively easy. The second is to create an algorithm that works
simultaneously under different assumptions of the environment, such as
different priors or different loss structures.

computation of numerical fluxes arising in the discretization of hyperbolic

unfiltered high-order scheme with the first-order Lax-Friedrichs method. The
activation of the low-order part of the scheme is driven by a measure of the
locally generated entropy inspired by the artificial-viscosity method proposed
by Guermond et al. Here, we present ELH in the context of high-order
finite-differencing methods and of the equations of general-relativistic
hydrodynamics. We study the performance of ELH in a series of classical
astrophysical tests in general relativity involving isolated, rotating and
nonrotating neutron stars, and including a case of gravitational collapse to
black hole. We present a detailed comparison of ELH with the fifth-order
monotonicity preserving method MP5, one of the most common high-order schemes
currently employed in numerical-relativity simulations. We find that ELH
achieves comparable and, in many of the cases studied here, better accuracy
than more traditional methods at a fraction of the computational cost (up to 50
% speedup). Given its accuracy and its simplicity of implementation, ELH is a
promising framework for the development of new special- and
general-relativistic hydrodynamics codes well adapted for massively parallel

$a$ = 4.9$^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ AU and $e$ = 0.59$^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$. Considering
random inclination angles, this object has $\gtrsim$ 65% probability to be
above the theoretical deuterium-burning limit, thus it is one of the few known
objects in the planet to brown-dwarf transition region. In addition, we
analyzed the Hipparcos astrometric data of this star, from which we derived a
minimum inclination angle for the companion of $\sim$ 2 deg. This value
corresponds to an upper mass limit of $\sim$ 0.3 M$_\odot$, therefore the
probability that HIP67537$\,b$ is stellar in nature is $\lesssim$ 7%. The large
mass of the host star and the high orbital eccentricity makes HIP67537$\,b$ a
very interesting and rare substellar object. This is the second candidate
companion in the brown dwarf desert detected in the sample of intermediate-mass
stars targeted by the EXPRESS radial velocity program, which corresponds to a
detection fraction of $f$ = 1.6$^{+2.0}_{-0.5}$%. This value is larger than the
fraction observed in solar-type stars, providing new observational evidence of
an enhanced formation efficiency of massive substellar companions in massive
disks. Finally, we speculate about different formation channels for this

consequence of these small-scale perturbations is generation of stochastic

difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) [26], the difficulty of the subproblems of
this algorithm depends heavily on the choice of DC decomposition. Simpler
subproblems can be obtained by using a specific DC decomposition described in
[27]. This decomposition has been proposed in numerous work such as [18], and
we refer to the resulting DCA as the proximal DCA. Although the subproblems are
simpler, the proximal DCA is the same as the proximal gradient algorithm when
the concave part of the objective is void, and hence is potentially slow in

accelerating the proximal gradient algorithm in the convex settings, we
consider a proximal difference-of-convex algorithm with extrapolation to
possibly accelerate the proximal DCA. We show that any cluster point of the

a macrocell BS (MBS) results in a two-tier hierarchical small cell network.
Cross-tier and inter-tier interference not only jeopardize primary macrocell
communication but also limit the spectral efficiency of small cell
communication. This paper focuses on distributed interference management for
downlink small cell networks. We address the optimization of transmit
strategies from both the game theoretical and the network utility maximization
(NUM) perspectives and show that they can be unified in a generalized Nash
equilibrium problem (GNEP) framework. Specifically, the small cell network
design is first formulated as a GNEP, where the SBSs and MBS compete for the
spectral resources by maximizing their own rates while satisfying global
quality of service (QoS) constraints. We analyze the GNEP via variational
inequality theory and propose distributed algorithms, which only require the
broadcasting of some pricing information, to achieve a generalized Nash
equilibrium (GNE). Then, we also consider a nonconvex NUM problem that aims to
maximize the sum rate of all BSs subject to global QoS constraints. We
establish the connection between the NUM problem and a penalized GNEP and show
that its stationary solution can be obtained via a fixed point iteration of the
GNE. We propose GNEP-based distributed algorithms that achieve a stationary
solution of the NUM problem at the expense of additional signaling overhead and
complexity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved and guaranteed
for properly chosen algorithm parameters. The proposed GNEP framework can scale
from a QoS constrained game to a NUM design for small cell networks by trading
off signaling overhead and complexity.

that spacetime and gravity may emerge from the entangled structure of an
underlying microscopic theory. In this picture, dark matter arises as a
response to the standard model of particle physics from the delocalized degrees
of freedom that build up the dark energy component of the Universe. Dark matter
physics is then regulated by a characteristic acceleration scale $a_0$,
identified with the radius of the (quasi)-de Sitter universe we inhabit. For a
point particle matter source, or outside an extended spherically symmetric
object, MOND's empirical fitting formula is recovered. However, Verlinde's
theory critically departs from MOND when considering the inner structure of
galaxies, differing by a factor of 2 at the centre of a regular massive body.
For illustration, we use the eight classical dwarf spheroidal satellites of the
Milky Way. These objects are perfect testbeds for the model given their
approximate spherical symmetry, measured kinematics, and identified missing
mass. We show that, without the assumption of a maximal deformation, Verlinde's
theory can fit the velocity dispersion profile in dwarf spheroidals with no
further need of an extra dark particle component. If a maximal deformation is
considered, the theory leads to mass-to-light ratios that are marginally larger
than expected from stellar population and formation history studies. We also
compare our results with the recent phenomenological interpolating MOND
function of McGaugh {\it et al}, and find a departure that, for these galaxies,
is consistent with the scatter in current observations.

break this degeneracy by combining microwave and sub-mm data from Planck with

Here, we demonstrate that for t-electric potential steps slowly varying with

nonperturbative character of QED calculations even in the absence of the exact

a universal character of vacuum effects caused by a strong electric field. In
the present article, we find universal approximate representations for the
total density of created pairs and vacuum mean values of the current density
and energy-momentum tensor that hold true for arbitrary t-electric potential
steps slowly varying with time. These representations do not require knowledge
of the corresponding solutions of the Dirac equation, they have a form of
simple functionals of a given slowly varying electric field. We establish
relations of these representations with leading terms of the derivative

semiclassical approximations that are not restricted by the smallness of

state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision,

shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force
misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to
subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and
could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.
  In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate
that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any
internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an
oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be
observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of
adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them.
We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a
small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our
proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of
misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even
these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities.
The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could
serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks.

texture and elongated grain shapes along the wire axis. This paper presents a
comprehensive study of the effective elastic behavior of this composite

for highly dependable services. It combines two schemes: a transaction is
executed either optimistically by only one service replica in the deferred
update mode (DU), or deterministically by all replicas in the state machine
mode (SM); the choice is made by an oracle. The DU mode allows for parallelism
and thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode
guarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations
and transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions
can be discarded or retried on demand. We formally prove that the higher
flexibility of the scheme does not come at the cost of weaker guarantees for
clients: HTR satisfies strong consistency guarantees akin to those provided by
other popular transactional replication schemes such as Deferred Update
Replication. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed
transactional memory system, and evaluated it thoroughly under various
workloads. We show the benefits of using a novel oracle, which relies on
machine learning techniques for automatic adaptation to changing conditions. In
our tests, the ML-based oracle provides up to 50% improvement in throughput
when compared to the system running with DU-only or SM-only oracles. Our
approach is inspired by a well known algorithm used in the context of the

modeling needs as data are influenced by local factors in addition to remote
phenomena, known as teleconnections. Teleconnections arise from complex
interactions between the atmosphere and ocean, of which the El Nino--Southern
Oscillation teleconnection is a well-known example. Our model extends the
standard geostatistical modeling framework to account for effects of covariates
observed on a spatially remote domain. We frame our model as an extension of
spatially varying coefficient models. Connections to existing methods are
highlighted and further modeling needs are addressed by additionally drawing on
spatial basis functions and predictive processes. Notably, our approach allows
users to model teleconnected data without pre-specifying teleconnection
indices, which other methods often require. We adopt a hierarchical Bayesian
framework to conduct inference and make predictions. The method is demonstrated
by predicting precipitation in Colorado while accounting for local factors and
teleconnection effects with Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures. We show how
the proposed model improves upon standard methods for estimating teleconnection
effects and discuss its utility for climate applications.

connection for dimer problems on bipartite and non-bipartite graphs. In the
bipartite case the connection is flat but has non-trivial ${\bf Z}_2$ holonomy
round certain curves. This holonomy has the universality property that it does
not change as the number of vertices in the fundamental domain of the graph is
increased. It is argued that the K-theory of the torus, with or without
punctures, is the appropriate underlying invariant. In the non-bipartite case
the connection has non-zero curvature as well as non-zero Chern number. The
curvature does not require the introduction of a magnetic field. The phase
diagram of these models is captured by what is known as an amoeba. We introduce
a dimer model with negative edge weights that give rise to vortices. The
amoebae for various models are studied with particular emphasis on the case of
negative edge weights which corresponds to the presence of vortices. Vortices
gives rise to new kinds of amoebae with certain singular structures which we
investigate. On the amoeba of the vortex full hexagonal lattice we find the
partition function corresponds to that of a massless Dirac doublet.

low-frequency oscillators, and for materials, such as Tungsten or Osmium, with
small quantum fluctuations of the constituent atoms around their lattice

Due to its fundamental role in chemical and biological processes, carbon is a
key element to trace. We aim to identify the carriers and processes behind the
extended NIR flux observed around several Herbig stars. We compare the extended
NIR flux from objects in the PIONIER Herbig Ae/Be survey with their flux in the
PAH features. HD 100453 is used as a benchmark case to investigate the
influence of quantum heated particles, like PAHs or very small carbonaceous
grains, in more detail. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCMax to
do a parameter study of the QHP size and scale- height and examine the
influence of quantum heating on the amount of extended flux in the NIR
visibilities. There is a correlation between the PAH feature flux of a disk and
the amount of its extended NIR flux. We find that very small carbonaceous
grains create the observed extended NIR flux around HD 100453 and still lead to
a realistic SED. These results can not be achieved without using quantum
heating effects, e.g. only with scattered light and grains in thermal
equilibrium. It is possible to explain the extended NIR emission around Herbig

intra-domain interactions involving the glycan attached to residue GluN1-N440

dimensional Dirac material (3DDM), to all orders of perturbation in tunneling,
induces a combination of s and p-wave pairing only. We show that the Lorentz
invariance of the superconducting pairing prevents the formation of Cooper
pairs with higher orbital angular momenta in the 3DDM. This no-go theorem
acquires stronger form when the probability of tunneling from the conventional
superconductor to positive and negative energy states of 3DDM are equal. In
this case all the p-wave contribution except for the lowest order, identically
vanish and hence we obtain an exact result for the induced p-wave
superconductivity in 3DDM. Fierz decomposing the superconducting matrix we find
that temporal component of the vector superconducting order and spatial
components of the pseudo-vector order are odd-frequency pairing. We find that
the latter is odd with respect to exchange of position and chirality of the
electrons in the Cooper pair and is spin-triplet which is necessary for NMR
detection of such an exotic pseudo- vector pairing. Moreover, we show that the

for gapless 3DDM the tensorial superconducting order will be the only order
which is odd with respect to the chemical potential {\mu}. Therefore we predict
that a transverse p-n junction binds Majorana fermions. This effect can be used
to control the neutral Majorana fermions with electric fields.

(MDAR) of disk galaxies. This is a tight empirical correlation between the disk
centripetal acceleration and that expected from the baryonic component. The
MDAR holds for most radii probed by disk kinematic tracers, regardless of
galaxy mass or surface brightness. The relation has two characteristic
accelerations; $a_0$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and
$a_{\rm min}$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in
isolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise
naturally in $\Lambda$CDM. This is because: (i) disk galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM
form at the centre of dark matter haloes spanning a relatively narrow range of
virial mass; (ii) cold dark matter halo acceleration profiles are self-similar
and have a broad maximum at the centre, reaching values bracketed precisely by
$a_{\rm min}$ and $a_0$ in that mass range; and (iii) halo mass and galaxy size
scale relatively tightly with the baryonic mass of a galaxy in any successful
$\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation model. Explaining the MDAR in $\Lambda$CDM does
not require modifications to the cuspy inner mass profiles of dark haloes,
although these may help to understand the detailed rotation curves of some
dwarf galaxies and the origin of extreme outliers from the main relation. The
MDAR is just a reflection of the self-similar nature of cold dark matter haloes
and of the physical scales introduced by the galaxy formation process.

examples of holography: their perturbative large-$N$ behavior is similar to the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, but they are fully quantum mechanical (in the
sense that there is no quenched disorder averaging). These facts make them
intriguing tentative models for quantum black holes. In this note, we
explicitly diagonalize the simplest non-trivial Gurau-Witten tensor model and
study its spectral and late-time properties. We find parallels to (a single
sample of) SYK where some of these features were recently attributed to random
matrix behavior and quantum chaos. In particular, after a running time average,
the spectral form factor exhibits striking qualitative similarities to SYK. But
we also observe that even though the spectrum has a unique ground state, it has
a huge (quasi-?)degeneracy of intermediate energy states, not seen in SYK. If
one ignores the delta function due to the degeneracies however, there is level
repulsion in the unfolded spacing distribution hinting chaos. Furthermore, the
spectrum has gaps and is not (linearly) rigid. The system also has a spectral
mirror symmetry which we trace back to the presence of a unitary operator with
which the Hamiltonian anticommutes. We use it to argue that to the extent that
the model exhibits random matrix behavior, it is controlled not by the Dyson
ensembles, but by the BDI (chiral orthogonal) class in the Altland-Zirnbauer
classification.

challenge concerning deletion codes is determining $p_0^{(adv)}$, the zero-rate
threshold of adversarial deletions, defined to be the supremum of all $p$ for
which there exists a code family with rate bounded away from 0 capable of
correcting a fraction $p$ of adversarial deletions. A recent construction of
deletion-correcting codes [Bukh et al 17] shows that $p_0^{(adv)} \ge
\sqrt{2}-1$, and the trivial upper bound, $p_0^{(adv)}\le\frac{1}{2}$, is the
best known. Perhaps surprisingly, we do not know whether or not $p_0^{(adv)} =
1/2$.
  In this work, to gain further insight into deletion codes, we explore two
related error models: oblivious deletions and online deletions, which are in
between random and adversarial deletions in power. In the oblivious model, the
channel can inflict an arbitrary pattern of $pn$ deletions, picked without
knowledge of the codeword. We prove the existence of binary codes of positive
rate that can correct any fraction $p < 1$ of oblivious deletions, establishing
that the associated zero-rate threshold $p_0^{(obliv)}$ equals $1$.
  For online deletions, where the channel decides whether to delete bit $x_i$
based only on knowledge of bits $x_1x_2\dots x_i$, define the deterministic
zero-rate threshold for online deletions $p_0^{(on,d)}$ to be the supremum of
$p$ for which there exist deterministic codes against an online channel causing
$pn$ deletions with low average probability of error. That is, the probability
that a randomly chosen codeword is decoded incorrectly is small. We prove
$p_0^{(adv)}=\frac{1}{2}$ if and only if $p_0^{(on,d)}=\frac{1}{2}$.

earlier sequence of work
\cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}, it is now well

further and established the so-called \emph{large deviations principle} (LDP)

solve for a variable Eddington factor (VEF) across the shock domain, which
allows for interesting physics not seen before in radiative-shock solutions.
Comparisons are made with the grey nonequilibrium-diffusion radiative-shock
solutions of Lowrie and Edwards [1], which assumed that the Eddington factor is
constant across the shock domain. It is our experience that the local Mach
number is monotonic when producing nonequilibrium-diffusion solutions, but that
this monotonicity may disappear while integrating the precursor region to
produce Sn-transport solutions. For temperature- and density-dependent cross
sections we show evidence of a spike in the VEF in the far upstream portion of
the radiative-shock precursor. We show evidence of an adaptation zone in the
precursor region, adjacent to the embedded hydrodynamic shock, as conjectured
by Drake [2, 3], and also confirm his expectation that the precursor
temperatures adjacent to the Zeldovich spike take values that are greater than
the downstream post-shock equilibrium temperature. We also show evidence that
the radiation energy density can be nonmonotonic under the Zeldovich spike,
which is indicative of anti-diffusive radiation flow as predicted by McClarren
and Drake [4]. We compare the angle dependence of the radiation flow for the
Sn-transport and nonequilibrium-diffusion radiation solutions, and show that
there are considerable differences in the radiation flow between these models
across the shock structure. Finally, we analyze the radiation flow to
understand the cause of the adaptation zone, as well as the structure of the
Sn-transport radiation-intensity solutions across the shock structure.

Selling the cloud to risk-averse customers","Appeared at WINE 2016",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Amazon EC2, cloud resources are sold through a combination of an on-demand
market, in which customers buy resources at a fixed price, and a spot market,
in which customers bid for an uncertain supply of excess resources. Standard
market environments suggest that an optimal design uses just one type of
market. We show the prevalence of a dual market system can be explained by
heterogeneous risk attitudes of customers. In our stylized model, we consider
unit demand risk-averse bidders. We show the model admits a unique equilibrium,
with higher revenue and higher welfare than using only spot markets.
Furthermore, as risk aversion increases, the usage of the on-demand market
increases. We conclude that risk attitudes are an important factor in cloud
resource allocation and should be incorporated into models of cloud markets.

analyzing the behavior in a zone around the breaking points in a sense

some benefits, but also with some controversial concerns. Many approaches to
develop a consistent varying speed of light (VSL) theory have been developed
recently. Although a lot of theoretical debate has sprout out about their
feasibility and reliability, the most obvious and straightforward way to
discriminate and check if such theories are really workable has been missed out
or not fully employed. What is meant here is the comparison of these theories
with observational data in a fully comprehensive way. In this paper we try to
address this point i.e., by using the most updated cosmological probes, we test
three different candidates for a VSL theory (Barrow \& Magueijo, Avelino \&
Martins, and Moffat) signal. We consider many different ans\""{a}tze for both
the functional form of $c(z)$ (which cannot be fixed by theoretical
motivations) and for the dark energy dynamics, in order to have a clear global
picture from which we extract the results. We compare these results using a
reliable statistical tool such as the Bayesian Evidence. We find that the
present cosmological data is perfectly compatible with any of these VSL
scenarios, but in one case (Moffat model) we have a higher Bayesian Evidence
ratio in favour of VSL than in the standard $c=$ constant $\Lambda$CDM
scenario. Moreover, in such a scenario, the VSL signal can help to strengthen
constraints on the spatial curvature (with indication toward an open universe),
to clarify some properties of dark energy (exclusion of a cosmological constant
at $2\sigma$ level) and is also falsifiable in the nearest future due to some
peculiar issues which differentiate this model from the standard model.

  We use a sample of 126 \textit{Swift} GRBs, that we have selected among more
than 800 long bursts observed until April 2015. The selection is based on a few
observational constraints: GRB flux higher than 0.4 $photons/cm^2/s$ in the
band 15-150 keV, spectrum fitted with simple power law, redshift accurately
known and given, and X-ray afterglow observed and flux measured.
  The statistical method of maximum likelihood is then used to determine the
best cosmological parameters ($\Omega_M$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$) that give the
best correlation for two relations: a) the Amati relation (between intrinsic
spectral peak energy $E_{p,i}$ and the equivalent isotropic energy), b) the
Dainotti relation, namely between the X-ray afterglow luminosity $L_X$ and the
break time $T_a$, which is observed in the X-ray flux FX.
  Although the number of GRBs with high redshifts is rather small, and despite
the notable dispersion found in the data, the results we have obtained are
quite encouraging and promising. The results obtained using the Amati relation
are close to those obtained using the Type Ia supernovae, and they appear to
indicate a universe dominated by dark energy. However, those obtained with the
correlation between the break time and the X-ray afterglow luminosity is
consistent with the findings of the WMAP study of the cosmic microwave
background radiation, and they seem to indicate a de Sitter-Einstein universe
dominated by matter.

star-forming clouds, comparing the resultant star formation in both idealised
profiles and more realistic cloud structures drawn from a global galaxy
simulation. We performed a series of numerical simulations which compared the
effect of star formation alone, photoionisation and photoionisation plus
supernovae feedback. In the idealised cloud, photoionisation suppresses gas
fragmentation at early times, resulting in the formation of more massive stars
and an increase in the star formation efficiency. At later times, the dispersal
of the dense gas causes the radiative feedback effect to switch from positive
to negative as the star formation efficiency drops. In the cloud extracted from
the global simulation, the initial cloud is heavily fragmented prior to the
stellar feedback beginning and is largely structurally unaffected by the late
injection of radiation energy. The result is a suppression of the star
formation. We conclude that the efficiency of feedback is heavily dependent on
the gas structure, with negative feedback dominating when the density is high.

different exotic features in their electronic structures. These originate from
forced band degeneracies caused by the non-symmorphic symmetry, which not only
creates the possibility to realize Dirac semimetals, but also recently resulted
in the prediction of novel quasiparticles beyond the usual Dirac, Weyl or
Majorana fermions, which can only exist in the solid state. Experimental
realization of non-symmorphic materials that have the Fermi level located at
the degenerate point is difficult, however, due to the requirement of an odd
band filling. In order to investigate the effect of forced band degeneracies on
the transport behavior, a material that has such a degeneracy at or close to
the Fermi level is desired. Here, we show with angular resolved photoemission
experiments supported by density functional calculations, that ZrSiTe hosts
several fourfold degenerate Dirac crossings at the X point, resulting from
non-symmorphic symmetry. These crossings form a Dirac line node along XR, which
is located almost directly at the Fermi level and shows almost no dispersion in
energy. ZrSiTe is thus the first real material that allows for transport
measurements investigating Dirac fermions that originate from non-symmorphic
symmetry.

non-thermal electrons. In this paper we examine the consequences that such a
hybrid (thermal/non-thermal) EED has on the spectrum of blazars. Since the
thermal component of the EED may extend to very low energies. We replace the
standard synchrotron process by the more general magneto-bremsstrahlung (MBS).
Significant differences in the energy flux appear at low radio frequencies when
considering MBS instead of the standard synchrotron emission. A drop in the
spectrum appears in the all the radio band and a prominent valley between the
infrared and soft X-rays bands when a hybrid EED is considered, instead of a
power-law EED. In the $\gamma$-ray band an EED of mostly thermal particles
displays significant differences with respect to the one dominated by
non-thermal particles. A thermally-dominated EED produces a synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) peak extending only up to a few MeV, and the valley
separating the MBS and the SSC peaks is much deeper than if the EED is
dominated by non-thermal particles. The combination of these effects modifies
the Compton dominance of a blazar, suggesting that the vertical scatter in the
distribution of FSRQs and BL Lac objects in the peak synchrotron frequency -
Compton dominance parameter space could be attributed to different proportions
of thermal/non-thermal particles in the EED of blazars. Finally, the
temperature of the electrons in the shocked plasma is shown to be a degenerated
quantity for different magentizations of the ejected material.

a vital role in shaping galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe.
One key remaining issue is the final fate of secondary protostars formed in the
accretion disc, specifically whether they merge or survive. We perform a suite
of hydrodynamic simulations of the complex interplay between fragmentation,
protostellar accretion, and merging inside dark matter minihaloes. Instead of
the traditional sink particle method, we employ a stiff equation of state
approach, so that we can more robustly ascertain the viscous transport inside
the disc. The simulations show inside-out fragmentation because the gas
collapses faster in the central region. Fragments migrate on the viscous
timescale, over which angular momentum is lost, enabling them to move towards
the disc centre, where merging with the primary protostar can occur. This
process depends on the fragmentation scale, such that there is a maximum scale
of $(1 - 5) \times 10^4$ au, inside which fragments can migrate to the primary
protostar. Viscous transport is active until radiative feedback from the
primary protostar destroys the accretion disc. The final mass spectrum and
multiplicity thus crucially depends on the effect of viscosity in the disc. The
entire disc is subjected to efficient viscous transport in the primordial case
with viscous parameter $\alpha \le 1$. An important aspect of this question is
the survival probability of Pop III binary systems, possible gravitational wave
sources to be probed with the Advanced LIGO detectors.

months of NuSTAR operation, which provide ~20Ms of effective exposure time over
331 fields, with an areal coverage of 13 sq deg, and 497 sources detected in
total over the 3-24 keV energy range. There are 276 sources with spectroscopic
redshifts and classifications, largely resulting from our extensive campaign of
ground-based spectroscopic followup. We characterize the overall sample in
terms of the X-ray, optical, and infrared source properties. The sample is
primarily comprised of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), detected over a large
range in redshift from z = 0.002 - 3.4 (median of <z> = 0.56), but also
includes 16 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. There is a large
range in X-ray flux, from log( f_3-24keV / erg s^-1 cm^-2 ) ~ -14 to -11, and
in rest-frame 10-40 keV luminosity, from log( L_10-40keV / erg s^-1 ) ~ 39 to
46, with a median of 44.1. Approximately 79% of the NuSTAR sources have lower
energy (<10 keV) X-ray counterparts from XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Swift/XRT.
The mid-infrared (MIR) analysis, using WISE all-sky survey data, shows that MIR
AGN color selections miss a large fraction of the NuSTAR-selected AGN
population, from ~15% at the highest luminosities (Lx > 10^44 erg s^-1) to ~80%
at the lowest luminosities (Lx < 10^43 erg s^-1). Our optical spectroscopic
analysis finds that the observed fraction of optically obscured AGNs (i.e., the
Type 2 fraction) is F_Type2 = 53(+14-15)%, for a well-defined subset of the
8-24 keV selected sample. This is higher, albeit at a low significance level,
than the Type 2 fraction measured for redshift- and luminosity-matched AGNs
selected by <10 keV X-ray missions.

J213907.42+222708.9. However, these are among the few ELM Survey objects that
do not show radial velocity variations to confirm the binary nature expected of

J135512.34+195645.4 far exceeds the theoretical cutoff for surface reflection
in a white dwarf, and this target is likely a high-amplitude delta Scuti
pulsator with an overestimated surface gravity. We estimate the probability to
be less than 0.0008 that the lack of measured radial velocity variations in
four of eight other pulsating candidate ELM white dwarfs could be due to low
orbital inclination. Two other targets exhibit variability as photometric
binaries. Partial coverage of the 19.342-hr orbit of WD J030818.19+514011.5
reveals deep eclipses that imply a primary radius > 0.4 solar radii--too large
to be consistent with an ELM white dwarf. The only object for which our time
series photometry adds support to the ELM white dwarf classification is SDSS
J105435.78-212155.9, with consistent signatures of Doppler beaming and
ellipsoidal variations. We interpret that the ELM Survey contains multiple

Weyl matter using the formalism of the consistent chiral kinetic theory. It is
argued that the helicon dispersion relations are affected by the electric and
chiral chemical potentials, the chiral shift, and the energy separation between
the Weyl nodes. The effects of multiple pairs of Weyl nodes are also discussed.
A simple setup for experimental detection of pseudomagnetic helicons is
proposed.

dispersion 2.7 +/- 0.3 km/s about mean velocity of 87.5 +/- 0.4 km/s. We also
resolve a metallicity dispersion 0.22 about a mean of [Fe/H]=-1.98 +/- 0.1 that
is 0.28 +/- 0.14 poorer than is estimated from photometry. Despite Crater 2's
relatively large size (projected halflight radius R(h)=1 kpc) and intermediate
luminosity (M_V =-8), its velocity dispersion is the coldest that has been
resolved for any dwarf galaxy. These properties make Crater 2 the most extreme
low-density outlier in dynamical as well as structural scaling relations among
the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidals. Even so, under assumptions of dynamical
equilibrium and negligible contamination by unresolved binary stars, the
observed velocity distribution implies a gravitationally dominant dark matter

enclosed within a radius of 1 kpc, where the equivalent circular velocity is
4.3 km/s.

cosmic ultraviolet background radiation at early epochs. However, observing and
characterizing the galaxy population with significant ionizing emission has
proven to be challenging. In particular, the fraction of ionizing radiation
that escapes the local environment to the intergalactic medium is poorly known.
We investigate the relation between the escape fraction and galaxy luminosity.
We combine the deep ultraviolet observations of Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF)
with the deep Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of the same
field, collecting a sample of 165 faint star forming galaxies in the $3 < z <
4$ redshift range with deep rest-frame observations of the Lyman continuum. In
our sample, we do not find any galaxy with significant emission of LyC
radiation. We bin the galaxies in various redshift and brightness intervals and
stack their images. From stacked images we estimate the relative escape
fraction upper limits as a function of the luminosity. Thanks to the depth of
the sample we measure meaningful 1$\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{esc,rel} < 0.07,
0.2$ and 0.6 at $L \sim L_{\rm z=3}^{*}, 0.5L_{\rm z=3}^{*}$ and $0.1L_{\rm

the literature to study a possible dependence of the escape fraction on galaxy
luminosity by modelling the ionizing background with different prescriptions of
$f_{\rm esc} (M_{\rm UV})$. We show that the understanding of the luminosity
dependence hinges on the ability to constrain the escape fraction down to
$M_{\rm UV} \sim -18$ mag in the future.

converges to an extension of the preferential attachment model---in this sense,
it can be motivated alternatively by asking what preferential attachment is an
approximation to. Theoretical properties, including the limiting degree
sequence, are studied analytically. If the entire history of the graph is
observed, parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood. If only the final
graph is available, its history can be imputed using MCMC. We develop a class
of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms that are more generally applicable to
sequential network models, and may be of interest in their own right. The model
parameters can be recovered from a single graph generated by the model.
Applications to data clarify the role of the random walk length as a length

relies on the [Ar III]/[Ne III] emission line ratio to break the oxygen
abundance bimodality. In doing so, we can measure oxygen and nitrogen
abundances without assuming any a priori relation between N/O and O/H. The
second novelty is that BOND takes into account changes in the hardness of the

hardness of the ionizing radiation field. Finally, we also stress the pragmatic
considerations behind our Bayesian inference.

observational evidence that open clusters display a decreasing trend of their
barium abundances as a function of the cluster's age. Young clusters (ages~200
Myr) exhibit significant enhancement in the [Ba/Fe] ratios, at variance with
solar-age clusters where the Ba content has been found to be [Ba/Fe]~0 dex.
Different viable solutions have been suggested in the literature, nevertheless,
a conclusive interpretation of such a peculiar trend has not been found.
Interestingly, it is debated whether the other species produced with Ba via
s-process reactions do follow the same trend with age. Pre-main sequence
clusters (~10-50 Myr) show the most extreme behaviour in this respect: their
[Ba/Fe] ratios can reach 0.65 dex, which higher than the solar value by a
factor of four. Crucially, there are no investigations of the other s-process
species for these young stellar populations. In this paper we present, the
first determination of Y, Zr, La, and Ce in clusters IC 2391, IC 2602 and the
Argus association. The main objective of our work is to ascertain whether these
elements reveal the same enhancement as Ba. Our results indicate that, at
variance with Ba, all the other s-process species exhibit a solar scaled
pattern: these clusters confirm a similar trend discovered in the slightly
older local associations (e.g., AB Doradus, Carina Near), where only Ba exhibit
enhanced value with all other s process species being solar. We have discussed
several possible explanations such as e.g., chromospheric effects, departures
from the LTE approximation, or the activation of a different nucleosynthesis
chain. We cannot currently provide the definite answer to this question and
future investigations from theoretical and observational perspectives are
sorely needed.

appears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective
temperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of
Kepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to
cold-trap processes in the planet's atmosphere. Using a toy model for where
cold-traps should inhibit inversions, and observations of other planets in this
temperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more
detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful

dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has triggered renewed interest of localized excitons in
low-dimensional systems. Open questions remain about the microscopic origin
previously attributed to dopants and/or defects as well as strain potentials.
Here we show that the quantum emitters can be deliberately induced by
nanobubble formation in WSe2 and BN/WSe2 heterostructures. Correlations of
atomic-force microscope and hyperspectral photoluminescence images reveal that
the origin of quantum emitters and trion disorder is extrinsic and related to
10 nm tall nanobubbles and 70 nm tall wrinkles, respectively. We further
demonstrate that hot stamping results in the absence of 0D quantum emitters and
trion disorder. The demonstrated technique is useful for advances in nanolasers
and deterministic formation of cavity-QED systems in monolayer materials.

supersymmetry is broken at a very high scale, Super Heavy Gravitino Dark Matter
(SHGDM) and Starobinsky's inflation can be coherently unified in a $R+\zeta

Particles (LSP) and are non-thermally produced during inflation, in turn
originated by a scalar with a Starobinsky's potential. Gravitino mass runs with
the inflaton field, so that a continuos spectrum of superheavy gravitinos
emerges. The theory is implemented with a $U(1)_{R}$ gauge symmetry. However,
in a string UV completion, $U(1)_{R}$-symmetry can be broken by
non-perturbative string instantons, while for consistency of our scenario
$U(1)_{R}$ gauge symmetry breaking must be broken in order to generate a soft
mass terms for the gravitino and gauginos. R-parity violating operators can be
generated at non-perturbative level. Gravitinos can decay into very energetic
neutrinos and photons in cosmological time scale, with intriguing implications
for high energy cosmic rays experiments.

It builds upon prior work about the space of continuous functions on the unit

complexity classes and proved that it is the weakest second-order
representation such that evaluation is polynomial-time computable. The first
part of this paper provides a similar representation for the space of
integrable functions on a bounded subset of Euclidean space: The weakest
representation rendering integration over boxes is polynomial-time computable.
In contrast to the representation of continuous functions, however, this
representation turns out to be discontinuous with respect to both the norm and
the weak topology. The second part modifies the representation to be continuous
and generalizes it to Lp-spaces. The arising representations are proven to be
computably equivalent to the standard representations of these spaces as metric
spaces and to still render integration polynomial-time computable. The family
is extended to cover Sobolev spaces on the unit interval, where less basic
operations like differentiation and some Sobolev embeddings are shown to be
polynomial-time computable. Finally as a further justification quantitative
versions of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli and Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov Theorems are presented
and used to argue that these representations fulfill a minimality condition. To
provide tight bounds for the Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov Theorem, a form of

satellites' orbits evolve losing energy and angular momentum, with no clear
trend towards orbit circularization. The distributions of the orbital
parameters of the central-satellite encounters are markedly different from the
distributions found for halo-halo mergers in cosmological simulations. The
orbits of satellites accreted by the CGs are on average less bound and less
eccentric than those of cosmological halo-halo encounters. We provide fits to
the distributions of the central-satellite merging orbital parameters that can
be used to study the merger-driven evolution of the scaling relations of CGs.

strict lower limit to the true radial velocity semi-amplitude $K_2$. Combining
our donor constraint with the well constrained orbit of the neutron star leads
to a determination of the binary mass ratio: q = $0.123^{+0.012}_{-0.010}$. The
component masses are not tightly constrained given our lack of knowledge of the

the effects of magnetic fields on the energy transport and structure of
radiation pressure dominated main sequence massive star envelopes at the region
of the iron opacity peak. We focus on the regime where the local thermal
timescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient
convective energy transport. We begin with initially weak magnetic fields
relative to the thermal pressure, from 100-1000G in differing geometries. The
unstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the
magnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent
kinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's
presence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent
envelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons
to diffuse out through low density regions. Magnetic buoyancy brings small
scale magnetic fields to the photosphere and increases the vertical energy
transport with the energy advection velocity proportional to the Alfv\'en
velocity, although in all cases we study photon diffusion still dominates the
energy transport. The increased radiative and advective energy transport causes
the stellar envelope to shrink by several scale heights. We also find larger
turbulent velocity fluctuations compared to the purely hydrodynamic case,
reaching $\approx$ 100 km/s at the stellar photosphere. The photosphere also
shows vertical oscillations with similar averaged velocities and periods of a

geometry and its application to image analysis. The descriptors are provided by
estimating the triangular prism fractal dimension under different scales with a
weight exponential parameter, followed by dimensionality reduction using
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transform. The efficiency of the proposed descriptors is
tested on two well-known texture data sets, that is, Brodatz and Vistex, both
for classification and image retrieval. The novel method is also tested
concerning invariances in situations when the textures are rotated or affected
by Gaussian noise. The obtained results outperform other classical and

triangular descriptors in these tasks, suggesting their use in practical
applications of image analysis based on texture features.

retinal thickness from a variety of clinically used Spectral-Domain Optical
Coherence Tomography scanners. DESIGN: Retinal images from five Spectral-Domain
Optical Coherence Tomography scanners were used to determine total retinal
thickness with scanner-specific correction factors establishing consistency of
thickness measurement across devices. PARTICIPANTS: 55 Fovea-centered
Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography volumes from eleven subjects were
analyzed, obtained from Cirrus HD-OCT, RS-3000, Heidelberg Spectralis, RTVue
and Topcon2000, seven subjects with retinal diseases and four normal controls.
METHOD: The Iowa Reference Algorithm measured total retinal thickness.
Nonlinear model of total retinal thickness measurement comparisons was derived
and used for device-specific comparisons. Bland-Altman plots and pairwise
predictive equations yielded pairwise scanner-specific differences. Mendel test
determined whether measurement biases were constant for each scanner pair.
RESULTS: Mendel test revealed that all pairwise scanner differences of total
retinal thickness were constant across the cohort (p=0.992). Individual
measurements can thus be bias-corrected and the Iowa Reference Algorithm serve
as a scanner-agnostic independent standard of total retinal thickness across
the five tested SD-OCT scanners. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of the Iowa Reference
Algorithm with scanner-specific bias correction yields cross-scanner
consistency of total retinal thickness measurements, facilitating
scanning-device independent quantitative assessment of total retinal thickness,
longitudinal follow-up quantification without requiring patients to be imaged
on the same scanner model, and allowing for multi-center studies with
heterogeneous device utilization when using the Iowa Reference Algorithm.

refers to a coupling of NLSM pions to bi-adjoint scalars, and the semi-abelian

characterize the Z-theory amplitudes. Alternatively, the partial symmetrization
corresponds to a mixed interaction among abelian and non-abelian states in the

monodromy relations which greatly increase the efficiency in extracting the

higher-derivative interactions between NLSM pions and bi-colored scalars all of

One parameter choice corresponds to bosonic string theory, another to heterotic
string theory. These results are generalized to second order in perturbation
theory by a Noether procedure. Using consistency conditions derived from the
Jacobi identity, it is shown that for general $a, b$ there is no generalized

given by a frame formalism, with $\alpha'$-deformed frame transformations, as
proposed by Marques and Nunez. Their construction is slightly generalized to an

around flat space is matched to second order with the results obtained by the

of written or printed text where the letters have faded, either due to
deliberate erasing or simply due to the ravages of time. Often the text can be
read simply by looking at individual wavelengths, but in some cases the images
need further enhancement to maximise the chances of reading the text. There are
many possible enhancement techniques and this paper assesses and compares an
extended set of dimensionality reduction methods for image processing. We
assess 15 dimensionality reduction methods in two different manuscripts. This
assessment was performed both subjectively by asking the opinions of scholars
who were experts in the languages used in the manuscripts which of the
techniques they preferred and also by using the Davies-Bouldin and Dunn indexes
for assessing the quality of the resulted image clusters. We found that the
Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) method which was using a Matlab
implementation and we have used previously to enhance multispectral images, it
was indeed superior to all the other tested methods. However it is very likely
that other approaches will be more suitable in specific circumstance so we
would still recommend that a range of these techniques are tried. In
particular, CVA is a supervised clustering technique so it requires
considerably more user time and effort than a non-supervised technique such as
the much more commonly used Principle Component Analysis Approach (PCA). If the
results from PCA are adequate to allow a text to be read then the added effort
required for CVA may not be justified. For the purposes of comparing the
computational times and the image results, a CVA method is also implemented in
C programming language and using the GNU (GNUs Not Unix) Scientific Library

Gravitational screening is modeled effectively through the attachment of a
suppression factor to the linearized Klein-Gordon equations.
  The adapted COLA approach is benchmarked, with respect to an N-body code both
for the $\Lambda$CDM scenario and for the modified gravity theories. It is
found to perform well in the estimation of the dark matter power spectra, with
consistency of 1 % to $k\sim2.5$ h/Mpc. Redshift space distortions are shown to
be effectively modeled through a Lorentzian parameterization with a velocity
dispersion fit to the data. We find that COLA performs less well in predicting
the halo mass functions, but has consistency, within $1\sigma$ uncertainties of
our simulations, in the relative changes to the mass function induced by the
modified gravity models relative to $\Lambda$CDM.

molecular gas torus with a radius of $r\sim30$ pc; inside the torus, we found a
compact source of dust continuum at 0.87 mm and CO, coincident with the
location of the low-luminosity AGN revealed by X-ray observations; (2) the
excitation of CO gas, traced by the line intensity ratio of CO (3-2) to CO

and 1 in the 500 pc ring; (3) the ratio of HCN (1-0) to HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) in the
central 1 kpc exhibits a radial gradient: while the ratio decreases from
$\sim1.5$ in the center to $\sim0.9$ in the 500 pc disk, it exhibits a peak of
$\sim1.2$ in a ring-like structure at a galactocentric radius of $r\sim300$ pc.
The detection of SiO (2-1) in the circumnuclear disk suggests the presence of
shocks, likely generated by intense nuclear star formation (supernova
explosions and winds from massive stars), as well as inflows and outflows of
turbulent gas in the central 100 pc.

is known that the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is characterized
by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest
Schmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced
density operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit
novel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings. In the multi-copy
regime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly
super-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of
two tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their
maximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those
tripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative
when taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on
determining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate,
which turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt
rank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal
Schmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative
property, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal
Schmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states, by resorting
to certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of
matrix semi-invariants. These formulas give a sufficient and necessary
condition to determine whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed
to the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in the asymptotic
setting. Applying the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, we
can verify this condition in deterministic polynomial time.

strength (transition points), between which the incoherent state is linearly
stable and is unstable otherwise. We show that the transition points depend on
the largest positive or/and smallest negative eigenvalue(s) of the kernel
operator defined by the graph limit. This reveals the precise mechanism, by
which the network topology controls transition to synchrony in the Kuramoto

mass-size relation of ETGs at $z \sim 0.25-0.75$, while the outer component

real physical differences between the single- and double-component ETGs, with
the double-component galaxies being younger and more metal-rich. The fraction
of double component ETGs increases with increasing $\sigma$ and decreases in
denser environments. We hypothesize that double-component systems were able to
accrete gas and small galaxies until later times, boosting their central
densities, building up their outer parts, and lowering their typical central
ages. In contrast, the oldest galaxies, perhaps due to residing in richer

many applications in automated image processing. A recent technique called

representation where similar pixels are pulled close together and dissimilar
pixels are pushed apart. This technique has shown promising results, but its
original formulation is not computationally feasible for large images. We
propose two improvements to the algorithm for computing PFE: first, we
reformulate portions of the algorithm to enable various linear algebra
operations to be performed in parallel; second, we propose utilizing an
iterative linear solver (preconditioned conjugate gradient) to quickly solve a
linear least-squares problem that occurs in the inner loop of a nested
iteration. With these two computational improvements, we show on a publicly

arrested coalescence has been investigated using micromanipulation experiments.
Addition of a third droplet to arrested droplet doublets is shown to be
controlled by the balance between interfacial pressures driving coalescence and
internal elasticity that resists total consolidation. The free fluid available
within the droplets controls the transmission of stress during droplet
combination and allows connections to occur via formation of a neck between the
droplets. The anisotropy of three-droplet systems adds complexity to the
symmetric case of two-droplet aggregates because of the multiplicity of
orientations possible for the third droplet. When elasticity dominates, the
initial orientation of the third droplet is preserved in the triplet's final
shape. When elasticity is dominated by the interfacial driving force, the final
shape can deviate strongly from the initial positioning of droplets. Movement
of the third droplet to a more compact packing occurs, driven by liquid
meniscus expansion that minimizes the surface energy of the triplet. A range of
compositions and orientations are examined and the resulting domains of
restructuring and stability are mapped based on the final triplet structure. A
geometric and a physical model are used to explain the mechanism driving
meniscus-induced restructuring and are related to the impact of these phenomena
on multiple droplet emulsions.

service hosting, yet it also draws concerns of the unpredictable performance of
cloud-based services due to network congestion. To offer predictable
performance, the virtual cluster abstraction of cloud services has been
proposed, which enables allocation and performance isolation regarding both
computing resources and network bandwidth in a simplified virtual network
model. One issue arisen in virtual cluster allocation is the survivability of
tenant services against physical failures. Existing works have studied virtual
cluster backup provisioning with fixed primary embeddings, but have not
considered the impact of primary embeddings on backup resource consumption. To
address this issue, in this paper we study how to embed virtual clusters
survivably in the cloud data center, by jointly optimizing primary and backup
embeddings of the virtual clusters. We formally define the survivable virtual
cluster embedding problem. We then propose a novel algorithm, which computes
the most resource-efficient embedding given a tenant request. Since the optimal
algorithm has high time complexity, we further propose a faster heuristic
algorithm, which is several orders faster than the optimal solution, yet able
to achieve similar performance. Besides theoretical analysis, we evaluate our
algorithms via extensive simulations.

Recently, Marques and Neves used the $p$-width to prove the existence of
infinite many minimal hypersurfaces in compact manifolds with positive Ricci

this chiral algebra to have a dual description as a subsector of IIB
supergravity on $AdS_5 \times S^5$. This subsector can be carved out by a
version of supersymmetric localization, using the bulk analog of the boundary
supercharge. We illustrate this procedure in a simple model, the theory of an

of the full $AdS_5 \times S^5$ supergravity, in which case the vector multiplet

initially achieved in \cite{CRT,DOnoho06CS} and later on perfected in
\cite{DonohoPol,DonohoUnsigned,StojnicCSetam09,StojnicUpper10}. The success

strongly affected by non-Hermitian terms that arise from an effective
description of system-enviroment interaction. A simple and paradigmatic example
of non-Hermitian transport, originally introduced by Hatano and Nelson two
decades ago [N. Hatano and D.R. Nelson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 570 (1996)], is
the hopping dynamics of a quantum particle on a one-dimensional tight-binding
lattice in the presence of an imaginary vectorial potential. The imaginary
gauge field can prevent Anderson localization via non-Hermitian delocalization,
opening up a mobility region and realizing robust transport immune to disorder
and backscattering. Like for robust transport of topologically-protected edge
states in quantum Hall and topological insulator systems, non-Hermitian robust
transport in the Hatano- Nelson model is unidirectional. However, there is not
any physical impediment to observe robust bidirectional non-Hermitian
transport. Here it is shown that in a quasi-one dimensional zigzag lattice,
with non-Hermitian (imaginary) hopping amplitudes and a synthetic gauge field,
robust transport immune to backscattering can occur bidirectionally along the

Boolean features in the last hidden layer of DBNs used for EDA-based

structure of the FCM is combined with the array configuration to resolve the
coherent signals. Since each sparse array of the coprime arrays is uniform, a

From the smoothed FCM, the DOAs of both the coherent and independent signals
can be successfully estimated on the pseudo-spectrum generated by the

appearing on the pseudo-spectrum, we use a supplementary sparse array whose

removed while the true peaks remain. The effectiveness of the proposed methods

$A_1$. This scenario has consequences for e.g. light singlino Dark Matter
annihilating in the $A_1$-funnel. In order to confront the pseudoscalar to
experimental limits such as flavour observables, Upsilon decays or Beam-Dump
experiments, it is necessary to control the interactions of this particle with
hadronic matter and derive the corresponding decays. The partonic description
cannot be relied upon for masses close to $m_{A_1}\sim1$GeV and we employ a
chiral lagrangian, then extended to a spectator model for somewhat larger

Interestingly, a mixing can develop between $A_1$ and neutral pseudoscalar
mesons, leading to substantial hadronic decays and a coupling of $A_1$ to the
chiral anomaly. Additionally, quartic $A_1$-meson couplings induce tri-meson
decays of the Higgs pseudoscalar. We investigate these effects and propose an

word problem was decidable but which did not admit a finite convergent
presentation. To do so, Squier constructed, for any convergent presentation
$(G,R)$ of a monoid $M$, a set of syzygies $S$ corresponding to relations
between the relations. This construction was later extended into the
construction of a polygraphic resolution $\Sigma$ of $M$, whose first
dimensions coincide with Squier's construction $(G,R,S)$.
  However, the construction of the polygraphic resolution has proved to be too
complicated to be effectively computed on non-trivial examples. Cubical
categories appear to be a promising framework where Squier's theorem and the
construction of the polygraphic resolution would be more straightforward.
  This paper is the first step towards this goal. We start by defining the

based on image food recognition, opened to new challenges for computer vision
and pattern recognition algorithms. Recent works in the field are focusing
either on hand-crafted representations or on learning these by exploiting deep
neural networks. Despite the success of such a last family of works, these
generally exploit off-the shelf deep architectures to classify food dishes.
Thus, the architectures are not cast to the specific problem. We believe that
better results can be obtained if the deep architecture is defined with respect
to an analysis of the food composition. Following such an intuition, this work
introduces a new deep scheme that is designed to handle the food structure.
Specifically, inspired by the recent success of residual deep network, we
exploit such a learning scheme and introduce a slice convolution block to
capture the vertical food layers. Outputs of the deep residual blocks are
combined with the sliced convolution to produce the classification score for
specific food categories. To evaluate our proposed architecture we have
conducted experimental results on three benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate
that our solution shows better performance with respect to existing approaches
(e.g., a top-1 accuracy of 90.27% on the Food-101 challenging dataset).

neutrino mixing matrix for active and sterile neutrinos are suggested taking
into account the possible violation of CP invariance in the lepton sector. The
test values of the neutrino masses and the mixing parameters are chosen. The
transition probabilities for the different flavors of neutrino, which can be
transformed into each other, are calculated, and the graphical dependences are
obtained for the disappearance probability of muon neutrino/antineutrino and
appearance probability of electron neutrino/antineutrino in the muon
neutrino/antineutrino jet as a function of distance and other model parameters
at their acceptable values and at neutrino energies not higher than 50 MeV, as
well as a function of the ratio of the distance to the neutrino energy. It is
shown that in the case of the mixing matrix of a definite type (of the a_2

anomaly on small distances in the neutrino data (LSND anomaly) is possible, as

be used for the interpretation and prediction of results of the ground-based

where obesity was shown to be associated to a decreased mortality in
individuals suffering from a chronic disease, such as diabetes or heart
failure. Causal arguments have recently been given to explain this apparently
paradoxical fact: because the chronic disease is caused by obesity, the
observed ""protective effect"" of obesity among patients with, say, diabetes,
actually has no causal value. Recently, Sperrin et al. (2016) relaunched the
debate and claimed that the resulting bias, the so-called collider bias, was
unlikely to be the main explanation for the obesity paradox. However, a number
of issues in their work make their conclusions questionable. In this article,
we first study the bias between (i) the association between obesity and early
death among patients suffering from the chronic disease $\Delta_{AS}$ and (ii)
the causal effect considered by Sperrin et al. Under the usual framework of
structural causal models, we explain why this bias can be much higher than what
these authors reported. We further consider alternative causal effects of
potential interest and study their difference with $\Delta_{AS}$. Numerical
examples are presented to illustrate the magnitude of these differences under
realistic scenarios. We show that it is possible to have a negative
$\Delta_{AS}$, while the causal effects we considered are all positive.
Therefore, even under the very simple generative model we considered, collider
bias can be the sole cause of the obesity paradox.

successful channel estimation builds upon the assumption that the channel can

a dictionary learning based channel model such that a dictionary is learned
from comprehensively collected channel measurements. The learned dictionary
adapts specifically to the cell characteristics and promotes a more efficient
and robust channel representation, which in turn improves the performance of
the channel estimation. Furthermore, we extend the dictionary learning based
channel model into a joint uplink/downlink learning framework by observing the
reciprocity of the AOA/AOD between the uplink/downlink transmission, and
propose a joint channel estimation algorithm that combines the uplink and
downlink received training signals to obtain a more accurate channel estimate.
In other words, the downlink training overhead, which is a bottleneck in FDD

uplink training.

classical Cassini state, in terms of parameters of Mercury's interior.
  We determine and solve analytically the angular momentum equation,
highlighting the respective roles of the pericenter precession and tidal
deformations on the spin precession behavior. We also show explicitly that
Peale's equation is sometimes wrongly cited in the literature, resulting in
wrong estimates of the polar moment of inertia, and review the importance of
many effects that change the determination of the polar moment of inertia from
obliquity measurements.
  From the observed orientation of Stark et al. (2015b), we estimate that
C/MR^2=0.3434+/-0.0102, which is ~0.9% smaller than the estimate by Stark et
al. (2015b) themselves. That difference is due to our refinements of the
Cassini state model (0.1%) and to their wrong use of Peale's equation (0.8%).
The difference is smaller than the actual precision (3-4%) on the polar moment
of inertia but may be of the order of precision that can be reached with
BepiColombo mission (<=0.3%).

  Perturbation Experiments","20 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.IT math.IT q-bio.MN stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconstructing the causal network in a complex dynamical system plays a
crucial role in many applications, from sub-cellular biology to economic
systems. Here we focus on inferring gene regulation networks (GRNs) from
perturbation or gene deletion experiments. Despite their scientific merit, such
perturbation experiments are not often used for such inference due to their
costly experimental procedure, requiring significant resources to complete the
measurement of every single experiment. To overcome this challenge, we develop
the Robust IDentification of Sparse networks (RIDS) method that reconstructs
the GRN from a small number of perturbation experiments. Our method uses the
gene expression data observed in each experiment and translates that into a
steady state condition of the system's nonlinear interaction dynamics. Applying
a sparse optimization criterion, we are able to extract the parameters of the
underlying weighted network, even from very few experiments. In fact, we
demonstrate analytically that, under certain conditions, the GRN can be
perfectly reconstructed using $K = \Omega (d_{max})$ perturbation experiments,
where $d_{max}$ is the maximum in-degree of the GRN, a small value for
realistic sparse networks, indicating that RIDS can achieve high performance
with a scalable number of experiments. We test our method on both synthetic and
experimental data extracted from the DREAM5 network inference challenge. We
show that the RIDS achieves superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, while requiring as few as ~60% less experimental
data. Moreover, as opposed to almost all competing methods, RIDS allows us to
infer the directionality of the GRN links, allowing us to infer empirical GRNs,
without relying on the commonly provided list of transcription factors.

be used to provide optimal treatment proportions for designs in more general

called Collinear Cluster Tri-partition (CCT), suggesting that three heavy
fission fragments can be emitted perfectly collinearly in low-energy fission.
It is surprising that CCT escaped observation for so long given the relatively
high reported yield, of roughly 0.5% relative to binary fission. These claims
call for an independent verification with a different experimental technique.
Verification experiments based on direct observation of CCT fragments with
fission fragment spectrometers require guidance with respect to the allowed
kinetic energy range, which we present in this paper. We discuss corresponding
model calculations which, if CCT is found in such verification experiments,
could indicate how the breakups proceed. We also study the intrinsic stability
of collinearity. Three different decay models are used, which span together the
timescales of three-body fission. These models are used to calculate the
possible kinetic energy ranges of CCT fragments in 235U(n,f) and 252Cf(sf). We
use semi-classical trajectory calculations with a Monte-Carlo method to study
the intrinsic stability of collinearity. CCT has a high net Q-value, but in a
sequential decay, the intermediate steps are energetically and geometrically
unfavorable or even forbidden. Moreover, perfect collinearity is extremely
unstable, and broken by the slightest perturbation. According to our results,
the central fragment would be very difficult to detect due to its low kinetic
energy, raising the question of why previous experiments could not detect a
missing-mass signature corresponding to CCT. We find that a realization of CCT
would require an unphysical fine-tuning of the initial conditions. Our results
enable independent experimental verification and encourage further critical
theoretical studies of CCT.

been widely employed to solve the gas kinetic equations. Although various
versions of DVM have been developed, their performance, in terms of accuracy
and computational efficiency, is yet to be compreheively studied in the whole
flow regime. Here, the traditional third-order time-implicit Godunov DVM (GDVM)
and the recently developed discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) are
analysed in finding steady-state solutions of the force-driven Poiseuille and
lid-driven cavity flows. With the molecular collision and free streaming being
treated simultaneously, the DUGKS preserves the second-order accuracy in the
spatial and temporal discretizations in all flow regimes. Towards the
hydrodynamic flow regime, the DUGKS is not only faster than the GDVM when using
the same spatial mesh, but also requires less spatial resolution than that of
the GDVM to achieve the same numerical accuracy. From the slip to free
molecular flow regimes, however, the DUGKS is slower than the GDVM, due to the
complicated flux evaluation and the time step is less than the maximum
effective time step of the GDVM. Therefore, the DUGKS is preferable for
problems involving different flow regimes, particularly when the hydrodynamic
flow regime is dominant. For highly rarefied gas flows, if the steady-state
solution is concerned, the implicit DVM, which can boost the convergence
significantly, is a better choice.

with the fracture surfaces represented as line pairs in 2D (faces in 3D) that
displace relative to each other. Fracture deformation is coupled to that of the
surrounding domain through internal boundary conditions. This approach is
natural within the finite-volume framework, where tractions are defined on
surfaces of the grid. The MPSA method is capable of modeling deformation
considering open and closed fractures with complex and nonlinear relationships
governing the displacements and tractions at the fracture surfaces. We validate
our proposed approach using both problems for which analytical solutions are
available and more complex benchmark problems, including comparison with a
finite-element discretization.

decentralization and aggregation, to guide both the constructing of individual
clustering results and the final combination for clustering ensemble. Firstly,
independency criterion, as a novel mapping system on the raw data set, removes
the correlation between features on our proposed method. Then, decentralization
as a novel mechanism generates high-quality individual clustering results.
Next, uniformity as a new diversity metric evaluates the generated clustering
results. Further, weighted evidence accumulation clustering method is proposed
for the final aggregation without using thresholding procedure. Experimental
study on varied data sets demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

field is studied within the spin wave theory to investigate the resulting

both for easy-axis and easy-plane scenarios which reveal an unentangled
factorized ground state at an intermediate value of the field. Goldstone modes
are obtained for the field-free $XY$ antiferromagnet as well as for the
isotropic antiferromagnet with field up to its saturation value. Moreover, for
an easy-plane anisotropy, we find that there exists a non-zero field, where
magnon degeneracy appears as a result of restoration of an U(1) sublattice
symmetry and that, across that field, there occurs a magnon band crossing. For
completeness, we then obtain the system phase diagram for $S=1/2$ via large
scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations using the stochastic series expansion
technique. Our numerical method is based on a quantization of spin along the
direction of the applied magnetic field and does not suffer from a
sign-problem, unlike comparable algorithms based on a spin quantization along
the axis of anisotropy. With this formalism, we are also able to obtain powder
averages of the transverse and longitudinal magnetizations, which may be useful
for understanding experimental measurements on polycrystalline samples.

superconductivity is enhanced as the dimensionless Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$

First, the density of states at $\epsilon_F$ increases as
$1/\sqrt{\epsilon_F}$. Second, the particle-hole bubble becomes more
anisotropic, resulting in an increasing effective attraction. The
superconducting state is always in the total angular momentum $j_z=+2$ (or

symmetry spontaneously. Although a putative Leggett mode is expected due to the

importantly, once a sufficiently large Zeeman coupling is applied to the
superconducting state, the Chern number can be tuned to be $\pm1$ and Majorana
zero modes exist in the vortex cores.

appearance features, such as HOG or Color Names. Recently, deep RGB features
extracted from convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied for
tracking. Despite their success, these features only capture appearance
information. On the other hand, motion cues provide discriminative and
complementary information that can improve tracking performance. Contrary to
visual tracking, deep motion features have been successfully applied for action
recognition and video classification tasks. Typically, the motion features are
learned by training a CNN on optical flow images extracted from large amounts
of labeled videos.
  This paper presents an investigation of the impact of deep motion features in
a tracking-by-detection framework. We further show that hand-crafted, deep RGB,
and deep motion features contain complementary information. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to propose fusing appearance information with deep
motion features for visual tracking. Comprehensive experiments clearly suggest
that our fusion approach with deep motion features outperforms standard methods

thus form the so-called Spite plateau. This was originally interpreted as
arising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent
observations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars;

of the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection
between the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A
straightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP
stars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we
have determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars
with metallicities $[{\rm Fe/H}]\sim -3.0$, where there are numerous
carbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered.
Our 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium
abundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests
that carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related.
Instead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental
cause to depleted lithium in UMP stars.

revisited with a simple model that highlights the importance of simultaneous
tunneling of electrons. Previously, cotunneling effects on the drag current in
mesoscopic setups have been reported both theoretically and experimentally.
However, in both cases the sequential tunneling contribution to the drag
current was always present unless the drag level position were too far away
from resonance. Here, we consider the case of very large Coulomb interaction
between the dots, whereby the drag current needs to be assisted by cotunneling
events. As a consequence, a quantum coherent drag effect takes place. Further,
we demonstrate that by properly engineering the tunneling probabilities using
band tailoring it is possible to control the sign of the drag and drive
currents, allowing them to flow in parallel or antiparallel directions. We also

to control and generate SPCs in stanene nanoribbons in the quantum spin Hall
(QSH) insulator regime by all electrical means without spin-flip mechanism.
This is achieved with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in stanene nanoribbons by
tuning the relative phase of spin up and down electrons using a gate voltage,
which creates a time delay between them thereby producing alternative SPCs
driven by ac voltage. The control and generation of SPCs are demonstrated
numerically for ac transport in both transient and ac regime. Our results are
robust against edge imperfections and generally valid for other QSH insulators
such as silicene and germanene, etc. These findings establish a novel route for
generating SPCs by purely electrical means and open the door for new
applications of semiconductor spintronics.

(2016) reported a near-infrared (NIR) excess for SN 2012dn, and proposed that
the excess originates from an echo by circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper,
we examine a detailed distribution of the CS dust around SN 2012dn, and
investigate implications of the CS dust echo scenario for general cases of
SC-SNe Ia. We find that a disk/bipolar CS medium configuration reproduces the
NIR excess fairly well, where the radial density distribution is given by a
stationary mass loss. The inner radius of the CS dust is $0.04$ pc. The
mass-loss rate of the progenitor system is estimated to be $1.2 \times 10^{-5}$
and $3.2 \times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the disk and bipolar CS
medium configurations, respectively, which adds another support for the single
degenerate scenario. Our models limit SN 2009dc, another SC-SN Ia, to have a
dust mass less than $0.16$ times that of SN 2012dn. While this may merely
indicate some variation on the CS environment among SC-SNe Ia, this could raise
another interesting possibility. There could be two classes among SC-SNe Ia;
the brighter SC-SNe Ia in a clean environment (SN 2009dc) and the fainter
SC-SNe Ia in a dusty environment (SN 2012dn).

Here, we extend the study of zealotry to the case of an adaptive network
topology co-evolving with the state of the nodes and investigate opinion
spreading induced by zealots depending on their initial density and
connectedness. Numerical simulations reveal that below the fragmentation
threshold a low density of zealots is sufficient to spread their opinion to the
whole network. Beyond the transition point, zealots must exhibit an increased
degree as compared to ordinary nodes for an efficient spreading of their
opinion. We verify the numerical findings using a mean-field approximation of
the model yielding a low-dimensional set of coupled ordinary differential
equations. Our results imply that the spreading of the zealot opinion in the
adaptive voter model is strongly dependent on the rate of link rewiring and the
average degree of normal nodes in comparison with that of the zealots. In order
to avoid a complete dominance of the zealots' opinion, there are two possible
strategies for the remaining nodes: adjusting the rate of rewiring and/or the
number of connections with other nodes, respectively.

transmissions, and outperforming the state-of-the-art one-dimensional (i.e.,
angle) phase array (PA) based DM scheme. Then we develop the closed-form
expression of a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) of our
RFDA-DM-AN scheme. Based on the theoretical lower bound derived, we further
optimize the transmission power allocation between the useful signal and
artificial noise (AN) in order to enhance the ESC. Simulation results show that
1) our RFDA-DM-AN scheme achieves a higher secrecy capacity than that of the PA
based DM scheme, 2) the lower bound derived is shown to approach the ESC as the
number of transmit antennas N increases and precisely matches the ESC when N is
sufficiently large, and 3) the proposed optimum power allocation achieves the
highest ESC compared with other power allocations in the RFDA-DM-AN.

become available for research. This data offers great chances for machine
learning applications in health care, e.g. for precision medicine, but is also
challenging to analyze. Typical challenges include a large number of possibly
correlated features and heterogeneity in the data. One flourishing field of
biological research in which this is relevant is epigenetics. Here, especially
large amounts of DNA methylation data have emerged. This epigenetic mark has
been used to predict a donor's 'epigenetic age' and increased epigenetic aging
has been linked to lifestyle and disease history. In this paper we propose an
adaptive model which performs feature selection for each test sample
individually based on the distribution of the input data. The method can be
seen as partially blind domain adaptation. We apply the model to the problem of
age prediction based on DNA methylation data from a variety of tissues, and
compare it to a standard model, which does not take heterogeneity into account.
The standard approach has particularly bad performance on one tissue type on
which we show substantial improvement with our new adaptive approach even
though no samples of that tissue were part of the training data.

allowed to access the shared spectrum for data transmissions, another source is
opportunistically selected in the spectrum sharing system to transmit an

We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions for the

analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. It is proved that the
conventional non-cooperation exhibits a secrecy diversity of zero, whereas the

surprisingly means that no additional secrecy diversity gain is achieved by the
optimal jammer selection compared to the random selection strategy. In
addition, numerical results show that the intercept probability performance of
the SC-OJS is always better than that of the SC-RJS and non-cooperation, even
when the legitimate channel is worse than the eavesdropping channel.

support the zip operator and are still an order of magnitude slower than

generality of stream processing and eliminates overheads, via the use of
staging. It is based on an unusually rich semantic model of stream interaction.
We support any combination of zipping, nesting (or flat-mapping), sub-ranging,
filtering, mapping-of finite or infinite streams. Our model captures
idiosyncrasies that a programmer uses in optimizing stream pipelines, such as
rate differences and the choice of a ""for"" vs. ""while"" loops. Our approach
delivers hand-written-like code, but automatically. It explicitly avoids the
reliance on black-box optimizers and sufficiently-smart compilers, offering
highest, guaranteed and portable performance. Our approach relies on high-level
concepts that are then readily mapped into an implementation. Accordingly, we
have two distinct implementations: an OCaml stream library, staged via
MetaOCaml, and a Scala library for the JVM, staged via LMS. In both cases, we
derive libraries richer and simultaneously many tens of times faster than past

challenged by observability issues. On the other hand, smart meter data,
including local voltage magnitudes and power injections, are communicated to
the utility operator from grid buses with renewable generation and
demand-response programs. This work employs grid data from metered buses
towards inferring the underlying grid state. To this end, a coupled formulation
of the power flow problem (CPF) is put forth. Exploiting the high variability
of injections at metered buses, the controllability of solar inverters, and the
relative time-invariance of conventional loads, the idea is to solve the
non-linear power flow equations jointly over consecutive time instants. An
intuitive and easily verifiable rule pertaining to the locations of metered and
non-metered buses on the physical grid is shown to be a necessary and
sufficient criterion for local observability in radial networks. To account for
noisy smart meter readings, a coupled power system state estimation (CPSSE)
problem is further developed. Both CPF and CPSSE tasks are tackled via
augmented semi-definite program relaxations. The observability criterion along
with the CPF and CPSSE solvers are numerically corroborated using synthetic and
actual solar generation and load data on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark feeder.

viewed as a probability space whose outcomes (referred to as \emph{possible
worlds}) are subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}$ where any edge $e\in E$ occurs with
probability $p(e)$, independently of the other edges. These graphs naturally
arise in many application domains where data management systems are required to
cope with uncertainty in interrelated data, such as computational biology,
social network analysis, network reliability, and privacy enforcement, among
the others. For this reason, it is important to devise fundamental querying and
mining primitives for uncertain graphs. This paper contributes to this endeavor
with the development of novel strategies for clustering uncertain graphs.
Specifically, given an uncertain graph $\mathcal{G}$ and an integer $k$, we aim
at partitioning its nodes into $k$ clusters, each featuring a distinguished
center node, so to maximize the minimum/average connection probability of any
node to its cluster's center, in a random possible world. We assess the
NP-hardness of maximizing the minimum connection probability, even in the
presence of an oracle for the connection probabilities, and develop efficient
approximation algorithms for both problems and some useful variants. Unlike
previous works in the literature, our algorithms feature provable approximation
guarantees and are capable to keep the granularity of the returned clustering
under control. Our theoretical findings are complemented with several
experiments that compare our algorithms against some relevant competitors, with
respect to both running-time and quality of the returned clusterings.

the generic presence of singularities in classical gravity, which limits the
applicability of AdS/CFT to regimes where the singularities are avoided by bulk
probes, or some other form of regularisation is applicable. At the same time,
quantum gravity is expected to resolve those singularities and thus to extend
the range of applicability of AdS/CFT also in classically singular regimes.
This paper exemplifies such a computation. We use an effective quantum

quantum gravity to compute the 2-point correlator in the geodesic approximation

a signature of the singularity. Using the quantum corrected metric, we show
explicitly how the pole is resolved and that a new subdominant long-distance
contribution to the correlator emerges, caused by geodesics passing arbitrarily
close to the resolved classical singularity. In order to compute analytically
in this paper, two key simplifications in the quantum corrected metric are
necessary. They are lifted in a companion paper using numerical techniques,

small-scale structure problems, such as the observed flat cores in dwarf and
low surface brightness galaxies. If scattering takes place through light
mediators, the scattering cross section relevant to solve these problems may
fall into the non-perturbative regime leading to a non-trivial velocity
dependence, which allows compatibility with limits stemming from cluster-size
objects. However, these models are strongly constrained by different
observations, in particular from the requirements that the decay of the light
mediator is sufficiently rapid (before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) and from
direct detection. A natural solution to reconcile both requirements are
inelastic endothermic interactions, such that scatterings in direct detection
experiments are suppressed or even kinematically forbidden if the mass
splitting between the two-states is sufficiently large. Using an exact solution
when numerically solving the Schr\""odinger equation, we study such scenarios

the mass splitting of the states, where the small scale structure problems can
be solved, the dark matter has the correct relic abundance and direct detection

start by surveying several results in this direction, with an emphasis on the
numerical algorithms that are available for the construction of the
approximation, in particular through interpolation or discrete least-squares
fitting. All such algorithms rely on the assumption that the set of
multi-indices associated with the polynomial space is downward closed. In the
present paper we introduce some tools for the study of approximation in
multivariate spaces under this assumption, and use them in the derivation of
error bounds, sometimes independent of the dimension d, and in the development
of adaptive strategies.

concentrated to a small cluster around the impurity. For this small effective

an implicit approximation of the reduced density-matrix functional. The method
is evaluated for single-impurity Anderson models with finite baths. The method

give sets that are \emph{not} projections of mixed-integer linear sets; so the

obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real
world. In many real-world tasks, designing a reward function takes considerable
hand engineering and often requires additional sensors to be installed just to
measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many
interesting tasks consist of multiple implicit intermediate steps that must be
executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not
necessarily provide feedback on these intermediate steps. To address these
issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual
representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward
functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is
able to identify key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of
demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative
features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in
a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit specification of
sub-goals. The resulting reward functions can then be used by an RL agent to
learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned
reward, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a
quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also show
that our method can be used to learn a real-world door opening skill using a
real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by
a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results
showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and
without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

has applications in various fields. Previous works in this area have either
used images from a 2D or 3D camera. Few have used the idea that human actions

instead used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for modeling. Convolutional
neural networks (CNN) have the ability to recognise even the complex patterns
in data which makes it suitable for detecting human actions. Thus, we modeled a
CNN which can predict the human activity using the joint data. Furthermore,
using the joint data representation has the benefit of lower dimensionality
than image or video representations. This makes our model simpler and faster
than the RNN models. In this study, we have developed a six layer convolutional
network, which reduces each input feature vector of the form 15x1961x4 to an
one dimensional binary vector which gives us the predicted activity. Results:
Our model is able to recognise an activity correctly upto 87% accuracy. Joint
data is taken from the Cornell Activity Datasets which have day to day

""bottom-up"" approach using ""passive"" scoring of class agnostic proposals. These
approaches are efficient but lack of holistic analysis of scene-level context.
In this paper, we present an ""action-driven"" detection mechanism using our
""top-down"" visual attention model. We localize an object by taking sequential
actions that the attention model provides. The attention model conditioned with
an image region provides required actions to get closer toward a target object.
An action at each time step is weak itself but an ensemble of the sequential
actions makes a bounding-box accurately converge to a target object boundary.
This attention model we call AttentionNet is composed of a convolutional neural
network. During our whole detection procedure, we only utilize the actions from
a single AttentionNet without any modules for object proposals nor post
bounding-box regression. We evaluate our top-down detection mechanism over the
PASCAL VOC series and ILSVRC CLS-LOC dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art
performances compared to the major bottom-up detection methods. In particular,
our detection mechanism shows a strong advantage in elaborate localization by
outperforming Faster R-CNN with a margin of +7.1% over PASCAL VOC 2007 when we
increase the IoU threshold for positive detection to 0.7.

gating grid of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This system connects the wires
of the gating grid to its driver via low impedance transmission lines. When the
gating grid is open, all wires have the same voltage allowing drift electrons,
produced by the ionization of the detector gas molecules, to pass through to
the anode wires. When the grid is closed, the wires have alternating higher and
lower voltages causing the drift electrons to terminate at the more positive
wires. Rapid opening of the gating grid with low pickup noise is achieved by
quickly shorting the positive and negative wires to attain the average bias
potential with N-type and P-type MOSFET switches. The circuit analysis and
simulation software SPICE shows that the driver restores the gating grid
voltage to 90% of the opening voltage in less than 0.20 $\mu$s. When tested in
the experimental environment of a time projection chamber larger termination
resistors were chosen so that the driver opens the gating grid in 0.35 $\mu$s.
In each case, opening time is basically characterized by the RC constant given
by the resistance of the switches and terminating resistors and the capacitance
of the gating grid and its transmission line. By adding a second pair of N-type
and P-type MOSFET switches, the gating grid is closed by restoring 99% of the
original charges to the wires within 3 $\mu$s.

While various studies have investigated the mechanical aspect of the
interaction such as acoustic absorption and membrane deformation, it is not
clear how these effects transduce into biological functions, for example,
changes in the permeability or the enzymatic activity of the membrane. A
critical aspect of the activity of an enzyme is the thermal fluctuations of its
solvation or hydration shell. Thermal fluctuations are also known to be
directly related to membrane permeability. Here solvation shell changes of
lipid membranes subject to an acoustic impulse were investigated using a
fluorescence probe, Laurdan. Laurdan was embedded in multi-lamellar lipid
vesicles in water, which were exposed to broadband pressure impulses of the
order of 1MPa peak amplitude and 10{\mu}s pulse duration. An instrument was
developed to monitor changes in the emission spectrum of the dye at two
wavelengths with sub-microsecond temporal resolution. The experiments show that
changes in the emission spectrum, and hence the fluctuations of the solvation
shell, are related to the changes in the thermodynamic state of the membrane
and correlated with the compression and rarefaction of the incident sound wave.
The results suggest that acoustic fields affect the state of a lipid membrane
and therefore can potentially modulate the kinetics of channels and proteins
embedded in the membrane.

second-overtone, strongly modulated Cepheid, while U Trianguli Australis is a
Cepheid pulsating simultaneously in the fundamental mode and first overtone.
The nearly continuous, high-precision photometry reveals alternations in the
amplitudes of cycles in V473 Lyr, the first case of period doubling detected in
a classical Cepheid. In U TrA, we tentatively identify one peak as the $f_X$ or
0.61-type mode often seen in conjunction with the first radial overtone in
Cepheids, but given the short length of the data, we cannot rule out that it is
a combination peak instead.
  Ground-based photometry and spectroscopy were obtained to follow two
modulation cycles in V473 Lyr and to better specify its physical parameters.
The simultaneous data yield the phase lag parameter (the phase difference
between maxima in luminosity and radial velocity) of a second-overtone Cepheid
for the first time. We find no evidence for a period change in U TrA or an
energy exchange between the fundamental mode and the first overtone during the
last 50 years, contrary to earlier indications.
  Period doubling in V473 Lyr provides a strong argument that mode interactions
do occur in some Cepheids and we may hypothesise that it could be behind the
amplitude modulation, as recently proposed for Blazhko RR Lyrae stars.

rotational velocity curves of particle moving around the galactic center and
the expected rotational velocity curves do not match. There are also a number
of proposals in the modified gravity for this discrepancy. In this contrast, in
$2008$, B$\ddot{\text{o}}$hmer et al. presented an interesting idea in
(Astropart Phys 29(6):386-392, 2008) where they showed that a $f(\mathcal{R})$
gravity model could actually explain dark matter to be a geometric effect only.
They solved the gravitational field equations in vacuum using generic
$f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity model for constant velocity regions and found that the
resulting modifications in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is of the form
$\mathcal{R}^{1+m}$, where $m=V_{tg}^2/c^2$; $V_{tg}$ being the tangential
velocity of the test particle moving around galactic dark matter region and,
$c$, the speed of light. From observations it is known that
$m\approx\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$. In this article, we perform two things (1) We
show that the form of $f(\mathcal{R})$ they claimed is not correct. In doing
the calculations, we found that when the radial component of the metric for
constant velocity regions is a constant then the exact solutions for
$f(\mathcal{R})$ obtained is of the form of $\mathcal{R}^{1-\alpha}$ which
corresponds to a negative correction rather than positive, $\alpha$ is a
function of $m$. (2) We also show that we can not have an analytic solution of
$f(\mathcal{R})$ for all values of tangential velocity including the observed
value of tangential velocity $200-300$Km/s if the radial coefficient of the
metric which describes the dark matter regions is \emph{not a constant}. Thus,
we have to rely on the numerical solutions to get an approximate model for dark
matter in $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.

equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD). While the FHD formulation is
formally described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), it
becomes similar to the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) description
when those SPDEs are spatially discretized and reactions are modeled as a
source term having Poisson fluctuations. However, unlike the RDME, the FHD
description naturally extends from the regime where fluctuations are strong,
i.e., each hydrodynamic cell has few (reactive) molecules, to regimes with
moderate or weak fluctuations, and ultimately to the deterministic limit. By
treating diffusion implicitly, we avoid the severe restriction on time step
size that limits all methods based on explicit treatments of diffusion, and
construct numerical methods that are more efficient than RDME methods, without
compromising accuracy. We find that an implicit midpoint tau leaping scheme
attains second-order weak accuracy for the linearized FHD, and gives an
accurate and stable structure factor for a time step size an order of magnitude
larger than the hopping time scale of diffusing molecules. We study the
numerical accuracy of our methods for the Schl\""ogl reaction-diffusion model
both in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium. We demonstrate and quantify the
importance of thermodynamic fluctuations to the formation of a two-dimensional
Turing-like pattern, and examine the effect of fluctuations on
three-dimensional chemical front propagation. By comparing FHD simulations to
deterministic reaction-diffusion simulations, we show that fluctuations
accelerate pattern formation in spatially homogeneous systems, and lead to a
qualitatively-different disordered pattern behind a traveling wave.

  This book has contributions from the conference on the 'Star of Bethlehem',
  held in Groningen in October 2014",,,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previously, the most prominent explanation for the Star of Bethlehem was to
identify one of many astronomical events in the sky as being the inspiration
for the trip of the Magi. However, all the astronomical answers have detailed
refutations, and general disproofs, so all the astronomical answers for the
Star are dead.
  In 1999, Michael Molnar put forth a completely new solution, where the Star
originated as a report of a natal horoscope for 17 April 6 BC. This natal
horoscope shows very impressive regal portents and points to Judea. It is very
improbable that such a very rare planet configuration (averaging only once per
millennium or longer) would coincide with the very restricted day of Jesus'
birth (springtime in a year shortly before Herod's death in 4 BC), unless there
is some causal connection. The Magi (as labeled by the gospel author) were
astrologers, so they were only interested in horoscopes. The astrological
solution is further supported by the presence of an astrological technical term
('in the east' meaning what astronomers call the 'heliacal rise') in the
Nativity narrative of Matthew. Importantly, Molnar has only identified the Star
as originating from a particular natal horoscope, while making no statement
about the nature or historicity of any of the other elements of the story in
Matthew. So for example, the Magi might be astrologers as idealized by the
Greeks of the time, or they might have been non-existent (invented by a
latter-day Greek seeking omens for the birth of a great king), and they might
have arrived on 17 April 6 BC or months later, and they might or might not have
been three in numbers with given names. But for the Star of Bethlehem alone,
Molnar's astrological solution is convincing.

fields, which are measures whose values are positive semidefinite (PSD)

version of the classical Kantorovich transport problem, where the fidelity
between the input PSD-valued measures is captured using the geometry of the
Von-Neumann quantum entropy. We propose a quantum-entropic regularization of
the resulting convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently
using an iterative scaling algorithm. This method is a generalization of the
celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm to the quantum setting of PSD matrices. We extend
this formulation and the quantum Sinkhorn algorithm to compute barycenters
within a collection of input tensor fields. We illustrate the usefulness of the

interpreted by means of a conjectured deSitter $dS_4$ geometry of the internal
space-time of hadrons, an assumption inspired by the hypothesis on deSitter
special relativity. Within such a scenario, the interactions involving the
virtual gluon and constituent quark degrees of freedom of hadrons are deduced
from the Green functions of Laplace operators on the $dS_4$ geodesics. Then the
conformal symmetry of QCD emerges as a direct consequence of the conformal
symmetry of the $dS_4$ space-time, while the color confinement, understood as
colorlessness of hadrons, appears as a consequence of the inevitable charge
neutrality of the unique closed space-like manifold, the three dimensional
hyper-sphere $S^3$, on whose geodesics the hadron's constituents are
conjectured to reside when near rest frame.
  Mesons are now modelled as quarkish color-anticolor dipoles, whose free
quantum motions on the aforementioned $S^3$ geodesic are perturbed by a
potential generated by a gluon--anti-gluon color dipole. The potential
predicted presents itself as the color charge analogue to the ""curved"" Coulomb
potential, i.e. to the electric potential that defines a consistent
electrostatic theory on a hyper-spherical surface. The advantage of this method
is that it allows to establish a direct relationship of the potential
parameters to the fundamental constants of QCD. We apply the model to the
description of the spectra of the $a_1$ and $f_1$ mesons, and the pion electric
charge form factor, finding fair agreement with data.

Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{3}$. In section 2 we investigate some new formulae
concerning the Pick invariant, the relative curvature, the relative mean
curvature and the curvature of the relative metric of a relatively normalized
ruled surface $\varPhi$ and in section 3 we introduce some special
normalizations of it. All ruled surfaces and their corresponding normalizations
that make $\varPhi$ an improper or a proper relative sphere are determined in
section 4. In the last section we study ruled surfaces, which are
\emph{centrally} normalized, i.e., their relative normals at each point lie on
the corresponding central plane. Especially we study various properties of the
Tchebychev vector field. We conclude the paper by the study of the central
image of $\varPhi$.

multiple-output (MIMO) testbed by investigating hardware (HW) and system-level
requirements such as processing complexity, duplexing mode and frame structure.
Taking these into account, a generic system and processing partitioning is
proposed which allows flexible scaling and processing distribution onto a
multitude of physically separated devices. Based on the given HW constraints
such as maximum number of links and maximum throughput for peer-to-peer
interconnections combined with processing capabilities, the framework allows to
evaluate modular HW components. To verify our design approach, we present the
LuMaMi (Lund University Massive MIMO) testbed which constitutes the first
reconfigurable real-time HW platform for prototyping massive MIMO. Utilizing up
to 100 base station antennas and more than 50 Field Programmable Gate Arrays,
up to 12 user equipments are served on the same time/frequency resource using
an LTE-like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing time-division
duplex-based transmission scheme. Proof-of-concept tests with this system show
that massive MIMO can simultaneously serve a multitude of users in a static
indoor and static outdoor environment utilizing the same time/frequency
resource.
