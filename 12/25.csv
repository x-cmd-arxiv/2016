well between several tasks would be preferable. We propose a modular approach

Using signals from the human-inspired biotac sensor, we can predict future slip

languages: they allow program functionality to be decomposed into independent
blocks, and allow seamless extension of existing code with both new cases of
existing data types and new operations over those data types.
  This paper considers three approaches to providing extensible variants in
Haskell. Row typing is a long understood mechanism for typing extensible
records and variants, but its adoption would require extension of Haskell's
core type system. Alternatively, we might hope to encode extensible variants in
terms of existing mechanisms, such as type classes. We describe an encoding of
extensible variants using instance chains, a proposed extension of the class
system. Unlike many previous encodings of extensible variants, ours does not
require the definition of a new type class for each function that consumes
variants. Finally, we translate our encoding to use closed type families, an
existing feature of GHC. Doing so demonstrates the interpretation of instances
chains and functional dependencies in closed type families.
  One concern with encodings like ours is how completely they match the encoded
system. We compare the expressiveness of our encodings with each other and with
systems based on row types. We find that, while equivalent terms are typable in
each system, both encodings require explicit type annotations to resolve
ambiguities in typing not present in row type systems, and the type family
implementation retains more constraints in principal types than does the
instance chain implementation. We propose a general mechanism to guide the
instantiation of ambiguous type variables, show that it eliminates the need for
type annotations in our encodings, and discuss conditions under which it
preserves coherence.

placement for people, which is traditionally studied on politicians according
to their voting behaviors. Recently, more and more studies begin to address the
ideology detection problem for ordinary users based on their online behaviors
that can be captured by social media, e.g., Twitter. As far as we are
concerned, however, the vast majority of the existing methods on ideology
detection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binary
classification problem (i.e., liberal vs. conservative). Moreover, though
social links can play a critical role in deciding one's ideology, most of the
existing work ignores the heterogeneous types of links in social media. In this
paper we propose to detect \emph{numerical} ideology positions for Twitter
users, according to their \emph{follow}, \emph{mention}, and \emph{retweet}
links to a selected set of politicians. A unified probabilistic model is
proposed that can (1) explain the reasons why links are built among people in
terms of their ideology, (2) integrate heterogeneous types of links together in
determining people's ideology, and (3) automatically learn the quality of each
type of links in deciding one's ideology. Experiments have demonstrated the
advantages of our model in terms of both ranking and political leaning
classification accuracy. It is shown that (1) using multiple types of links is
better than using any single type of links alone to determine one's ideology,
and (2) our model is even more superior than baselines when dealing with people
that are sparsely linked in one type of links. We also show that the detected
ideology for Twitter users aligns with our intuition quite well.

excitations underlying capillary waves or ""ripplons"" for arbitrary strength
$K\,(>1)$ of the phase segregation. The dispersion relation $\omega \propto

that the wavelength $2\pi/k$ is much larger than the healing length $\xi $. The
proportionality constant in the dispersion relation provides the static

radar and radio-frequency communication systems, and commonly rely on
magnetically biased ferrite materials. Such devices are also indispensable in
the readout chains of superconducting quantum circuits as they protect
sensitive quantum systems from the noise emitted by readout electronics. Since
ferrite-based nonreciprocal devices are bulky, lossy, and require large
magnetic fields, there has been significant interest in magnetic-field-free
on-chip alternatives, such as those recently implemented using Josephson
junctions. Here we realise reconfigurable nonreciprocal transmission between
two microwave modes using purely optomechanical interactions in a
superconducting electromechanical circuit. We analyse the transmission as well
as the noise properties of this nonreciprocal circuit. The scheme relies on the
interference in two mechanical modes that mediate coupling between microwave
cavities. Finally, we show how quantum-limited circulators can be realized with
the same principle. The technology can be built on-chip without any external
magnetic field, and is hence fully compatible with superconducting quantum
circuits. All-optomechanically-mediated nonreciprocity demonstrated here can
also be extended to implement directional amplifiers, and it forms the basis
towards realising topological states of light and sound.

contributions are not evenly spaced in time. Sixty years of studies on career
productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal
pattern: productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually
declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by
analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series,
constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for
2453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 Ph.D-granting computer science departments

faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we
combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career
transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional
narrative confidently describes only one fifth of faculty, regardless of
department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four fifths of
faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this
diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories, and
explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing
that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the
timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results
demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time, and open the door
for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape
scientific productivity.

Fredholm characteristic is a special value of the Bowen-Lanford zeta function
and has various combinatorial interpretations. The unimodularity theorem proven
here shows that it is a cousin of the Euler characteristic as the later is the
sum of the w(x). Unimodularity implies that the matrix 1+A has an inverse which

segmentation from abdominal CT scans. However, the segmentation accuracy of
some small organs (e.g., the pancreas) is sometimes below satisfaction,
arguably because deep networks are easily disrupted by the complex and variable
background regions which occupies a large fraction of the input volume. In this
paper, we formulate this problem into a fixed-point model which uses a
predicted segmentation mask to shrink the input region. This is motivated by
the fact that a smaller input region often leads to more accurate segmentation.
In the training process, we use the ground-truth annotation to generate
accurate input regions and optimize network weights. On the testing stage, we
fix the network parameters and update the segmentation results in an iterative
manner. We evaluate our approach on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset, and
outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 4%, measured by the average
Dice-S{\o}rensen Coefficient (DSC). In addition, we report 62.43% DSC in the
worst case, which guarantees the reliability of our approach in clinical

compare the two notions of minimizer (i.e. local and global), showing that in

this is not true in unbounded open sets, where a global $s$-minimal set may
fail to exist (we provide an example in the case of a cylinder

  circuits","9 pages",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High energy particles from cosmic rays or packaging materials can generate a
glitch or a current transient (single event transient or SET) in a logic
circuit. This SET can eventually get captured in a register resulting in a flip
of the register content, which is known as soft error or single-event upset
(SEU). A soft error is typically modeled as a probabilistic single bit-flip
model. In developing such abstract fault models, an important issue to consider
is the likelihood of multiple bit errors caused by particle strikes. The fact
that an SET causes multiple flips is noted in the literature. We perform a
characterization study of the impact of an SET on a logic circuit to quantify
the extent to which an SET can cause multiple bit flips. We use post-layout
circuit simulations and Monte Carlo sampling scheme to get accurate bit-flip
statistics. We perform our simulations on ISCAS'85, ISCAS'89 and ITC'99
benchmarks in 180nm and 65nm technologies. We find that a substantial fraction
of SEU outcomes had multiple register flips. We futher analyse the individual
contributions of the strike on a register and the strike on a logic gate, to
multiple flips. We find that, amongst the erroneous outcomes, the probability
of multiple bit-flips for 'gate-strike' cases was substantial and went up to
50%, where as those for 'register-strike' cases was just about 2%. This implies
that, in principle, we can eliminate the flips due to register strikes using
hardened flip-flop designs. However, in such designs, out of the remaining
flips which will be due to gate strikes, a large fraction is likely to be
multiple flips.

methods accessing these scales not only have to be effective but also well
compatible to provide a full description of the underlying processes. We
propose to adapt the Generalized Shadow Hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method to
atomistic simulation of ion intercalation electrode materials for batteries.
The method has never been applied to simulations in solid state chemistry but
it has been successfully used for simulation of biological macromolecules,
demonstrating better performance and accuracy than can be achieved with the
popular molecular dynamics (MD) method. It has been also extended to
simulations on meso-scales, making it even more attractive for simulation of
battery materials. We combine GSHMC with the dynamical Core-Shell model to
incorporate polarizability into the simulation and apply the new Modified
Adaptive Integration Approach, MAIA, which allows for a larger time step due to
its excellent conservation properties. Also, we modify the GSHMC method,
without losing its performance and accuracy, to reduce the negative effect of
introducing a shell mass within a dynamical shell model. The proposed approach
has been tested on olivine NaFePO4, which is a promising cathode material for
Na-ion batteries. The calculated Na-ion diffusion and structural properties
have been compared with the available experimental data and with the results
obtained using MD and the original GSHMC method. Based on these tests, we claim
that the new technique is advantageous over MD and the conventional GSHMC and
can be recommended for studies of other solid-state electrode and electrolyte
materials whenever high accuracy and efficient sampling are critical for
obtaining tractable simulation results.

work we modify the liquid crystal stochastic rotational model (LC SRD) [Lee et

considerably reduce the computation and communication overhead of decentralized
recursive least-squares (D-RLS) solvers. The first relies on alternating
minimization and the stochastic Newton iteration to minimize a network-wide
cost, which discards observations with small innovations. In the resultant
algorithm, each node performs local data-adaptive censoring to reduce
computations, while exchanging its local estimate with neighbors so as to
consent on a network-wide solution. The communication cost is further reduced
by the second strategy, which prevents a node from transmitting its local
estimate to neighbors when the innovation it induces to incoming data is
minimal. In the third strategy, not only transmitting, but also receiving
estimates from neighbors is prohibited when data-adaptive censoring is in
effect. For all strategies, a simple criterion is provided for selecting the
threshold of innovation to reach a prescribed average data reduction. The novel
censoring-based (C)D-RLS algorithms are proved convergent to the optimal
argument in the mean-square deviation sense. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing computation and
communication overhead.

enhancement of the performance of quantum annealing in a mean-field
Hamiltonian. First-order quantum phase transitions were shown to be reduced to
second order by antiferromagnetic transverse interactions in a mean-field-type
many-body-interacting Ising spin system in a transverse field, which means an
exponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic quantum computation. We
investigate if and how quantum effects manifest themselves around these first-
and second-order phase transitions to understand if the antiferromagnetic
transverse interactions appended to the conventional transverse-field Ising
model induce notable quantum effects. By measuring the proximity of the
semiclassical spin-coherent state to the true ground state as well as the
magnitude of the concurrence representing entanglement, we conclude that
significant quantum fluctuations exist around second-order transitions, whereas
quantum effects are much less prominent at first-order transitions. Although
the location of the transition point can be predicted by the classical picture,
system properties near the transition need quantum-mechanical descriptions for
a second-order transition but not necessarily for first order. It is also found
that quantum fluctuations are large within the ferromagnetic phase after a
second-order transition from the paramagnetic phase. These results suggest that
the antiferromagnetic transverse interactions induce marked quantum effects,
and this fact would be related to closely to the significant enhancement of the
performance of quantum annealing.

central research topics for condensed matter physics and material science, the
interest driven both by fundamental science and applications. However,
ferroelectric surfaces, the key component of ferroelectric films and
nanostructures, still present a significant theoretical and even conceptual
challenge. Indeed, stability of ferroelectric phase per se necessitates
screening of polarization charge. At surfaces, this can lead to coupling
between ferroelectric and semiconducting properties of material, or with
surface (electro) chemistry, going well beyond classical models applicable for
ferroelectric interfaces. In this review, we summarize recent studies of
surface screening phenomena in ferroelectrics. We provide a brief overview of
the historical understanding of physics of ferroelectric surfaces, and existing
theoretical models that both introduce screening mechanisms and explore the
relationship between screening and relevant aspects of ferroelectric
functionalities starting from phase stability itself. Given that majority of
ferroelectrics exist in multiple-domain states, we focus on local studies of
screening phenomena using scanning probe microscopy techniques. We discuss
recent studies of static and dynamic phenomena on ferroelectric surfaces, as
well as phenomena observed under lateral transport, light, chemical, and
pressure stimuli. We also note that the need for ionic screening renders
polarization switching a coupled physical-electrochemical process, and discuss
the non-trivial phenomena such as chaotic behavior during domain switching that
stem from this.

intercalation desalination (CID) cells, which use intercalation host compounds
(IHCs) in combination with ion-exchange membranes (IEMs), could aid in
addressing this challenge by treating saline water sources. Originally, the
performance of such cells was predicted utilizing continuous flow of saline
water through porous IHC electrodes. Here, we use two-dimensional
porous-electrode theory with concentrated solution transport to evaluate the
performance of various cell architectures where flow occurs through open flow
channels (OFCs) when two IHC electrodes comprised of nickel hexacyanoferrate
(NiHCF) are used to store Na+ ions. We show that, when two OFCs are used,
cation exchange membranes (CEMs) are adjoined at flow-channel/electrode
interfaces, and an anion exchange membrane (AEM) is arranged between flow
channels, salt removal increases relative to the original design with
flow-through (FT) electrodes. The IEM stacking sequence within such a membrane
flow-by (MFB) cell is the fundamental repeat unit for electrodialysis (ED)
stacks using many IEMs (CEM/AEM/.../CEM/AEM/CEM) with many diluate streams.
Accordingly, we simulate the performance of such ED stacks using NiHCF IHCs,
and we predict that salt adsorption capacity (per unit NiHCF mass) is amplified
by twenty-fold relative to MFB and FT cells, while simultaneously decreasing
0.7 M NaCl feed water to 0.2-0.3 M within diluate streams. The generality of
these findings is further supported by simulations using Na0.44MnO2 IHC instead
of NiHCF. Thus, we propose the use of cation IHCs as alternatives to the
gas-evolution reactions used in conventional ED.

for a given momentum fraction $x_P$ carried by the diffractive exchange,
nuclear shadowing and antishadowing should compensate each other in the
momentum sum rule for nPDFs locally on the interval $\ln (x/x_P) \le 1$. We
realize this by constructing an explicit model of nuclear gluon antishadowing,

field theory and describe my work in three EFTs: First, in the perturbative QCD
region, I use soft collinear effective theory (SCET) to prove that strong
interaction soft radiation is universal and to increase the QCD accuracy to
next-to-next-tonext- to leading logarithm order for new particle searches in
hadron colliders. I also compute a new class of non-perturbative, large
logarithmic enhancement arising near the elastic limits of deep inelastic
scattering and Drell-Yan processes. Second, in the QCD confinement region, I
use heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory to study near-threshold
enhancements in the scattering of $D$ and $\pi$ mesons near the threshold for
the excited $D$-meson state, $D^*$, as well as in the scattering of $D$ and
$D^*$ mesons near the threshold for the exotic hadron X(3872). This work
provides a clear picture of the hadronic molecule X(3872) and more profound
understanding of the nuclear force between hadrons. Finally, inspired by SCET,
I construct a new electron-laser effective field theory to describe
highly-relativistic electrons traveling in strong laser fields, extract the
universal distribution of electrons in strong electromagnetic backgrounds and
its evolution in energy from the separated momentum scales of emitted photons
and classical radiation, and predict the rate of wide angle photon emission. I
conclude with limitations of EFT methods and some perspectives on what new work
may be achieved with these EFTs.

momentum($\vec{p}$) and energy($E$) eigenvalues is presented here. A set of
equations, explicitly independent on wave function, was derived relating these
observables. In this view, a particle has a known trajectory and at any point
on space there is a linear momentum associated. Trajectory here, can be viewed
as if a measurement were taken continuously. This picture does not change
current quantum mechanics interpretation, rather it comes as a new route of
calculation. Also, wave function can be retrieved performing an integration in
all space for linear momentum. Equations derived in this work, present a
potential dependent on linear momentum originating what we call quantum force.
A particle experiences a total force whose resultant is composed by classic and
quantum force, evolving on time according to it. In terms of evaluation, a
single particle could be described by a set of auxiliary particles named as
wave particles(WP). They will start with a range of initial conditions and will
collectively describe probabilistic aspects of quantum mechanics. We expect
this route could be applied to many problems, such as multi-body systems.

set of parameters. Some of these parameters are associated with black hole
physical conserved charges, like ADM charges. There can also be some ""redundant
parameters."" We propose necessary conditions for a parameter to be physical.
The conditions are essentially integrability and non-triviality of the charge
variations arising from ""parametric variations,"" variation of the solution with
respect to the chosen parameters. In addition, we prove that variation of the
redundant parameters which do not meet our criteria do not appear in the first
law of thermodynamics. As an interesting application, we show that dilaton
moduli are redundant parameters for black hole solutions to
Einstein-Maxwell-(Axion)-Dilaton theories, because variations in dilaton moduli
would render entropy, mass, electric charges or angular momenta non-integrable.
Our results are in contrast with modification of the first law due to scalar
charges suggested in Gibbons-Kallosh-Kol paper arXiv:hep-th/9607108 and its
follow-ups. We also briefly discuss implications of our results for the
attractor behavior of extremal black holes.

most reliable and sensitive indicators of the onset of material damage.
However, these effects are usually very small and can be detected only using
cumbersome digital signal processing techniques. Here, we propose and
experimentally validate an alternative approach, using the filtering and
focusing properties of elastic metamaterials to naturally select the higher
harmonics generated by nonlinear effects and to increase their signal-to noise
ratios, enabling the realization of time-reversal procedures for nonlinear
elastic source detection. The proposed device demonstrates its potential as an
efficient, compact, portable, passive apparatus for nonlinear elastic wave
sensing and damage detection.

makes Einstein's gravity so strong, that its influence to metric is shifted
from Planck to the Compton scale! Compatibility of the Kerr-Newman (KN) gravity
with quantum theory is achieved by implementation of the supersymmetric Higgs
model without modification of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We consider the
nonperturbative bag-like solution to supersymmetric generalized LG field model,
which creates a flat and supersymmetric vacuum state inside the bag, forming
the Compton zone for consistent work of quantum theory. The bag is deformable,
and its shape is controlled by BPS bound, providing compatibility of the bag
boundary with external gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) field. In
particular, for the spinning KN gravity the bag takes the form of oblate disk
with a circular string placed on the disk border. Excitations of the KN EM
field create circular traveling waves. The super-bag solution is naturally
upgraded to the Wess-Zumino supersymmetric QED model, indicating a bridge from
the nonperturbative super-bag to perturbative formalism of the conventional
QED.
