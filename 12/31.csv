the population count of species can be described via a set of linear equations.
However, except for some specific cases such as systems with linear reaction
propensities, the moment equations are underdetermined as a lower order moment
might depend upon a higher order moment. Here, we propose a method to find
lower, and upper bounds on stationary moments of molecular counts in a chemical
reaction system. The method exploits the fact that statistical moments of any
positive-valued random variable must satisfy some constraints. Such constraints
can be expressed as nonlinear inequalities on moments in terms of their lower
order moments, and solving them in conjugation with the stationary moment
equations results in bounds on the moments. Using two examples of biochemical
systems, we illustrate that not only one obtains upper and lower bounds on a
given stationary moment, but these bounds also improve as one uses more moment
equations and utilizes the inequalities for the corresponding higher order
moments. Our results provide avenues for development of moment approximations
that provide explicit bounds on moment dynamics for systems whose dynamics are
otherwise intractable.

corresponding CSI feedback in the UL. In particular, the base station (BS) can
transmit the FFT-based pilots with the carefully-selected phase shifts. Then
the user can rely on the so-called time-domain aggregate channel (TAC) to
derive the feedback of reduced imensionality according to either its own
knowledge about the statistics of the DL channels or the instruction from the

the relations between the terms in different lattices, for example relating
bivariate and trivariate decompositions. We point out that, in information gain
lattices, redundancy components are invariant across decompositions, but unique
and synergy components are decomposition-dependent. Exploiting the connection
between different lattices we propose a procedure to construct, in the general
multivariate case, information decompositions from measures of synergy or
unique information. We introduce an alternative type of mutual information
decompositions based on information loss lattices, with the role and invariance
properties of redundancy and synergy components exchanged with respect to gain
lattices. We study the correspondence between information gain and information
loss lattices and we define dual decompositions that allow overcoming the
intrinsic asymmetry between invariant and decomposition-dependent components,
which hinders the consistent joint characterization of synergy and redundancy.

amounts of electronic information and computer resources (which include
hardware, computer services, etc.) in open distributed environments. These
environments serve as a common platform for heterogeneous users (e.g.,
corporate, individuals etc.) by hosting customized user applications and
systems, providing ubiquitous access to the shared resources and requiring less
administrative efforts; as a result, they enable users and companies to
increase their productivity. Unfortunately, sharing of resources in open
environments has significantly increased the privacy threats to the users.
Indeed, shared electronic data may be exploited by third parties, such as Data
Brokers, which may aggregate, infer and redistribute (sensitive) personal
features, thus potentially impairing the privacy of the individuals. A way to
palliate this problem consists on controlling the access of users over the
potentially sensitive resources. Specifically, access control management
regulates the access to the shared resources according to the credentials of
the users, the type of resource and the privacy preferences of the
resource/data owners. The efficient management of access control is crucial in
large and dynamic environments. Moreover, in order to propose a feasible and
scalable solution, we need to get rid of manual management of rules/constraints
(in which most available solutions rely) that constitutes a serious burden for
the users and the administrators. Finally, access control management should be
intuitive for the end users, who usually lack technical expertise, and they may
find access control mechanism more difficult to understand and rigid to apply

mainly on the energy scale $f$ at which the global symmetry is broken and the
$t_\beta$ parameter, whereas there is little sensitivity to a mild change in
the values of other parameters of the model. While the $\tau$ AMDM is of the
order of $10^{-9}$, the real (imaginary) part of its AWMDM is of the order of
$10^{-9}$ ($10^{-10}$). These values seem to be out of the reach of the
expected experimental sensitivity of future experiments.

weak and strong transonic shocks under the perturbation of both the upstream
supersonic flow and the wedge boundary is proved. The problem is formulated as
a one-phase free boundary problem, in which the transonic shock is treated as a
free boundary. The full Euler equations are decomposed into two algebraic
equations and a first-order elliptic system of two equations in Lagrangian
coordinates. With careful elliptic estimates by using appropriate weighted
H\""older norms, the iteration map is defined and analyzed, and the existence of
its fixed point is established by performing the Schauder fixed point argument.
The careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions reveals
particular characters of the full Euler equations.

from several spectral line pairs with expected scale heights as per hydrostatic

we estimate non-thermal velocities in active region and quiet Sun. Non-thermal
velocities obtained from warm lines in active region first show increase and
later show either decrease or almost constant value with height in the far
off-limb region, whereas hot lines show consistent decrease. However, in the

show either gradual decrease or remain almost constant with height. Using these
obtained parameters, we further calculate Alfv\'en wave energy flux in the both

fluxes with height, and hence provide evidence of Alfv\'en wave damping.
Furthermore, we derive damping lengths of Alfv\'en waves in the both regions

obtained at different temperatures may be explained as either possible
temperature dependent damping or measurements obtained in different coronal
structures formed at different temperatures along the line-of-sight.

Equivalently, in the topologically non-trivial phase, the localization
functional introduced by Marzari and Vanderbilt diverges, as already noticed in
the case of the Haldane model. Our result is formulated by using only the

(SI-DG) is presented for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations on staggered space-time adaptive Cartesian grids (AMR) in two and
three space-dimensions. The pressure is written in the form of piecewise
polynomials on the main grid, which is dynamically adapted within a
cell-by-cell AMR framework. According to the time dependent main grid,
different face-based spatially staggered dual grids are defined for the
piece-wise polynomials of the respective velocity components. Arbitrary high
order of accuracy is achieved in space, while a very simple semi-implicit time
discretization is obtained via an explicit discretization of the nonlinear
convective terms, and an implicit discretization of the pressure gradient in
the momentum equation and of the divergence of the velocity field in the
continuity equation. The real advantages of the staggered grid arise in the
solution of the Schur complement associated with the saddle point problem of
the discretized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. after substituting
the discrete momentum equations into the discrete continuity equation. This
leads to a linear system for only one unknown, the scalar pressure. Indeed, the
resulting linear pressure system is shown to be symmetric and
positive-definite. The new space-time adaptive staggered DG scheme has been
thoroughly verified for a large set of non-trivial test problems in two and
three space dimensions, for which analytical, numerical or experimental
reference solutions exist. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first
staggered semi-implicit DG scheme for the incompressible Navier-Stokes

a general group based framework for multifield scalar field theories with
curved target spaces, which can be parametrized by the comoving curvature
perturbation ${\cal R}$ and the isocurvature perturbation tensor $S^{IJ}$. This
paper describes the dynamics and observables of these perturbations and
considers in some detail the special case of modular inflation as an extensive
class of two-field inflation theories with a conformally flat target space. It
is shown that the nonmodular nature of derivatives of modular forms leads to
CMB observables in modular invariant inflation theories that are in general
constructed from almost holomorphic modular forms. The phenomenology of the
model of $j$-inflation is compared to the recent observational constraints from
the Planck satellite and the BICEP2/Keck Array data.

flaring loop system during both the ascending and descending phases of the
registered M-class flare. The dynamical properties can also be classified by
different types of magnetic reconnection, related plasma ejection and aperiodic
flows, quasi-periodic oscillatory motions, and rapid temperature and density
changes, among others. The focus of the present paper is on a specific time
interval during the ascending (pre-flare) phase. Aims. The goal is to
understand the quasi-periodic behavior in both space and time of the magnetic
loop structures during the considered time interval. Methods.We have studied
the characteristic location, motion, and periodicity properties of the flaring
loops by examining space-time diagrams and intensity variation analysis along
the coronal magnetic loops using AIA intensity and HMI magnetogram images (from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)). Results. We detected bright plasma blobs
along the coronal loop during the ascending phase of the solar flare, the
intensity variations of which clearly show quasi-periodic behavior. We also
determined the periods of these oscillations. Conclusions. Two different
interpretations are presented for the observed dynamics. Firstly, the
oscillations are interpreted as the manifestation of non-fundamental harmonics
of longitudinal standing acoustic oscillations driven by the thermodynamically
nonequilibrium background (with time variable density and temperature). The
second possible interpretation we provide is that the observed bright blobs
could be a signature of a strongly twisted coronal loop that is kink unstable.

Remarkably, it has been shown that practical algorithms provide robust recovery
from noisy linear measurements acquired at a near optimal sampling rate. In
many real-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in
the canonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as wavelets or the
finite difference. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to the
analysis sparsity model but known extensions are limited to specific choices of
sensing matrix and sparsifying transform. In this paper, we propose a unified
theory for robust recovery of sparse signals in a general transform domain by
convex programming. In particular, our results apply to general acquisition and
sparsity models and show how the number of measurements for recovery depends on
properties of measurement and sparsifying transforms. Moreover, we also provide
extensions of our results to the scenarios where the atoms in the transform has
varying incoherence parameters and the unknown signal exhibits a structured
sparsity pattern. In particular, for the partial Fourier recovery of sparse
signals over a circulant transform, our main results suggest a uniformly random
sampling. Numerical results demonstrate that the variable density random
sampling by our main results provides superior recovery performance over known
sampling strategies.

selection, (ii) finite resolution, (iii) finite extraction radius, and (iv)
different methods for converting NR waveforms to luminosity, allow us to use NR

higher modes, also paves the way for improved inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform

transitions is developed. Starting from a fundamental four-dimensional field
theory at nonzero temperature and density, an effective three-dimensional field
theory with a sign problem is derived. Although charge conjugation
$\mathcal{C}$ is broken at finite density, there remains a symmetry under
$\mathcal{CK}$, where $\mathcal{K}$ is complex conjugation. We consider four
models: relativistic fermions, nonrelativistic fermions, static fermions and
classical particles. The thermodynamic behavior is extracted from
$\mathcal{CK}$-symmetric complex saddle points of the effective field theory at
tree level. The relativistic and static fermions show a liquid-gas transition,
manifesting as a first-order line at low temperature and high density,
terminated by a critical end point. In the cases of nonrelativistic fermions
and classical particles, we find no first-order liquid-gas transitions at tree
level. The mass matrix controlling the behavior of correlation functions is
obtained from fluctuations around the saddle points. Due to the $\mathcal{CK}$
symmetry of the models, the eigenvalues of the mass matrix can be complex. This
leads to the existence of disorder lines, which mark the boundaries where the
eigenvalues go from purely real to complex. The regions where the mass matrix
eigenvalues are complex are associated with the critical line. In the case of
static fermions, a powerful duality between particles and holes allows for the
analytic determination of both the critical line and the disorder lines.
Depending on the values of the parameters, either zero, one or two disorder
lines are found. Numerical results for relativistic fermions give a very
similar picture.

proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Parallel Programming.
  HMCS-T is a very involved protocol. The system is stateful; the values of
prior acquisition efforts affect the subsequent acquisition efforts. Also, the
status of successors, predecessors, ancestors, and descendants affect steps
followed by the protocol. The ability to make the protocol fully non-blocking
leads to modifications to the \texttt{next} field, which causes deviation from
the original MCS lock protocol both in acquisition and release. At several
places, unconditional field updates are replaced with SWAP or CAS operations.
  We follow a multi-step approach to prove the correctness of HMCS-T. To
demonstrate the correctness of the HMCS-T lock, we use the Spin model checking.
Model checking causes a combinatorial explosion even to simulate a handful of
threads. First, we understand the minimal, sufficient configurations necessary
to prove safety properties of a single level of lock in the tree. We construct
HMCS-T locks that represent these configurations. We model check these
configurations, which proves the correctness of components of an HMCS-T lock.
Finally, building upon these facts, we argue logically for the correctness of
HMCS-T<n>.

account for the mass anomalies in galactic systems without dark matter -- in
particular in their relation to MOND. Welcome addition to the MOND lore as it
is, this approach have reproduced, so far, only a small fraction of MOND
phenomenology, and is still rather tentative, both in its theoretical
foundations and in its phenomenology. What Verlinde has extracted from this
approach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no
road to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a
spherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to
calculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND
phenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except
asymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it
cannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to
conduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.
The formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in
an external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is
backed by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely
applied to all the above phenomena, and more. Verlinde's formula, as it now
stands, strongly conflicts with solar-system and possibly earth-surface
constraints, and cannot fully account for the mass anomalies in the cores of
galaxy clusters (a standing conundrum in MOND). The recent weak-lensing test of
the formula is, in fact, testing a cornerstone prediction of MOND, one that the
formula does reproduce, and which has been tested before in the very same way.

independently with a certain probability. In previous work we established a
phase transition for this model on the integers in the case of Pareto
distributed potential with parameter $\alpha > 1$ and fixed duplication
probability $p \in (0, 1)$: if $\alpha \ge 2$ the model completely localises,
whereas if $\alpha \in (1, 2)$ the model may localise on two sites. In this
paper we prove a new phase transition in the case that $\alpha \ge 2$ is fixed
but the duplication probability $p(n)$ varies with the distance from the
origin. We identify a critical scale $p(n) \to 1$, depending on $\alpha$, below
which the model completely localises and above which the model localises on
exactly two sites. We further establish the behaviour of the model in the

and temporal scales. It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro)
descriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a
compressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However,
recent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that
the causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more
informative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a
system (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the
system (the territory). This has been called causal emergence. While causal
emergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the
phenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of
the channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity,
and that different causal models of those systems take advantage of that
capacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale causal models
use the full causal capacity. Such macroscale causal models can either be
coarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous)
in various ways, which can improve the model's efficacy and its informativeness
via the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take
advantage of an information channel's capacity. As model choice increase, the
causal capacity of a system approaches the channel capacity. Ultimately, this
provides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some
systems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscopic model.

do so by formulating a minimalist Generalized Cohomology Hypothesis, which is
satisfied by existing proposals and captures essential aspects of SPT
classification. From this Hypothesis alone, formulas relating classifications
in different dimensions and/or protected by different symmetry groups are
derived. Our formalism is expected to work for fermionic as well as bosonic
phases, Floquet as well as stationary phases, and spatial as well as on-site
symmetries. As an application, we predict that the complete classification of
3-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with space group symmetry $G$ is $H^4_{\rm
Borel}\left(G;U(1)\right) \oplus H^1_{\rm group}\left(G;\mathbb Z\right)$,
where the $H^1$ term classifies phases beyond the Borel group cohomology
proposal.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the structure function (SF) analysis. If the
SF for the timescales shorter than the decorrelation timescale $\tau$ is a
single power-law and for the longer ones becomes flat (i.e., the white noise),
the auto-correlation function (ACF) of the signal can have the form of the
power exponential (PE). We show that the signal decorrelation timescale can be
measured directly from the SF as the timescale matching the amplitude 0.795 of
the flat SF part (at long timescales), and only then the measurement is
independent of the ACF PE power. Typically, the timescale has been measured at
an arbitrarily fixed SF amplitude, but as we prove, this approach provides
biased results because the AGN SF/PSD slopes, so the ACF shape, are not
constant and depend on either the AGN luminosity and/or the black hole mass. In
particular, we show that using such a method for the simulated SFs that include
a combination of empirically known dependencies between the AGN luminosity $L$
and both the SF amplitude and the PE power, and having no intrinsic $\tau-L$
dependence, produces a fake $\tau \propto L^\kappa$ relation with $0.3\lesssim
\kappa \lesssim 0.6$, that otherwise is expected from theoretical works
($\kappa \equiv 0.5$). Our method provides an alternative means for analyzing
AGN variability to the standard SF fitting. The caveats, for both methods, are
that the light curves must be sufficiently long (several years rest-frame) and
the ensemble SF assumes AGNs to have the same underlying variability process.

2016, A2744 hosts an estimated 2133 +/- 613 UDGs, ten times the number in Coma.
As noted by Lee & Jang 2016, A2744 contains numerous unresolved compact
objects, which those authors identified predominantly as globular clusters.
However, these objects have luminosities that are more consistent with
ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. The abundances of both UCDs and UDGs scale
with cluster mass as a power law with a similar exponent, although UDGs and
UCDs have very different radial distributions within the cluster. The radial
surface density distribution of UCDs rises sharply toward the cluster centre,
while the surface density distribution of the UDG population is essentially
flat. Together, these observations hint at a picture where some UCDs in A2744
may have once been associated with infalling UDGs. As UDGs fall in and
dissolve, they leave behind a residue of unbound ultra-compact dwarfs.

transmission spectrum via its effect on the atmospheric scale height, which in
turn determines the strength of absorption features. Here, we further explore
the applicability of \textit{MassSpec} to low-mass exoplanets -- specifically
those in the super-Earth size range for which radial velocity determinations of
the planetary mass can be extremely challenging and resource intensive.
Determining the masses of these planets is of the utmost importance because
their nature is otherwise highly unconstrained. Without knowledge of the mass,
these planets could be rocky, icy, or gas-dominated. To investigate the effects
of planetary mass on transmission spectra, we present simulated observations of
super-Earths with atmospheres made up of mixtures of H$_2$O and H$_2$, both
with and without clouds. We model their transmission spectra and run
simulations of each planet as it would be observed with \textit{JWST} using the
NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI instruments. We find that significant degeneracies
exist between transmission spectra of planets with different masses and
compositions, making it impossible to unambiguously determine the planet's mass

limiting their applicability in applications where consensus value needs to be
used in real time to perform a system level task. It also leads to wastage of
power and communication resources. In this article, an algorithm is proposed
which enables each node to detect in a distributed manner and in finite number
of iterations, when every agent in the network is within a user specified
threshold of the consensus value (approximate consensus) and hence terminate
further communications and computations associated with consensus iterations.
This article develops a distributed algorithm for achieving this approximate
consensus in presence of random time-varying bounded communication delays.
Moreover, the article instantiates the algorithm developed to distributively
determine the average of the initial values held by agents in finite number of
iterations. Specifically, this algorithm relies on distributively determining
the maximum and minimum of values held by the agents. The approach presented
here offers several advantages, including reduced computational complexity, and
hence, is suited for hardware implementation. An experimental test bed of
Raspberry-Pi agents that communicate wirelessly over neighborhoods is employed
as a platform to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

various other cuprates. This indicates that stripe order at low temperatures is
stabilized by the coupling of otherwise independent charge and spin density

uncovered in optomechanics, where in the classical regime the system exhibits
chaos but in the corresponding quantum regime the motion is regular - there
appears to be no signature of classical chaos whatsoever in the corresponding
quantum system, generating a paradox. We find that transient chaos, besides
being a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself, provides a resolution.
Using the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics
subject to continuous homodyne detection, we uncover transient chaos associated
with quantum trajectories. The transient behavior is consistent with chaos in
the classical limit, while the long term evolution of the quantum system is
regular. Transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum-classical
transition (QCT). Strikingly, as the system transitions from the quantum to the
classical regime, the average chaotic transient lifetime increases dramatically
(faster than the Ehrenfest time characterizing the QCT for isolated quantum
systems). We develop a physical theory to explain the scaling law.

under solitary waves based on energy bounds and nonmodal theory is performed.
The instability mechanism of this flow consists of a competition between
streamwise streaks and two- dimensional perturbations. For lower Reynolds
numbers and early times, streamwise streaks display larger amplification due to
their quadratic dependence on the Reynolds number, whereas two-dimensional
perturbations become dominant for larger Reynolds numbers and later times in
the deceleration region of this flow, as the maximum amplification of
two-dimensional perturbations grows exponentially with the Reynolds number. By
means of the present findings, we can give some indications on the physical
mecha- nism and on the interpretation of the results by direct numerical
simulation in (Vittori & Blondeaux 2008; Ozdemir et al. 2013) and by
experiments in (Sumer et al. 2010). In addition, three critical Reynolds
numbers can be defined for which the stability prop- erties of the flow change.
In particular, it is shown that this boundary layer changes from a
monotonically stable to a non-monotonically stable flow at a Reynolds number of
18.

important roles in science and engineering. Cluster-based reduced-order
modeling (CROM) was introduced to exploit the underlying low-dimensional
dynamics of complex systems. CROM builds a data-driven discretization of the
Perron-Frobenius operator, resulting in a probabilistic model for ensembles of
trajectories. A key advantage of CROM is that it embeds nonlinear dynamics in a
linear framework, and uncertainty can be managed with data assimilation. CROM
is typically computed on high-dimensional data, however, access to and
computations on this full-state data limit the online implementation of CROM
for prediction and control. Here, we address this key challenge by identifying
a small subset of critical measurements to learn an efficient CROM, referred to
as sparsity-enabled CROM. In particular, we leverage compressive measurements
to faithfully embed the cluster geometry and preserve the probabilistic
dynamics. Further, we show how to identify fewer optimized sensor locations
tailored to a specific problem that outperform random measurements. Both of
these sparsity-enabled sensing strategies significantly reduce the burden of
data acquisition and processing for low-latency in-time estimation and control.
We illustrate this unsupervised learning approach on three different
high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems from fluids with increasing
complexity, with one application in flow control. Sparsity-enabled CROM is a
critical facilitator for real-time implementation on high-dimensional systems
where full-state information may be inaccessible.

viewed as a preconditioner for $\mathcal{A}$. We prove contraction of the

$q$. Certainly the value of $q$ depends on the difference between $\mathcal{A}$

simple relations that suggest an optimal $\mathcal{A}_0$ (in a selected set of

with voltage-generated stress/strain dissipates much less energy than most
other magnetization rotation schemes, but its application to writing bits in
non-volatile magnetic memory has been hindered by the fundamental inability of
stress/strain to rotate magnetization by full 180 degrees. Normally,
stress/strain can rotate the magnetization of a shape anisotropic elliptical
nanomagnet by only up to 90 degrees, resulting in incomplete magnetization
reversal. Recently, we predicted that applying uniaxial stress sequentially
along two different axes that are not collinear with the major or minor axis of
the elliptical nanomagnet will rotate the magnetization by full 180 degrees.
Here, we demonstrate this complete 180 degree rotation in elliptical
Co-nanomagnets (fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate) at room temperature.
The two stresses are generated by sequentially applying voltages to two pairs
of shorted electrodes placed on the substrate such that the line joining the
centers of the electrodes in one pair intersects the major axis of a nanomagnet
at ~+30 degrees and the line joining the centers of the electrodes in the other
pair intersects at ~ -30 degrees. A finite element analysis has been performed
to determine the stress distribution underneath the nanomagnets when one or
both pairs of electrodes are activated, and this has been approximately
incorporated into a micromagnetic simulation of magnetization dynamics to
confirm that the generated stress can produce the observed magnetization
rotations. This result portends an extremely energy-efficient non-volatile
""straintronic"" memory technology predicated on writing bits in nanomagnets with
electrically generated stress.

domain $\Omega^{+}$. Then, we define interface conditions at the artificial
boundary $S$, from truncated versions of the well-known Wilcox and Karp

conditions previously defined, the order of the error induced by this ABC can
easily match the order of the numerical method in $\Omega^{-}$. We accomplish

sometimes undetectable in the sparse limit, i.e., that no algorithm can
identify a partition correlated with the partition used to generate an
instance, if the instance is sparse enough and infinitely large. In this
contribution, we treat the finite case explicitly, using arguments drawn from
information theory and statistics. We give a necessary condition for
finite-size detectability in the general SBM. We then distinguish the concept
of average detectability from the concept of instance-by-instance detectability
and give explicit formulas for both definitions. Using these formulas, we prove
that there exist large equivalence classes of parameters, where widely
different network ensembles are equally detectable with respect to our
definitions of detectability. In an extensive case study, we investigate the
finite-size detectability of a simplified variant of the SBM, which encompasses
a number of important models as special cases. These models include the
symmetric SBM, the planted coloring model, and more exotic SBMs not previously
studied. We conclude with three appendices, where we study the interplay of
noise and detectability, establish a connection between our
information-theoretic approach and random matrix theory, and provide proofs of
some of the more technical results.

Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution which is not a genuine classical probability
distribution. Despite several attempts, defining a uniform measure of
nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 95, 012330 (2017)] we have shown that
the existing well-known measures fail to quantify the NC of single mode states
that are generated under multiple NC-inducing operations. Recently, Ivan et.
al. [Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure of
non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy.
Here, we adopt this concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we
propose a new quantification of NC for the single mode quantum states of light
as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state and the maximum
Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by
subtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any
classical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann
entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in
particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation
of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical
computation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along
with the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the
broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.

we calculate the resulting constraints on generic models of DM, allowing for
the possibility of a non-negligible velocity-dependent component of the

gamma-ray flux is strongly dependent on these selections, particularly the
modelling of spike depletion effects due to gravitational interactions with
baryons, which affect the spike radius and steepness profile. We calculate
constraints on the DM parameter space for both attenuated and idealized spikes,
considering different choices for the steepness profiles in each case. We find
that for the most conservative selection of parameters, corresponding to a
depleted spike with an NFW cusp profile, the gamma-ray flux for a 100 GeV
thermal relic is lower than current observational constraints by several orders
of magnitude. For more optimistic choices of parameters corresponding to spikes
that have not been attenuated, bounds on DM masses can be obtained for a
variety of choices of steepness profiles. We then specialize to a class of
simplified models of fermionic DM that annihilate dominantly through the
$t-$channel exchange of two scalar mediators with arbitrary mixing angle
$\alpha$, and calculate the indirect detection constraints coming from the DM
spike. Along the way, we discuss constraints on the astrophysical parameters

quantitative shadow parameters, observing in particular that the differences in
the shadows mean radii are never larger than the percent level. Therefore,
generically, EdGB BHs cannot be excluded by (near future) shadow observations
alone. On the theoretical side, we find no clear signature of some exotic
features of EdGB BHs on the corresponding shadows, such as the regions of
negative (Komar, say) energy density outside the horizon. We speculate that
this is due to the fact that the Komar energy interior to the light rings (or
more precisely, the surfaces of constant radial coordinate that intersect the
light rings in the equatorial plane) is always smaller than the ADM mass, and
consequently the corresponding shadows are smaller than those of comparable
Kerr BHs. The analysis herein provides a clear example that it is the light
ring impact parameter, rather than its ""size"", that determines a BH shadow.

dynamics of networks of neurons rather than on single neurons. On the other
hand, the network dynamics reflect and arise from the integration and
coordination of the activity of populations of single neurons. Understanding
how single-neurons and neural-circuits dynamics complement each other to
produce brain functions is thus of paramount importance. LFPs and EEGs are good
indicators of the dynamics of mesoscopic and macroscopic populations of
neurons, while microscopic-level activities can be documented by measuring the
membrane potential, the synaptic currents or the spiking activity of individual
neurons. In this thesis we develop mathematical modelling and mathematical
analysis tools that can help the interpretation of joint measures of neural
activity at microscopic and mesoscopic or macroscopic scales. In particular, we
develop network models of recurrent cortical circuits that can clarify the
impact of several aspects of single-neuron (i.e., microscopic-level) dynamics
on the activity of the whole neural population (as measured by LFP). We then
develop statistical tools to characterize the relationship between the action
potential firing of single neurons and mass signals. We apply these latter
analysis techniques to joint recordings of the firing activity of individual
cell-type identified neurons and mesoscopic (i.e., LFP) and macroscopic (i.e.,
EEG) signals in the mouse neocortex. We identified several general aspects of
the relationship between cell-specific neural firing and mass circuit activity,
providing for example general and robust mathematical rules which infer
single-neuron firing activity from mass measures such as the LFP and the EEG.

quantum field theory. We compute the heat kernel expansion in the presence of

The Polyakov loop appears at finite temperature as a new gauge covariant
operator. We apply this method in the computation of the fully gauge invariant
effective action of QCD in the regime of high temperature. It is obtained the
dimensionally reduced effective action of QCD as well. In the context of chiral
quark models, in particular the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and the spectral quark
model, we apply this method to compute the low-energy chiral Lagrangian at
finite temperature. The coupling of the Polyakov loop with these models allows
to solve some inconsistencies appearing in the standard treatment at finite
temperature: generation of multi-quark states, large $N_c$ counting, etc. On
the other hand, we show that recent available lattice data for the renormalized
Polyakov loop above the deconfinement phase transition exhibit unequivocal
inverse power temperature corrections driven by a dimension 2 gluon condensate.
This simple ansatz provides a good overall description of the data throughout
the deconfinement phase until near the critical temperature with just two
parameters. Finally, we study several chiral quark models in the light of
chiral perturbation theory in curved space-time. The low energy structure of
the energy momentum tensor in these models with SU(3) flavor symmetry is
analyzed in the presence of external gravitational fields.

(OPSW) is considered, where the first-stage problem is to plan a path under the
uncertain environment and the second-stage problem is recourse action to make
sure that the length constraint is satisfied after the uncertainty is realized.
Two recourse models are introduced based on two different uncertainty
realization ways, one is based on sequentially realized weights which leads to
the recourse model proposed by Evers et al. (2014) and the other is based on
concurrently realized weights which leads to a new recourse model with less
variables and less constraints and is computationally more efficient.
Subsequently two two-stage robust models are introduced for OPSW based on the
two different recourse models, and the relationships between the two-stage
robust models and their corresponding static robsut models are investigated.
Theoretical conclusions are drawn which show that the two-stage robust models
are equivalent to their corresponding static robust models with the box
uncertainty set defined, and the two two-stage robust models are also
equivalent to each other even though they are based on different recourse
models. A case study is presented by comparing the two-stage robust models with
an one-stage robust model for OPSW. The numerical results of the comparative
studies show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed two-stage robust
models for dealing with the two-stage OPSW.

by the input and output circuits. Then, we discuss the parameter extraction
from experimental data and we report on the measured phase noise in some
selected devices of different node size and complexity. We observed flicker
noise between -80 and -130 dBrad^2/Hz at 1 Hz offset, and white noise down to
-165 dBrad^2/Hz in some fortunate cases and using the appropriate tricks. It
turns out that flicker noise is proportional to the reciprocal of the volume of
the transistor. This unpleasant conclusion is supported by a gedanken
experiment. Further experiments provide understanding on: (i) the interplay
between noise sources in the internal PLL, often present in FPGAs; (ii) the

approach to analyze multiple-frequency brain networks inferred from
magnetoencephalographic recordings during resting-states in AD subjects and
age-matched controls. Main results showed that brain networks tend to
facilitate information propagation across different frequencies, as measured by
the multi-participation coefficient (MPC). However, regional connectivity in AD
subjects was abnormally distributed across frequency bands as compared to
controls, causing significant decreases of MPC. This effect was mainly
localized in association areas and in the cingulate cortex, which acted, in the
healthy group, as a true inter-frequency hub. MPC values significantly
correlated with memory impairment of AD subjects, as measured by the total
recall score. Most predictive regions belonged to components of the
default-mode network that are typically affected by atrophy, metabolism
disruption and amyloid-beta deposition. We evaluated the diagnostic power of
the MPC and we showed that it led to increased classification accuracy (78.39%)

two-component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization
equilibrium and has a temperature $\sim$0.59 keV, while the hard component has
temperature $\sim$3.2 keV and ionization time-scale $\sim$$2.6\times10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$ s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line at energy of $\sim$6.5 keV
from this remnant. The overabundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe confirm that the
X-ray emission has an ejecta origin. The centroid energy of the Fe-K line
supports that G306.3$-$0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than
a core-collapse SN. The GeV gamma-ray emission from G306.3$-$0.9 and its
surrounding were analyzed using about 6 years of Fermi data. We report about
the non-detection of G306.3$-$0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray
source in the south-west of G306.3$-$0.9 with a significance of
$\sim$13$\sigma$. We discuss several scenarios for these results with the help
of data from other wavebands to understand the SNR and its neighborhood.

This model could be seen as a cheap way of preventing for example a malware or

bootstrap percolation models, a particular class of monotone cellular automata.
In the two dimensional lattice there is now a quite satisfactory understanding
of their evolution starting from a random initial condition, with a strikingly
beautiful universality picture for their critical behaviour. Much less is known
for their non-monotone stochastic counterpart, namely kinetically constrained
models (KCM). In KCM each vertex is resampled (independently) at rate one by
tossing a p-coin iff it can be infected in the next step by the bootstrap
model. In particular infection can also heal, hence the non-monotonicity.
Besides the connection with bootstrap percolation, KCM have an interest in
their own as they feature some of the most striking features of the
liquid/glass transition, a major and still largely open problem in condensed
matter physics. In this paper we pave the way towards proving universality
results for KCM similar to those for bootstrap percolation. Our novel and
general approach establishes a close connection between the critical scaling of
characteristic time scales for KCM and the scaling of the critical length in
critical bootstrap models. Although the full proof of universality for KCM is
deferred to a forthcoming paper, here we apply our general method to the
Friedrickson-Andersen k-facilitated models, amongst the most studied KCM, and
to the Gravner-Griffeath model. In both cases our results are close to optimal.

s-curves have chord angles not exceeding $\pi/2$ in magnitude. With this setup,
we have identified a sufficient condition for the $G^2$ regularity of optimal
interpolating curves. This sufficient condition relates to the stencil angles
$\{\psi_j\}$, where $\psi_j$ is defined as the angular change in direction from
segment $[P_{j-1},P_j]$ to segment $[P_j,P_{j+1}]$. A distinguished angle
$\Psi$ ($\approx 37^\circ$) is identified, and we show that if the stencil
angles satisfy $|\psi_j|<\Psi$, then optimal interpolating curves are globally

problem of major interest in different areas of quantum and classical physics.
In Hermitian models, several dynamical decoupling schemes have been suggested,
in which the discrete-continuum interaction can be substantially reduced and
even suppressed. In this work we consider a discrete state interacting with a
continuum via a time-dependent {\em non-Hermitian} coupling with finite (albeit
arbitrarily long) duration, and show rather generally that for a wide class of
coupling temporal shapes, in which the real and imaginary parts of the coupling
are related each other by a Hilbert transform, the discrete state returns to
its initial condition after the interaction with the continuum, while the
continuum keeps trace of the interaction. Such a behavior, which does not have
any counterpart in Hermitian dynamics, can be referred to as non-Hermitian {\em
pseudo} decoupling. Non-Hermitian pseudo decoupling is illustrated by
considering a non-Hermitian extension of the Fano-Anderson model in a
one-dimensional tight-binding lattice. Scuh a non-Hermitian model can describe,
for example, photonic hopping dynamics in a tight-binding chain of optical
microrings or resonators, in which non-Hermitian coupling can be realized by
fast modulation of the real and imaginary (gain/loss) parts of the refractive
index of the edge microring.

properties of GLHUA double layer cloak; Using GL no scattering inversion and
the pre cloak condition 6.1 to 6.4 in paper [1], we create GLHUA outer layer

We proved theorem 4.1 to theorem 4.4 that the phase velocity of the
electromagnetic wave in GLHUA outer layer cloak is less than light speed and
tends to zero at the boundary $r=R_1$, the EM wave tends to zero at $r=R1$;
When source $r_s > R_2$ in the outside of the cloak and observer $r_o < R_o$ in
the concealment, then $\vec E(\vec r_o)=0$ and $\vec H(\vec r_o)=0$ that is
proved in theorem 5.1 and 5.3. We prove that the EM wave excited in outside of
the cloak can not propagation penetrate into the concealment. In theorem 5.4 to
5.6, we rigorously proved the EM wave excited in outside of the cloak can not
be disturbed by the cloak. In theorem 6.1 to theorem 6.6, we prove that the EM
wave excited in the concealment can not propagate to outside of GLHUA inner
cloak. we prove that the EM wave excited in the concealment can not be

geometrical (anti)clusters formed in SU(2) gluodynamics by the Polyakov loops

gluodynamics as a transition between two liquids during which one of the liquid
droplets (the largest cluster of a certain Polyakov loop sign) experiences a
condensation, while the droplet of another liquid (the next to the largest
cluster of the opposite sign of Polyakov loop) evaporates. The clusters of
smaller sizes form two accompanying gases, which behave oppositely to their
liquids. The liquid droplet formula is used to analyze the size distributions
of the gaseous (anti)clusters. The fit of these distributions allows us to
extract the temperature dependence of surface tension and the value of Fisher
topological exponent $\tau$ for both kinds of gaseous clusters. It is shown
that the surface tension coeficient of gaseous (anti)clusters can serve as an
order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in SU(2) gluodynamics.
The Fisher topological exponent $\tau$ of clusters and anticlusters is found to
have the same value $1.806 \pm 0.008$. This value disagrees with the famous
Fisher droplet model, but it agrees well with an exactly solvable model of the
nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. This finding may evidence for the fact
that the SU(2) gluodynamics and this exactly solvable model of nuclear
liquid-gas phase transition are in the same universality class.

interest in bioinformatics and several methods including GC Skew, Z curve,
auto-correlation etc. have been explored in the past. In this paper, we have
extended the auto-correlation method to predict ORI location with much higher
resolution for prokaryotes. The proposed complex correlation method (iCorr)
converts the genome sequence into a sequence of complex numbers by mapping the
nucleotides to {+1,-1,+i,-i} instead of {+1,-1} used in the auto-correlation
method (here, 'i' is square root of -1). Thus, the iCorr method uses
information about the positions of all the four nucleotides unlike the earlier
auto-correlation method which uses the positional information of only one
nucleotide. Also, this earlier method required visual inspection of the
obtained graphs to identify the location of origin of replication. The proposed
iCorr method does away with this need and is able to identify the origin
location simply by picking the peak in the iCorr graph. The iCorr method also
works for a much smaller segment size compared to the earlier auto-correlation
method, which can be very helpful in experimental validation of the
computational predictions. We have also developed a variant of the iCorr method
to predict ORI location in eukaryotes and have tested it with the
experimentally known origin locations of S. cerevisiae with an average accuracy
of 71.76%.
