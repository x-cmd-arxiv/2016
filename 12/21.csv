perturbations in the universe and its numerical solutions play a central role
in cosmology. We revisit this system of differential equations and present a
detailed investigation of its mathematical properties. For this purpose, we
focus on a simplified set of equations aimed at describing the broad features
of the matter power spectrum. We first perform an eigenvalue analysis and study
the onset of oscillations in the system signaled by the transition from real to
complex eigenvalues. We then provide a stability criterion of different
numerical schemes for this linear system and estimate the associated step-size.
We elucidate the stiffness property of the Einstein-Boltzmann system and show
how it can be characterized in terms of the eigenvalues. While the parameters
of the system are time dependent making it non-autonomous, we define an
adiabatic regime where the parameters vary slowly enough for the system to be
quasi-autonomous. We summarize the different regimes of the system for these
different criteria as function of wave number $k$ and scale factor $a$. We also
provide a compendium of analytic solutions for all perturbation variables in 6
limits on the $k$-$a$ plane and express them explicitly in terms of initial
conditions. These results are aimed to help the further development and testing
of numerical cosmological Boltzmann solvers.

efficiency ever reported for a solar cell. Recent reports of photon recycling
in perovskite solar cells suggest that, once optimized, it may as well achieve
GaAs-like performance. In this paper, we show that GaAs and perovskite cells
recycle photons in different ways. First, although bare-perovskite has been
shown to have lifetimes (~1us) in the radiative limit, non-radiative
recombination at the transport layers restricts the solar cell operation far
below the ""photon-recycling"" regime. GaAs cells have no such limitation.
Second, even if the transport layers were optically and electrically perfect,
the poor mobility of the perovskite layer would still restrict the optimum
thickness ~1um. Thus, a very high quality mirror (reflectivity >96%) is
required to utilize photon-recycling. The mirror reflectivity restriction was
far more relaxed for the thicker (~2-3um) GaAs cells. Therefore, a nontrivial
co-optimization of device geometry, mirror reflectivity, and material choice is
necessary for achieving highest theoretical efficiency anticipated for
perovskite cells.

of a sharp drop in resistance to zero at $T_c$, its downward shift with

spectroscopy study of this new superconductor. Experimental results for the
optical reflectivity of H$_3$S, under high pressure of 150 GPa, for several
temperatures and over the range 60 to 600 meV of photon energies, are compared
with theoretical calculations based on Eliashberg theory using DFT results for
the electron-phonon spectral density $\alpha^2$F($\Omega$). Two significant
features stand out: some remarkably strong infrared active phonons at $\approx$
160 meV and a band with a depressed reflectance in the superconducting state in
the region from 450 meV to 600 meV. In this energy range, as predicted by
theory, H$_3$S is found to become a better reflector with increasing
temperature. This temperature evolution is traced to superconductivity
originating from the electron-phonon interaction. The shape, magnitude, and
energy dependence of this band at 150 K agrees with our calculations. This
provides strong evidence of a conventional mechanism. However, the unusually
strong optical phonon suggests a contribution of electronic degrees of freedom.

The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with

provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that
equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us
in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium
assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses
by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and
stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions.
Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired

variance decomposition (DIVIDE) based on q-space trajectory encoding (QTE) at
clinical MRI systems with varying performance. DIVIDE is used to separate
diffusional heterogeneity into components that arise due to isotropic and
anisotropic tissue structures. Methods: We designed imaging protocols for
DIVIDE using numerically optimized gradient waveforms for diffusion encoding.
Imaging was performed at systems with magnetic field strengths between 1.5 and
7 T, and gradient amplitudes between 33 and 80 mT/m. Technical feasibility was
assessed from signal characteristics and quality of parameter maps in a single
volunteer scanned at all systems. Results: The technical feasibility of QTE and
DIVIDE was demonstrated at all systems. The system with the highest performance
allowed whole-brain DIVIDE at 2 mm isotropic voxels. The system with the lowest
performance required a spatial resolution of 2.5x2.5x4 mm3 to yield a
sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: Whole-brain DIVIDE based on QTE
is feasible at the investigated MRI systems. This demonstration indicates that
tissue features beyond those accessible by conventional diffusion encoding may
be explored on a wide range of MRI systems.

at z=0 and z~1-2 by applying an analytical model of galactic clumpy gas disks
to samples of local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs, submillimeter (smm), and high-z
starforming galaxies. The model gas and dust temperatures are determined by the
heating and cooling equilibrium. Dense clouds are heated by turbulent
mechanical and cosmic ray heating. The molecular abundances of individual gas
clouds are determined by a detailed chemical network involving the cloud
lifetime, density, and temperature. Molecular line emission is calculated with
an escape probability formalism. The model calculates simultaneously the total
gas mass, HI/H_2 mass, the gas velocity dispersion, IR luminosity, IR spectral
energy distribution, CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED), HCN(1-0), and
HCO+(1-0) emission of a galaxy given its size, integrated star formation rate,
stellar mass radial profile, rotation curve, and Toomre Q parameter. The model
reproduces the observed CO luminosities and SLEDs of all sample galaxies within
the model uncertainties (~0.3 dex). Whereas the CO emission is robust against
the variation of model parameters, the HCN and HCO+ emission is sensitive to
the chemistry of the interstellar medium. The CO and HCN mass-to-light
conversion factors including CO-dark H_2 are given and compared to the values
found in the literature. Both, the HCN and HCO+ emission trace the dense
molecular gas to a factor of ~2 for the local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs and
smm-galaxies. About 80% of the molecular line emission of compact starburst
galaxies originates in non-selfgravitating gas clouds. The integrated
Kennicutt-Schmidt law has a slope of ~1 for the local spirals, ULIRGs, and
smm-galaxies, whereas the slope is 1.7 for high-z starforming galaxies.

Jansky Very Large Array at 6, 8.5, 11.5 and 15 GHz of the double-peaked
emission-line galaxy 2MASXJ12032061+1319316. The radio emission has a prominent
S-shaped morphology with highly symmetric radio jets that extend over a
distance of $\sim1.5^{\prime\prime}$ (1.74~kpc) on either side of the core of
size $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$(116~pc). The radio jets have a helical structure
resembling the precessing jets in the galaxy NGC~326 which has confirmed dual
active galactic nuclei (AGN). The nuclear bulge velocity dispersion gives an
upper limit of $(1.56\pm$0.26$)\times$10$^8$~M$_{\odot}$ for the total mass of
nuclear black hole(s). We present a simple model of precessing jets in
2MASXJ1203 and find that the precession timescale is around 10$^5$ years: this
matches the source lifetime estimate via spectral aging. We find that the
expected super massive black hole (SMBH) separation corresponding to this
timescale is 0.02 pc. We used the double peaked emission lines in 2MASXJ1203 to
determine an orbital speed for a dual AGN system and the associated jet
precession timescale, which turns out to be more than the Hubble time, making
it unfeasible. We conclude that the S-shaped radio jets are due to jet
precession caused either by a binary/dual SMBH system, a single SMBH with a
tilted accretion disk or a dual AGN system where a close pass of the secondary
SMBH in the past has given rise to jet precession.

parameters such as band gap (Eg), Urbach energy (EU) and Urbach focus (E0) are
estimated in the range of 300 K to 470K. It is observed that near structural
phase transition temperatures there exists two value of E0, suggesting presence
of electronic heterogeneity over wide temperature range. Further near
transition temperature EU shows metastability i.e. value of EU at temperature T
is not constant but is a function of time (t). Interestingly it is observed
that the ratio of EU(t=0)/ EU(t = tm), is almost remains constant at 295 K
(pure tetragonal phase) and at 450 K (pure cubic phase), whereas this ratio
shows decreasing behavior close to structural phase transition temperature,
which confirms the presence of electronic metastibility in the pure BaTiO3. The
observed metastibility can be fitted with the stretch exponents relaxation
behavior, suggesting the presence of dynamic heterogeneous electronic disorder
present in the sample across the transition. Further it appears that these
metastable Urbach tail states (electronic disorder) may couple with the soft
phonon modes and responsible for the observed terahertz dielectric relaxation

triplet. The heavy scalar singlet, which is expected to drive an inflation, and
the dark matter fermion triplet are odd under an unbroken $Z_2^{}$ discrete

a tree-level type-III seesaw and then mediates a three-body decay of the

localization have brought this question into sharp focus: rigid supersymmetry
on a curved boundary requires specific geometric structures, and general
arguments imply that BPS observables, such as the partition function, are
invariant under certain deformations of these structures. One can then ask if
the dual holographic observables are similarly invariant. We study this
question in minimal N = 2 gauged supergravity in four and five dimensions. In
four dimensions we show that holographic renormalization precisely reproduces
the expected field theory results. In five dimensions we find that no choice of
standard holographic counterterms is compatible with supersymmetry, which leads
us to introduce novel finite boundary terms. For a class of solutions
satisfying certain topological assumptions we provide some independent tests of
these new boundary terms, in particular showing that they reproduce the

analysing the dimuon mass distribution. The analysis is based on $pp$ collision
data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 $\rm fb^{-1}$ collected by
the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012. The long-distance contribution to the
$B^{+}\to K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay is modelled as a sum of relativistic
Breit--Wigner amplitudes representing different vector meson resonances
decaying to muon pairs, each with their own magnitude and phase. The measured
phases of the $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ resonances are such that the interference
with the short-distance component in dimuon mass regions far from their pole
masses is small. In addition, constraints are placed on the Wilson
coefficients, $\mathcal{C}_{9}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{10}$, and the branching
fraction of the short-distance component is measured.

understanding black hole dynamics, quantum chaos, and thermalization. We study
out of equilibrium scenarios in these systems and show they display perfect
decoherence at all times. This peculiar feature makes them very attractive in
the context of the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of
classical general relativity. Based on this feature and unitarity, we propose a
rate/continuity equation for the dynamics of the $\mathcal{O}(e^N)$ microstates
probabilities. The effective permutation symmetry of the models drastically
reduces the number of variables, allowing for compact expressions of n-point
correlation functions and entropy of the microscopic distribution. Further
assuming a generalized Fermi golden rule allows finding analytic formulas for
the kernel spectrum at finite $N$, providing a series of short and long time
scales controlling the out of equilibrium dynamics of this model. This approach
to chaos, long time scales, and $1/N$ corrections might be tested in future
experiments.

  Li-rich Unknown Li-Sn Compounds: A Step Towards Improvement of Li-Sn
  Batteries",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Volume expansion and elastic softening of Sn anode on lithiation result in
mechanical degradation and pulverization of Sn, affecting the overall
performance of Li-Sn batteries. It can however be overcome by using exotic high
pressure quenched phase as prelithiated reagent. Moreover, it is known that
under pressure many unusual stoichiometric which are basically impossible at
ambient pressure, can be synthesized, that may even survive the decompression
from high to ambient pressure.We therefore have performed a comprehensive study
using evolutionary algorithm and density functional theory based simulations to
understand the lithiation of Sn anode at pressure ranging from 1 atm to 20 GPa.
The ground state structures of all stable and metastable Li-Sn compounds have
been identified at ambient and moderate pressures and their properties have
been studied to understand the role of pressure in re-defining the reaction
mechanism during charging-discharging process in Li-ion batteries. Besides the
well-known existing Li-Sn compounds, our studies reveal the existence of five
unreported stoichiometries (Li8Sn3, Li3Sn1, Li4Sn1, Li5Sn1, and Li7Sn1) and
their associated crystal structures at ambient and high pressure. While Li8Sn3
has been identified as one of the most stable Li-Sn compound in the entire
pressure range (1 atm-20 GPa), the pressure induced Li-rich compounds like
Li5Sn1 and Li7Sn1 have been classified as providing higher theoretical
gravimetric capacity of 1129 and 1580 mAh/g), respectively, than the capacity
of the known most lithiated phase, i.e., Li17Sn4 (960 mAh/g).Most importantly,
our calculations show reduction in volume expansion by ~ 50% at 20 GPa, and
reveal that the application of pressure can reduce the chance of Li plating and
improve the mechanical properties, which are desired to make the battery safer
and its life longer.

praseodymium magnetic moments. It is oriented perpendicular to the field of SDW
on iron nuclei. The shape of SDW is almost rectangular at low temperatures and
it transforms into roughly triangular form around 'nematic' transition at about
140 K. Praseodymium magnetic order leads to the substantial enhancement of SDW
due to the large orbital contribution to the magnetic moment of praseodymium. A
transferred field indicates presence of strong magnetic susceptibility

electron system (2DES) in the integer quantum Hall regime. The alternating
screening properties of compressible and incompressible strips are formed due
to edge effects together with electron-electron interactions. As it is well
known, the Landau quantization emanates from strong perpendicular magnetic
fields. The (Landau) energy levels are broadened due to impurities, which we
embedded their effects in density of states (DOS). In a basic level DOS has two
different forms: the Gaussian and semi-elliptic descriptions. The second form
is calculated within the self consistent Born approximation (SCBA). Having in
hand the density of states, we obtain both the longitudinal and Hall
(transversal) conductivities ($\sigma_{l}, \sigma_{H}$) utilizing
Thomas-Fermi-Poisson approximation to calculate position dependent charge
density profile and use Drude formalism to obtain transport coefficients.
Since, the definition of capacitance is closely related with compressibility
via DOS, (local) screening properties of 2DES is extremely important to
understand local capacitances. Here we numerically simulate a translational
invariant Hall bar subject to high magnetic fields which is perpendicular to
the plane of the 2DES using realistic parameters extracted from the related
experiments. Using the above mentioned approaches the local capacitances are
calculated, numerically. Our findings are in perfect agreement with related
experimental results which are based on a dynamic scanning capacitance

strength. In the BDT junction with the lowest coupling, many-body corrections
reduce the overestimation on the conductance to a factor two, improving the

perturbation gets resonantly amplified if the frequency of DM oscillations is
close to a (half-)integer multiple of the orbital frequency of the system and
leads to a secular variation of the orbital period. We suggest to use binary
pulsars as probes of this scenario and estimate their sensitivity. While the
current accuracy of observations is not yet sufficient to probe the purely

that are competitive with other bounds. The sensitivity will increase with the

$\Bbb F$ with its algebraic closure $\overline{\Bbb F}$, let
$\text{Poly}^{d,m}_n(\Bbb F)$ denote the space of all $m$-tuples
$(f_1(z),\cdots ,f_m(z))\in \Bbb F [z]$ of monic polynomials of the same degree
$d$ such that polynomials $f_1(z),\cdots ,f_m(z)$ have no common root in
$\overline{\Bbb F}$ of multiplicity $\geq n$. These spaces were defined by Farb
and Wolfson in \cite{FW} as generalizations of spaces first studied by Arnold,
Vassiliev, Segal and others in different contexts. In \cite{FW} they obtained
algebraic geometrical and arithmetic results about the topology of these
spaces. In this paper we investigate the homotopy type of these spaces for the
case $\Bbb F =\mathbb{C}$. Our results generalize those of \cite{FW} for $\Bbb

luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and dwarf galaxies. An additional, and equally
important, aim of this pilot study is to investigate the consistency between
the predictions of several BH scaling relations and the fundamental plane of
black hole activity (FP-BH). Methods: We use X-ray and radio luminosity
relations in accreting BHs, along with the latest scaling relations between the
mass of the central black hole (MBH) and the properties of its host spheroid,
to predict MBH in seven LLAGN, that were previously reported to be in the IMBH
regime. Namely, we use the recently re-evaluated MBH - Msph (Msph : spheroid
absolute magnitude at 3.6 microm) scaling relation for spiral galaxies, the MBH
- nsph (nsph : major axis Sersic index of the bulge) relation, the MBH - PA
(PA: pitch angle) relation and the FP-BH for weakly accreting BHs, to
independently estimate MBH in all seven galaxies. Results: We find that all
LLAGN in our list have low-mass central black holes - with log MBH/Msol~6.5 on
average - but they are, not IMBHs. All 4 methods used predicted consistent BH
masses, in the 1sigma range. Furthermore, we report that, in contrast to
previous classification, galaxy NGC 4470 is bulge-less, and cast doubts on the
AGN classification of NGC 3507. Conclusions: We find that our latest,
state-of-the-art techniques for bulge magnitude & Sersic index computations and
the most recent updates of the MBH - Lsph, MBH - nsph , MBH - PA relations and
the FP-BH produce consistent results in the low mass regime. We establish a
multiple method approach for predicting BH masses in the regime where their
spheres-of- grav. influence cannot be spatially resolved. Our approach
mitigates against outliers from any one relation and provides a more robust
average prediction. We will use our new method to revisit more IMBH candidates
in LLAGN

A large number of different variants of LBP have been developed to improve its
robustness, and to increase its discriminative power and applicability to
different types of problems. In this chapter, the most recent and important
variants of LBP in 2D, spatiotemporal, 3D, and 4D domains are surveyed.
Interesting new developments of LBP in 1D signal analysis are also considered.

beam interacting with a counterpropagating superstrong short focused laser
pulse are investigated in a quantum regime when the electron's radiation
dominates its dynamics. We consider the electron-laser interaction at
near-reflection conditions when pronounced high-energy gamma-ray bursts arise
in the backward-emission direction with respect to the initial motion of the
electrons. The quantum stochastic nature of the gamma-photon emission is
exhibited in the angular distributions of the radiation and explained in an
intuitive picture. Although, the visibility of the stochasticity signatures
depends on the laser and electron beam parameters, the signatures are of a
qualitative nature and robust. The stochasticity, a fundamental quantum
property of photon emission, should thus be measurable rather straightforwardly
with laser technology available in near future.

approximation to treat disorder. Fe$_2$Ta is found to be ferromagnetic with a
saturation magnetization of $\mu_0 M_\text{s} = 0.66~\mathrm{T}$ while, in
contrast to earlier computational work, Fe$_2$W is found to be ferrimagnetic
with $\mu_0 M_\text{s} = 0.35~\mathrm{T}$. The transition from the ferri- to
the ferromagnetic state occurs for $x \leq 0.1$. The magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy (MAE) is calculated to $1.25~\mathrm{MJ/m^3}$ for Fe$_2$Ta
and $0.87~\mathrm{MJ/m^3}$ for Fe$_2$W. The MAE is found to be smaller for all
values $x$ in Fe$_2$Ta$_{1-x}$W$_x$ than for the end compounds and it is
negative (in-plane anisotropy) for $0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$. The MAE is carefully
analysed in terms of the electronic structure. Even though there are weak 5d
contributions to the density of states at the Fermi energy in both end
compounds, a reciprocal space analysis, using the magnetic force theorem,
reveals that the MAE originates mainly from regions of the Brillouin zone with
strong 3d-5d hybridisation near the Fermi energy. Perturbation theory and its
applicability in relation to the MAE is discussed.

ME-distribution for SNR processing operations to give the effective channel

characterize the pdf of discrete-time signal r.v.s, thus extending the
ME-distribution matrix form to new generalized 1D/2D-Gaussian-, and Rayleigh-,
distribution-like matrix forms. Our findings here, strengthen the observation
from [1], [2], and indicates that the ME-distribution can be a promising tool

its conjugate but is not definable over the reals. Such curves, together with
real Riemann surfaces, form the real locus of the moduli space $\mathcal M_g$.
This paper deals with the classification of pseudoreal curves according to the
structure of their automorphism group. We follow two different approaches
existing in the literature: one coming from number theory, dealing more
generally with fields of moduli of projective curves, and the other from
complex geometry, through the theory of NEC groups. Using the first approach,
we prove that the automorphism group of a pseudoreal Riemann surface $X$ is
abelian if $X/Z({\rm Aut}(X))$ has genus zero, where $Z({\rm Aut}(X))$ is the
center of ${\rm Aut}(X)$. This includes the case of $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces,
already known by results of Huggins and Kontogeorgis. By means of the second
approach and of elementary properties of group extensions, we show that $X$ is
not pseudoreal if the center of $G={\rm Aut}(X)$ is trivial and either ${\rm
Out}(G)$ contains no involutions or ${\rm Inn}(G)$ has a group complement in
${\rm Aut}(G)$. This extends and gives an elementary proof (over $\mathbb C$)
of a result by D\`ebes and Emsalem. Finally, we provide an algorithm,
implemented in MAGMA, which classifies the automorphism groups of pseudoreal
Riemann surfaces of genus $g\geq 2$, once a list of all groups acting for such
genus, with their signature and generating vectors, are given. This program,
together with the database provided by J. Paulhus in \cite{Pau15}, allowed us
to classifiy pseudoreal Riemann surfaces up to genus $10$, extending previous
results by Bujalance, Conder and Costa.

find that both thermal comptonisation and relativistically blurred reflection
models provide the most acceptable spectral fits with plausible physical
explanations to the origin of the soft excess than do multicolour disc
blackbody and smeared wind absorption models. This motivated us to study the
variability properties of the soft and the hard X-ray emissions from the source
and the relationship between them to put further constraints on the above
models. Our analysis reveals that the variation in the $3.0 - 10.0$ keV band
lags that in the $0.3 - 1.0$ keV by $600^{+290}_{-280}$ s, while the lag
between the $1.0 - 10.0$ keV and $0.3 - 1.0$ keV is $980^{+500}_{-500}$ s. This
implies that the X-ray emissions are possibly emanating from different regions
within the system. From these values, we estimate the X-ray emission region to
be within $20R_g$ of the central supermassive black hole (where $R_g=GM/c^2$,
$M$ is the mass of black hole, $G$ the Newton gravitational constant and $c$
the speed of light). Furthermore, we use XMM-Newton and Kepler photometric
lightcurves of the source to search for possible nonlinear signature in the

Karl Popper proposed an experiment involving spatially separated entangled
particles. In this experiment, one of the particles passes through a very
narrow slit, and thereby its position becomes well-defined. This particle
therefore diffracts into a large divergence angle; this effect can be
understood as a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Popper
further argued that its entangled partner would become comparably localized in
position, and that, according to his understanding of the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics, the \qo{mere knowledge} of the position of
this particle would cause it also to diffract into a large divergence angle.
Popper recognized that such behaviour could violate the principle of causality
in that the slit could be removed and the partner particle would be expected to
respond instantaneously. Popper thus concluded that it was most likely the case
that in an actual experiment the partner photon would not undergo increased
diffractive spreading and thus that the Copenhagen interpretation is incorrect.
Here, we report and analyze the results of an implementation of Popper's
proposal. We find that the partner beam does not undergo increased diffractive
spreading. Our work resolves many of the open questions involving Popper's
proposal, and it provides further insight into the nature of entanglement and
its relation to the uncertainty principle of correlated particles.

that are too large to be the product of stellar evolution. The multiperiodic
Delta Scuti stars are well suited to study these changes. This requires a very
large amount of photometric data covering years and decades as well as mode
identifications. We have examined over 800 nights of high-precision photometry
of the multiperiodic pulsator 4 CVn obtained from 1966 through 2012. Because
most of the data were obtained in adjacent observing seasons, it is possible to
derive very accurate period values for a number of the excited pulsation modes
and to study their systematic changes from 1974 to 2012. Most pulsation modes
show systematic significant period and amplitude changes on a timescale of
decades. For the well-studied modes, around 1986 a general reversal of the
directions of both the positive and negative period changes occurred.
Furthermore, the period changes between the different modes are strongly
correlated, although they differ in size and sign. For the modes with known
values of the spherical degree and azimuthal order, we find a correlation
between the direction of the period changes and the identified azimuthal order,
m. The associated amplitude changes generally have similar timescales of years
or decades, but show little systematic or correlated behavior from mode to
mode. A natural explanation for the opposite behavior of the prograde and
retrograde modes is that their period changes are driven by a changing rotation
profile. The changes in the rotation profile could in turn be driven by
processes, perhaps the pulsations themselves, that redistribute angular
momentum within the star. In general, different modes have different rotation
kernels, so this will produce period shifts of varying magnitude for different
modes.

prepare-and-measure quantum protocols using devices whose behavior must not be
characterized nor trusted, except for a single assumption on the dimension of
the Hilbert space characterizing the quantum carriers. Here, we propose instead
to constrain the quantum carriers through a bound on the mean value of a
well-chosen observable. This modified assumption is physically better motivated
than a dimension bound and closer to the description of actual experiments. In
particular, we consider quantum optical schemes where the source emits quantum
states described in an infinite-dimensional Fock space and model our assumption
as an upper bound on the average photon number in the emitted states. We
characterize the set of correlations that may be exhibited in the simplest
possible scenario compatible with our new framework, based on two
energy-constrained state preparations and a two-outcome measurement.
Interestingly, we uncover the existence of quantum correlations exceeding the
set of classical correlations that can be produced by devices behaving in a
purely pre-determined fashion (possibly including shared randomness). This
feature suggests immediate applications to certified randomness generation.
Along this line, we analyze the achievable correlations in several
prepare-and-measure optical schemes with a mean photon number constraint and
demonstrate that they allow for the generation of certified randomness. Our
simplest optical scheme works by the on-off keying of an attenuated laser
source followed by photocounting. It opens the path to more sophisticated
energy-constrained semi-device-independent quantum cryptography protocols, such
as quantum key distribution.

  High-performance computing is a special case where overall throughput demands

theoretically possible I/O error (like permission denied, loss of connection,

efficiently optimised using a genetic algorithm to minimise a weighted cost
function between matching the substation data and the individual mean daily

concavo-convex shape. We calculate the configuration surface of the properly
shaped bottom that simulates precisely the Newtonian or pseudo-Newtonian
gravitational potentials. Like the spatial part of the Schwarzchild metric, the
funnel's surface metric has a (removable) singularity at the finite distance
from the funnel's center and places the certain funnel's depth which we call
`gravitational length'. The gravitational length is analogous to the
gravitational radius and defines the equivalent of the black hole's mass in the
laboratory model. The mass equivalent corresponds to $\sim 0.367\cdot 10^{12}$
g for the funnel as deep as 5 cm. We define more precisely the inviscid shallow
water equations for the arbitrary bottom curvature. We show that in general

LHC through the Higgs portal in the gluon fusion and less so in gauge mediated

(SMBH), at R~1000 gravitational radii and are most frequently observed in the
nuclear spectra of low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and radio-galaxies. In the
present paper we argue that broad double-peaked profiles are present also in
the spectra of other Type 1 AGN, such as Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that
the inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) is also the outer part of the
accretion disk. We use the Palomar spectral survey of nearby galaxies to show
that the only difference between Seyfert 1 BLR line profiles and ""bona fide""
double peakers is that, in most cases, besides a disk component, we need an
additional Gaussian component attributed to non-disk clouds. The recognition
that the inner and most variable part of the BLR has a disk geometry suggests
that the factor 'f ' in the expression to obtain the SMBH mass (M) in Type 1
AGN M(SMBH)=f [R(BLR) (Delta V)^2]/G is f = 1/[sin^2(i)] for the disk dominated
sources. Our median inclination i=27 degrees implies f=4.5, very close to the
most recent value of f=4.3+/-1.05, obtained from independent studies. We derive
a relation between f and the FWHM of the broad profile that may help to reduce
the uncertainties in the SMBH mass determinations of AGN.

atoms on one sublattice of the graphene layer and suppress the migration of the
adsorbed hydrogen atoms. I also present the substrate effect of h-BN that
reduces distortion induced by fluorination of graphene and stabilizes
half-passivated graphene in a single sublattice. Then using spin-polarized
density functional calculations I investigate magnetic properties of graphone.
I show the system has different magnetic order which can be described by either
super-exchange or double exchange mechanisms depending on the type the of add
atom. The hybridization of graphene changes from $sp^2$- to $sp^3$- type
hybridization due to the buckling induced by passivation. The change in
hybridization together with add-atom orbitals induces a fairly large spin orbit
coupling (SOC). Based upon first principle spin-polarized density of states
calculations, I show that the graphone obtained in different graphene/h-BN
heterostructures exhibits a half metallic state. I propose to use this exotic
material for spin valve systems and other spintronics devices.

detection. Most of the recent improvements have been achieved by targeting
deeper feedforward networks. However, many hard object categories such as
bottle, remote, etc. require representation of fine details and not just
coarse, semantic representations. But most of these fine details are lost in
the early convolutional layers. What we need is a way to incorporate finer
details from lower layers into the detection architecture. Skip connections
have been proposed to combine high-level and low-level features, but we argue
that selecting the right features from low-level requires top-down contextual
information. Inspired by the human visual pathway, in this paper we propose
top-down modulations as a way to incorporate fine details into the detection
framework. Our approach supplements the standard bottom-up, feedforward ConvNet
with a top-down modulation (TDM) network, connected using lateral connections.
These connections are responsible for the modulation of lower layer filters,
and the top-down network handles the selection and integration of contextual

of multi-band photometry of the 21 YSGs. We find three luminous YSGs in our

enshrouded within extended, cold dusty envelopes. Our spectroscopy of star 2
shows emission of more than one H$\alpha$ component, as well as emission of
CaII, implying an extended atmospheric structure. In addition, the long-term
monitoring of the star reveals a dimming in the visual light curve of amplitude
larger than 0.5 mag that caused an apparent drop in the temperature that

the Galactic YHG $\rho$ Cas. Five less luminous YSGs are suggested as post-RSG

by Assef), it fails on two quasar populations: 1) hot-dust-deficient (HDD)
quasars that show very weak emission thoroughly from the near-IR to the far-IR,
and 2) warm-dust-deficient (WDD) quasars that have similar hot dust emission as
normal quasars but are relatively faint in the mid- and far-IR. After building
composite AGN templates for these dust-deficient quasars, we successfully fit
the 0.3-500 {\mu}m SEDs of the PG sample with the appropriate AGN template, an
infrared template of a star-forming galaxy, and a host galaxy stellar template.
20 HDD and 12 WDD quasars are identified from the SED decomposition, including
seven ambiguous cases. Compared with normal quasars, the HDD quasars have AGN
with relatively low Eddington ratios and the fraction of WDD quasars increases
with AGN luminosity. Moreover, both the HDD and WDD quasar populations show
relatively stronger mid-IR silicate emission. Virtually identical SED

holographic superconductor in AdS$_2$ and models the impurity screening. We
study the time dependence of the condensate induced by quenches of the Kondo

lowest-lying quasinormal mode of the dual gravity model. This mode also governs
the formation of the screening cloud, which is obtained as the decrease of

quasinormal mode is imaginary and the relaxation of the condensate is
over-damped. For quenches whose final state is close to the critical point of

star-formation histories. We find that galaxies with dynamical times longer
than 100 Myr have star formation rates less than $10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
and slowly enrich metals in their early phase. These galaxies can explain the
observed large scatters of r-process abundance in EMP stars in the Milky Way

merger appears at a higher metallicity in galaxies with a dynamical time
shorter than typical neutron star merger times. The scatters of r-process

normally dominated by Bloch state occupation number changes that are correlated
with group velocity and lead to a steady state current. However, for a number
of important physical observables, the most important response even in
conductors can be electric-field induced coherence between Bloch states in
different bands, such as that responsible for screening in dielectrics.
Examples include the anomalous and spin-Hall effects, spin torques, minimum
conductivities and the chiral anomaly. In this paper we present a general
quantum kinetic theory of linear response to an electric field which can be
applied to solids with arbitrarily complicated band structures and includes the
inter-band coherence response and the Bloch-state repopulation responses on an
equal footing. We aim to enable extensive transport theory applications using
computational packages based on maximally localized Wannier functions. The
formalism is based on density-matrix equations of motion, on a Born
approximation treatment of disorder, and on an expansion in scattering rate to
leading non-trivial order. The quasiparticle bands are treated in a completely
general manner that allows for arbitrary forms of the spin-orbit interaction
and for the broken time reversal symmetry of magnetic conductors. We
demonstrate that the inter-band response in conductors consists primarily of
two terms: an intrinsic contribution due to the entire Fermi sea that captures
the Berry curvature contribution to wave-packet dynamics, and an anomalous
contribution caused by scattering that is sensitive to the presence of the
Fermi surface. We solve for some electric-field response properties of simple
model systems that are known to be dominated by interband coherence
contributions and discuss an extensive list of complicated problems that cannot
be solved analytically.

to obtain much more detailed information for star-forming galaxies at
significantly lower redshift. Accordingly, studies of their far-UV spectra are
useful for understanding the factors modulating the strength of CIII] emission.
We present the first statistical sample of CIII] emission measurements in
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1. Our sample is drawn from the DEEP2 survey and
spans the redshift 0.64 < z < 1.35 (<z> = 1.08). We find that the median
equivalent width (EW) of individual CIII] detections in our sample (1.30 {\AA})

out of 184 galaxies with coverage of CIII], only 40 have significant

lower luminosities on average than those without, implying that strong CIII]
emitters are in general young and low-mass galaxies without significant dust

correlates with multiple galaxy properties (M_B, U-B, M*, star-formation rate,

stationary and moving sound clocks are perceived by observers on the other
chain as undergoing the relativistic phenomena of length contraction and time
dilation by the Lorentz factor, with c the speed of sound. Sound clocks within
moving chains actually tick less frequently than stationary ones and must be
separated by a shorter distance than when stationary to satisfy simultaneity
conditions. Stationary sound clocks appear to be length contracted and time
dilated to moving observers due to their misunderstanding of their own state of
motion with respect to the laboratory. Observers restricted to using sound
clocks describe a universe kinematically consistent with the theory of special
relativity, despite the preferred frame of their universe in the laboratory.
Such devices show promise in further probing analogue relativity models, for

a procedure that constructs effective theories of gravity by integrating out

manifest diffeomorphism invariance enables us to construct a fully

fixed-background and background-independent forms of the manifestly
diffeomorphism-invariant ERG. The second topic is cosmological backreaction,
which concerns the effect of averaging over high-frequency metric perturbations
to the gravitational field equations describing the universe at large scales.
This has been much studied the context of the unmodified form of General
Relativity, but has been much less studied in the context of higher-derivative
effective theories obtained by integrating out the high-energy modes of some
more fundamental (quantum) theory of gravity. The effective stress-energy
tensor for backreaction can be used directly as a diffeomorphism-invariant
effective stress-energy tensor for gravitational waves without specifying the
background metric.
  This thesis will construct the manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant ERG and
compute the effective action at the classical level in two different schemes.
We will then turn to cosmological backreaction in higher-derivative gravity,
deriving the general form of the effective stress-energy tensor due to
inhomogeneity for local diffeomorphism-invariant effective theories of gravity.
This an exciting research direction, as it begins the construction of a quantum
theory of gravity as well as investigating possible implications for cosmology.

black hole accretion discs. This work is expected to reveal how such phenomena
observed near the horizon depend on physical environment of the source

unfold correspondences between the dependence of accretion-related parameters

372 new and 260 previously published eclipse timings reveals a 13.6 year period
or quasi-period in the times of minimum light. The seasonal light curves show a
complex spectrum of periodic signals: both positive and negative superhumps,
likely arising from a prograde apsidal precession and a retrograde nodal
precession of the accretion disc. These signals appear most prominently and
famously as sidebands of the orbital frequency but the precession frequencies
themselves, at 0.40 and 0.22 cycles per day, are also seen directly in the
power spectrum. The superhumps are sometimes seen together and sometimes
separately. The depth, width and skew of eclipses are all modulated in phase
with both nodal and apsidal precession of the tilted and eccentric accretion
disc. The superhumps, or more correctly the precessional motions which produce
them, may be essential to understanding the mysterious SW Sextantis syndrome.
Disc wobble and eccentricity can both produce Doppler signatures inconsistent
with the true dynamical motions in the binary, and disc wobble might boost the
mass-transfer rate by enabling the hot white dwarf to directly irradiate the
secondary star.

formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant
progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies
and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic
abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is
to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since
observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic
presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and
accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological
simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been
shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large
variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They
capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating
galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we
focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the
underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar
medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires
accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely
describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently
unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations.
Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and
heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting
black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the
non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and
cosmic rays.

train a large Neural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a

because it outperformed traditional SMT approaches in several translation tasks
at WMT and other evaluation tasks/benchmarks at least for some language pairs.
However, many of the enhancements in SMT over the years have not been
incorporated into the NMT framework. In this paper, we focus on one such
enhancement namely domain adaptation. We propose an approach for adapting a NMT
system to a new domain. The main idea behind domain adaptation is that the
availability of large out-of-domain training data and a small in-domain
training data. We report significant gains with our proposed method in both
automatic metrics and a human subjective evaluation metric on two language
pairs. With our adaptation method, we show large improvement on the new domain
while the performance of our general domain only degrades slightly. In
addition, our approach is fast enough to adapt an already trained system to a
new domain within few hours without the need to retrain the NMT model on the
combined data which usually takes several days/weeks depending on the volume of

ergodicity or information stability is required, and where the uncertainty set
can be arbitrary. When the discrete noise is additive but otherwise arbitrary
and there is no cost constraint on the input, it is shown that the causal
feedback does not increase the capacity. This extends the earlier result
obtained for general single-state channels with full transmitter (Tx) channel
state information (CSI) to the compound setting. It is further shown that, for
this compound setting and under a mild technical condition on the additive
noise, the addition of the full Tx CSI does not increase the capacity either,
so that the worst-case and compound channel capacities are the same. This can
also be expressed as a saddle-point in the information-theoretic game between
the transmitter (who selects the input distribution) and the nature (who
selects the channel state), even though the objective function (the
inf-information rate) is not convex/concave in the right way. Cases where the
Tx CSI does increase the capacity are identified.
  Conditions under which the strong converse holds for this channel are
studied. The ergodic behaviour of the worst-case noise in otherwise
information-unstable channel is shown to be both sufficient and necessary for
the strong converse to hold, including feedback and no feedback cases.

effective repulsion that promotes cell dispersal, thereby hindering the

collective cell motion, ensures tensile intercellular stresses, and opposes
cell extrusion. Thus, our work highlights the prominent role of CIL in

previously to describe the classical scattering of solitons with integrable
defects of type I, to include the much larger and intricate collection of
finite-gap solutions defined in terms of generalised theta functions. In this
context, it is generally not feasible to adopt a direct approach, via ansatze
for the fields to either side of the defect tuned to satisfy the defect sewing
conditions. Rather, essential use is made of the fact that the defect sewing
conditions themselves are intimately related to Backlund transformations in
order to set up a strategy to enable the calculation of the field on one side
by suitably transforming the field on the other side. The method is implemented
using Darboux transformations and illustrated in detail for the sine-Gordon and
KdV models. An exception, treatable by both methods, indirect and direct, is
provided by the genus 1 solutions. These can be expressed in terms of Jacobi
elliptic functions, which satisfy a number of useful identities of relevance to
this problem. There are new features to the solutions obtained in the
finite-gap context but, in all cases, if a (multi)soliton limit is taken within
the finite-gap solutions previously known results are recovered.

exist. Johannes Kepler's name is attached to it, as he published a detailed
account of the observations made by himself and European colleagues. Supernova
1604 was very likely a Type Ia supernova, which exploded 350 pc to 750 pc above
the Galactic plane. Its supernova remnant, known as Kepler's supernova remnant,
shows clear evidence for interaction with nitrogen-rich material in the
north/northwest part of the remnant, which, given the height above the Galactic
plane, must find its origin in mass loss from the supernova progenitor system.
The combination of a Type Ia supernova and the presence of circumstellar
material makes Kepler's supernova remnant a unique object to study the origin
of Type Ia supernovae. The evidence suggests that the progenitor binary system
of supernova 1604 consisted of a carbon- oxygen white dwarf and an evolved
companion star, which most likely was in the (post) asymptotic giant branch of
its evolution. A problem with this scenario is that the companion star must
have survived the explosion, but no trace of its existence has yet been found,
despite a deep search.

allow exploration of the interplay between squeezing and displacement, which
can give rise to strong deviations from the Poissonian statistics. In
particular, we report on the periodic bunching in a Josephson junction formed
by two coupled exciton-polariton modes. Quantum modeling traces the bunching
back to the presence of quadrature squeezing. Our results, linking the light

pair-instability supernovae. However, their rise times are typically shorter
than those expected from pair-instability supernovae, and Type Ic superluminous
supernovae are often suggested to be powered by magnetar spin-down. If magnetar
spin-down is actually a major mechanism to power Type Ic superluminous
supernovae, it should be able to produce decline rates similar to the 56Co
decay rate rather easily. In this study, we investigate the conditions for
magnetars under which their spin-down energy input can behave like the 56Ni
nuclear decay energy input. We find that an initial magnetic field strength
within a certain range is sufficient to keep the magnetar energy deposition
within a factor of a few of the 56Co decay energy for several hundreds of days.
Magnetar spin-down needs to be by almost pure dipole radiation with the braking
index close to 3 to mimic 56Ni in a wide parameter range. Not only late-phase
56Co-decay-like light curves, but also rise time and peak luminosity of most
56Ni-powered light curves can be reproduced by magnetars. Bolometric light
curves for more than 700 days are required to distinguish the two energy
sources solely by them. We expect that more slowly-declining superluminous

through time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific
movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available
space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal
tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model
called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has
often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate
tracking data of animal movement are now becoming more common.
  2. We developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identifying behavioral
states from animal tracks with negligible error, which we called the Hidden
Markov Movement Model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the
process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and
the R package TMB for rapid model fitting.
  3. We compared the HMMM to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly
accurate tracks, the DCRWSnome, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted
with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable
for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout,
and blue shark, as well as to simulated data.
  4. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from
animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the
popular DCRWS implementation for highly accurate tracking data. It additionally
provides a groundwork for development of more complex modelling of animal
movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R

Superior region) from the Sudbury impact (1,849 +/- 0.3 Ma) event, have been
analyzed for their Cr isotope compositions. Our results suggest that 1) these
distal ejecta deposits are all of impact origin, 2) the Graenseso and Zaonega
spherule layers contain a distinct carbonaceous chondrite component, and are
possibly related to the same impact event, which could be Vredefort (2,023 +/-
4 Ma) or another not yet identified large impact event from that of similar

different from the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers, and could indicate
the impact of a heterogeneous chondritic body.

extension of the recently proposed, unified form of radiation to the ACV
reduced-action model and to its resummed-eikonal exchange. By superimposing
that radiation all-over eikonal scattering, we are able to derive the
corresponding (unitary) coherent-state operator. The resulting graviton
spectrum, tuned on the gravitational radius $R$, fully agrees with previous
calculations for small angles $\Theta_s\ll 1$ but, for sizeable angles
$\Theta_s(b)\leq \Theta_c = O(1)$ acquires an exponential cutoff of the large
$\omega R$ region, due to energy conservation, so as to emit a finite fraction
of the total energy. In the approach-to-collapse regime of $b\to b_c^+$ we find
a radiation enhancement due to large tidal forces, so that the whole energy is
radiated off, with a large multiplicity $\langle N \rangle\sim Gs \gg 1$ and a
well-defined frequency cutoff of order $R^{-1}$. The latter corresponds to the
Hawking temperature for a black hole of mass notably smaller than $\sqrt{s}$.

improves the detectability of change-points, and identify and describe an

at the source and propagate and accelerate outward for several orders of
magnitude in distance before they interact with the ambient medium. We find
that this interaction can trigger strong energy dissipation of two kinds inside
the jets, depending on the properties of the ambient medium. Those jets that
form in a new outburst and drill a fresh hole through the ambient medium fall
victim to a 3D magnetic kink instability and dissipate their energy primarily
through magnetic reconnection in the current sheets formed by the instability.
On the other hand, those jets that form during repeated cycles of AGN activity
and escape through a pre-existing hole in the ambient medium maintain their
stability and dissipate their energy primarily at MHD recollimation shocks. In
both cases the dissipation region can be associated with a change in the
density profile of the ambient gas. The Bondi radius in AGN jets serves as such
a location.

family of link functions in binomial response models dealing with model

response models with a single link function. Several forms of link function
have been proposed to fit dose response models to estimate the BMD and the
corresponding benchmark dose lower bound (BMDL). However, if the assumed link
is not correct, then the estimated BMD and BMDL from the fitted model may not
be accurate. To account for model uncertainty, model averaging (MA) methods are
proposed to estimate BMD averaging over a model space containing a finite
number of standard models. Usual model averaging focuses on a pre-specified
list of parametric models leading to pitfalls when none of the models in the
list is the correct model. Here, an alternative which augments an initial list
of parametric models with an infinite number of additional models having
varying links has been proposed. In addition, different methods for estimating
BMDL based on the family of link functions are derived. The proposed approach
is compared with MA in a simulation study and applied to a real data set.
Simulation studies are also conducted to compare the four methods of estimating

symmetric charged black hole accreting neutral null fluid. Previous study by
Marolf and Ori suggested that late infalling observers encounter an effective
shock wave as they approach the outgoing portion of the inner horizon.
Non-linear perturbations could generate an effective gravitational shock wave,
which manifests as a drop of the area coordinate $r$ from inner horizon value
$r_{-}$ towards zero in an extremely short proper time duration of the
infalling observer. We consider three different scenarios: a) A charged black
hole accreting a single (ingoing) null fluid; b) a charged black hole perturbed
by two null fluids, ingoing and outgoing; c) a charged black hole perturbed by
an ingoing null fluid and a self-gravitating scalar field. While we do not
observe any evidence for a gravitational shock in the first case, we detect the
shock in the other two, using ingoing timelike and null geodesics. The shock
width $\Delta\tau$ decreases rapidly with a fairly good match to a new,
generalized exponential law, $\Delta\tau\sim e^{-\intop\kappa_{-}
(\widetilde{V}_{f})d\widetilde{V}_{f}}$, where $\widetilde{V}_{f}$ is a
specific timing parameter for the ingoing timelike geodesics and
$\kappa_{-}(\widetilde{V}_{f})$ is a generalized (Reissner-Nordstr\""om like)
surface gravity of the charged black hole at the inner horizon. We also gain
new insight into the inner (classical) structure of a charged black hole
perturbed by two null fluids, including strong evidence for the existence of a
spacelike $r=0$ singularity. We use a finite-difference numerical code with
double-null coordinates combined with an adaptive gauge method in order to
solve the field equations from the region outside the black hole down to the
vicinity of the $r=0$ singularity.

using blocks of representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ over a field $\textbf{k}$
of characteristic $p$ with zero Frobenius character, and singular
Harish-Chandra character. We show that the aforementioned categorification
admits a Koszul graded lift, which is equivalent to a geometric
categorification constructed by Cautis, Kamnitzer, and Licata using coherent
sheaves on cotangent bundles to Grassmanians. In particular, the latter admits
an abelian refinement. With respect to this abelian refinement, the stratified
Mukai flop induces a perverse equivalence on the derived categories for
complementary Grassmanians. This is part of a larger project to give a
combinatorial approach to Lusztig's conjectures for representations of Lie
algebras in positive characteristic.

dimer molecules have enabled the production of gases of ultracold molecules
that are not chemically reactive. It has been presumed in the literature that
in the absence of an electric field the low-energy scattering of such
nonreactive molecules (NRMs) will be similar to atoms, in which a single
$s$-wave scattering length governs the collisional physics. However, in Ref.
[1], it was argued that the short-range collisional physics of NRMs is much
more complex than for atoms, and that this leads to a many-body description in
terms of a multi-channel Hubbard model. In this work, we show that this
multi-channel Hubbard model description of NRMs in an optical lattice is robust
against the approximations employed in Ref. [1] to estimate its parameters. We
do so via an exact, albeit formal, derivation of a multi-channel resonance
model for two NRMs from an ab initio description of the molecules in terms of
their constituent atoms. We discuss the regularization of this two-body
multi-channel resonance model in the presence of a harmonic trap, and how its
solutions form the basis for the many-body model of Ref. [1]. We also
generalize the derivation of the effective lattice model to include multiple
internal states (e.g., rotational or hyperfine). We end with an outlook to
future research.

sample of a stochastic dataset in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point is sampled
independently with its existence probability is dominance-free. In fact, we
investigate a colored generalization of the problem, in which the points in the
given stochastic dataset are colored and we are interested in the random
samples that are inter-color dominance-free (i.e., any two points with
different colors do not dominate each other). We propose the first algorithm
that solves the problem for $d=2$ in near-quadratic time. On the other hand, we
show that the problem is #P-hard for any $d \geq 3$, even if the points have a
restricted color pattern; this implies the #P-hardness of the uncolored version
(i.e., computing the dominance-free probability of a uncolored stochastic
dataset) for $d \geq 3$. In addition, we show that even when the existence
probabilities of the points are all equal to 0.5, the problem remains #P-hard

subsets for $d \geq 7$. In order to prove our hardness results, we establish
some results about embedding the vertices a graph into low-dimensional
Euclidean space such that two vertices are connected by an edge in the graph
iff they form a dominance pair in the embedding. These results may be of

under secrecy considerations. We focus on a NOMA system where a transmitter
sends confidential messages to multiple users in the presence of an external
eavesdropper. The optimal designs of decoding order, transmission rates, and
power allocated to each user are investigated. Considering the practical
passive eavesdropping scenario where the instantaneous channel state of the
eavesdropper is unknown, we adopt the secrecy outage probability as the secrecy
metric. We first consider the problem of minimizing the transmit power subject
to the secrecy outage and quality of service constraints, and derive the
closed-form solution to this problem. We then explore the problem of maximizing
the minimum confidential information rate among users subject to the secrecy
outage and transmit power constraints, and provide an iterative algorithm to
solve this problem. We find that the secrecy outage constraint in the studied
problems does not change the optimal decoding order for NOMA, and one should
increase the power allocated to the user whose channel is relatively bad when
the secrecy constraint becomes more stringent. Finally, we show the advantage
of NOMA over orthogonal multiple access in the studied problems both
analytically and numerically.

two classes of traveling salesman problems. The algorithm shares main features
of the famous Max-Min Ant System with iteration-best reinforcement.
  For simple instances that have a $\{1,n\}$-valued distance function and a
unique optimal solution, we prove a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$
with the vertex-based random solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of
$O(n^{3+\epsilon}\ln n)$ with the edge-based random solution generation for an
arbitrary $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. These runtimes are very close to the known
expected runtime for variants of Max-Min Ant System with best-so-far
reinforcement. They are obtained for the stronger notion of stochastic runtime,
which means that an optimal solution is obtained in that time with an
overwhelming probability, i.e., a probability tending exponentially fast to one
with growing problem size.
  We also inspect more complex instances with $n$ vertices positioned on an
$m\times m$ grid. When the $n$ vertices span a convex polygon, we obtain a
stochastic runtime of $O(n^{3}m^{5+\epsilon})$ with the vertex-based random
solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{2}m^{5+\epsilon})$ for
the edge-based random solution generation. When there are $k = O(1)$ many
vertices inside a convex polygon spanned by the other $n-k$ vertices, we obtain
a stochastic runtime of $O(n^{4}m^{5+\epsilon}+n^{6k-1}m^{\epsilon})$ with the
vertex-based random solution generation, and a stochastic runtime of
$O(n^{3}m^{5+\epsilon}+n^{3k}m^{\epsilon})$ with the edge-based random solution
generation. These runtimes are better than the expected runtime for the
so-called $(\mu\!+\!\lambda)$ EA reported in a recent article, and again
obtained for the stronger notion of stochastic runtime.

ties at random or using average rank introduce independence into the data and,
hence, lead to biased estimation. We propose an estimation method that treats
the ranks of tied data as being interval censored and maximizes a
pseudo-likelihood based on interval censored pseudo-observations. A parametric
bootstrap procedure that preserves the observed tied ranks in the data is
adapted to assess the estimation uncertainty and perform goodness-of-fit tests.

(SL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving multi-dimensional linear
transport equations. The methods rely on a characteristic Galerkin weak
formulation, leading to $L^2$ stable discretizations for linear problems.
Unlike many existing SL methods, the high order accuracy and mass conservation
of the proposed methods are realized in a non-splitting manner. Thus, the
detrimental splitting error, which is known to significantly contaminate long
term transport simulations, will be not incurred. One key ingredient in the
scheme formulation, borrowed from CSLAM [Lauritzen, Nair, and Ullrich, 2010],
is the use of Green's theorem which allows us to convert volume integrals into
a set of line integrals. The resulting line integrals are much easier to
approximate with high order accuracy, hence facilitating the implementation.
Another novel ingredient is the construction of quadratic curves in
approximating sides of upstream cell, leading to quadratic-curved quadrilateral
upstream cells. Formal third order accuracy is obtained by such a construction.
The desired positivity-preserving property is further attained by incorporating
a high order bound-preserving filter. To assess the performance of the proposed
methods, we test and compare the numerical schemes with a variety of
configurations for solving several benchmark transport problems with both
smooth and nonsmooth solutions. The efficiency and efficacy are numerically
verified.

remarkably different radial distribution of refractory dust particles by
hypothesizing that the majority of the dust originates directly from the

40 times greater than the constant speed sublimation model discussed by
Protopapa et al. but is still too small to explain the hyperactivity of the

dislodged in the filament source regions must be in weakly accelerated large

These chunks soon leave the filamentary jet structure due to the rotation of

thick molecular torus component hiding the broad emission line region. Assuming
the presence of a thick neutral component in the molecular torus characterized
by a \ion{H}{I} column density > $10^{22}{\rm\ cm^{-2}}$, we propose that far
UV radiation around Ly$\alpha$ can be significantly polarized through Rayleigh
scattering. Adopting a Monte Carlo technique we compute polarization of
Rayleigh scattered radiation near Ly$\alpha$ in a thick neutral region in the
shape of a slab and a cylindrical shell. It is found that radiation near
Ly$\alpha$ Rayleigh reflected from a very thick slab can be significantly
polarized in a fairly large range of wavelength $\Delta\lambda\sim 50$ \AA\
exhibiting a flux profile similar to the incident one. Rayleigh transmitted
radiation in a slab is characterized by the central dip with a complicated
polarization behavior. The optically thick part near Ly$\alpha$ center is
polarized in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal, which is in
contrast to weakly polarized wing parts in the direction parallel to the slab
normal. A similar polarization flip phenomenon is also found in the case of a
tall cylindrical shell, in which the spatial diffusion along the vertical
direction near the inner cylinder wall for core photons leads to a tendency of
the electric field aligned to the direction perpendicular to the vertical axis.
Observational implications are briefly discussed including spectropolarimetry
of the quasar PG~1630+377 by Koratkar et al. in 1990 where Ly$\alpha$ is
strongly polarized with no other emission lines polarized.

improves the sampling efficiency. With numerical examples we demonstrate that

international collaboration which works towards standardising the extraction of
image biomarkers from acquired imaging for the purpose of high-throughput
quantitative image analysis (radiomics). Lack of reproducibility and validation
of high-throughput quantitative image analysis studies is considered to be a
major challenge for the field. Part of this challenge lies in the scantiness of
consensus-based guidelines and definitions for the process of translating
acquired imaging into high-throughput image biomarkers. The IBSI therefore
seeks to provide image biomarker nomenclature and definitions, benchmark data
sets, and benchmark values to verify image processing and image biomarker
calculations, as well as reporting guidelines, for high-throughput image
analysis.

them are corrected for detector resolution and acceptance effects back to the
parton and stable-particle levels. The measured values of the observables at
parton level are compared to Standard Model predictions at next-to-leading

presented and the means of the distributions are compared to Monte Carlo
predictions. No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed for
any observable.

owing to its broken inversion symmetry and linear energy dispersion which are

proportional to the helicity of the incident light and reverses its direction
on changing the radiation helicity from left handed to right handed, a
periodical oscillation therefore appears following with the alteration of
optical polarization. We herein attribute the CPGE to the asymmetric optical

The response of the granular assembly is modelled through the discrete element
method (DEM), consistent with a micro-macro homogenization scheme formulated in
the transition from a continuous to a discrete setting. The three classical
types of boundary conditions (displacement, periodic and displacement) are
implemented with a servo-control method. Two types of algorithms are developed,
which consider or not an initial prediction for the displacement field of the
particles. Additionally, to simulate in a more realistic manner the effect of
macroscopic deformation on the micro-structure, a mixed type of boundary
conditions is introduced, i.e. a combination of classical boundary conditions.
The effectiveness of the algorithms is tested on a series of DEM simulations.
The influence of the micro-structural morphology and of the size of the
micro-structure on the overall response is finally investigated.

observables delivered by the two methods are in principle highly complementary,
no attempt has ever been made to combine them, perhaps due to the different

present the first combined analysis of previously-published dayside spectra of
the exoplanet HD 209458b obtained at low resolution with HST/WFC3 and
Spitzer/IRAC, and at high resolution with VLT/CRIRES. By utilizing a novel
retrieval algorithm capable of computing the joint probability distribution of
low- and high-resolution spectra, we obtain tight constraints on the chemical
composition of the planet's atmosphere. In contrast to the WFC3 data, we do not
confidently detect H2O at high spectral resolution. The retrieved water
abundance from the combined analysis deviates by 1.9 sigma from the
expectations for a solar-composition atmosphere in chemical equilibrium.
Measured relative molecular abundances of CO and H2O strongly favor an
oxygen-rich atmosphere (C/O<1 at 3.5 sigma) for the planet when compared to
equilibrium calculations including O rainout. From the abundances of the seven
molecular species included in this study we constrain the planet metallicity to
0.1-1.0x the stellar value (1 sigma). This study opens the way to coordinated
exoplanet surveys between the flagship ground- and space-based facilities,

report on the results obtained when modifying the reflector surrounding the
fission core, by replacing pure lead with a layered graphite/lead structure. We
found that, by appropriately choosing position and thickness of the graphite
and lead layers, it is possible to obtain a hybrid system where the neutron
spectrum in the core still exhibits a fast character, while the spectrum in the
graphite layer is considerably softer, becoming thermal in the most peripheral
positions. In order to obtain such a modulation of the neutron spectra from the
center of the system to the periphery, a careful choice of the materials has to
be made in order to avoid large variations of the local power at the core
boundary. However, the smoothness of the power distribution is obtained at the
expense of lower values of keff and the total power of the system. In the
second part of the paper, we explored the option of adopting light water as
coolant, instead of the helium gas assumed in the initial design. We found that
this produces an increase in keff and thermal power, without significantly
perturbing the fast character of the system and without introducing spatial
power excursions in any place within the core. The characteristics obtained may
allow to design a system where fast, mixed and thermal spectra can be used to
expand the use of the ADS as an irradiation facility.

alternating inverse spin Hall voltages in the normal metal. In the
long-wavelength limit, including long-range dipole interactions, the ratio of
the enhancement for transverse volume modes to that of the macrospin mode is
equal to two. With an out-of-plane magnetization, this ratio decreases with
both an increasing surface anisotropic energy and mode number. If the surface
anisotropy induces a surface state, the enhancement can be an order of
magnitude larger than for to the macrospin. With an in-plane magnetization, the
induced dissipation enhancement can be understood by mapping the anisotropy
parameter to the out-of-plane case with anisotropy. For shorter wavelengths, we
compute the enhancement numerically and find good agreement with the analytical
results in the applicable limits. We also compute the induced direct- and
alternating-current inverse spin Hall voltages and relate these to the magnetic
energy stored in the ferromagnet. Because the magnitude of the direct spin Hall
voltage is a measure of spin dissipation, it is directly proportional to the
enhancement of Gilbert damping. The alternating spin Hall voltage exhibits a
similar in-plane wave-number dependence, and we demonstrate that it is greatest

medium dependent change of the nuclear masses in a generalized relativistic
density functional approach and the excluded-volume mechanism in a statistical
model. Both approaches use the same description for the interaction between the
nucleons. The composition of neutron star matter, in particular the occurrence
of light and heavy nuclei, and its thermodynamic properties are studied.

description on the Bloch sphere. With this geometric approach, we find that
modular and weak values of observables of N-level quantum systems can be
factored in N-1 contributions. Their modulus is determined by the product of
N-1 ratios involving projection probabilities between qubits, while their
argument is deduced from a sum of N-1 solid angles on the Bloch sphere. These
theoretical results allow us to study the geometric origin of the quantum phase
discontinuity around singularities of weak values in three-level systems. We
also analyze the three-box paradox [1] from the point of view of a bipartite

comes to opposite conclusions about the entanglement state of the particles

quantum tunneling of atoms in the reaction between CH4 and OH. The importance
of this reaction pathway is derived by investigating isotope substituted
analogs. Quantitative reaction rates needed for astrochemical models at low
temperature are currently unavailable both in the solid state and in the gas
phase. Here, we study tunneling effects upon hydrogen abstraction in CH4 + OH
by focusing on two reactions: CH4 + OD -> CH3 + HDO and CD4 + OH -> CD3 + HDO.
The experimental study shows that the solid-state reaction rate R(CH4 + OD) is
higher than R(CD4 + OH) at 15 K. Experimental results are accompanied by
calculations of the corresponding unimolecular and bimolecular reaction rate
constants using instanton theory taking into account surface effects. From the
work presented here, the unimolecular reactions are particularly interesting as
these provide insight into reactions following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood process.
The resulting ratio of the rate constants shows that the H abstraction (k(CH4 +
OD)) is approximately ten times faster than D-abstraction (k(CD4 + OH)) at 65
K. We conclude that tunneling is involved at low temperatures in the
abstraction reactions studied here. The unimolecular rate constants can be used
by the modeling community as a first approach to describe OH-mediated
abstraction reactions in the solid phase. For this reason we provide fits of
our calculated rate constants that allow the inclusion of these reactions in
models in a straightforward fashion.

questions online, at any time and from anywhere, which effectively lowers the
cost of health care. The most common approach is using online health expert
question-answering (HQA) services, as health consumers are more willing to
trust answers from professional physicians. However, these answers can be of
varying quality depending on circumstance. In addition, as the available HQA
services grow, how to predict the answer quality of HQA services via machine
learning becomes increasingly important and challenging. In an HQA service,
answers are normally short texts, which are severely affected by the data
sparsity problem. Furthermore, HQA services lack community features such as
best answer and user votes. Therefore, the wisdom of the crowd is not available
to rate answer quality. To address these problems, in this paper, the
prediction of HQA answer quality is defined as a classification task. First,
based on the characteristics of HQA services and feedback from medical experts,
a standard for HQA service answer quality evaluation is defined. Next, based on
the characteristics of HQA services, several novel non-textual features are
proposed, including surface linguistic features and social features. Finally, a
deep belief network (DBN)-based HQA answer quality prediction framework is
proposed to predict the quality of answers by learning the high-level hidden
semantic representation from the physicians' answers. Our results prove that
the proposed framework overcomes the problem of overly sparse textual features
in short text answers and effectively identifies high-quality answers.

ground level enhancement analysis and newly numerically computed yield
functions for conversion of secondary particle fluence to effective dose and/or

solar energetic particle spectra (SEPs) is the basis of the model. Since SEPs
possess an essential isotropic part, specifically during the event onset, the
angular characteristics should be also derived with good precision. This can be
achieved using neutron monitor data during a special class of SEP events the
ground level enhancements (GLEs). On the basis of the method representing a
sequence of consecutive steps: computation of the NM asymptotic cones, NM
rigidity cut-off and application of convenient optimization procedure, we
derive the rigidity spectra and anisotropy characteristics of GLE particles.
For the computation we use newly computed yield function of the standard
sea-level 6NM64 neutron monitor for primary proton and alpha CR nuclei as well
as 6NM64 yield function at altitudes ranging from the sea level up to 5000 m
above the sea level. We derive the SEP spectra and pitch angle distributions in
their dynamical development throughout the event. Subsequently on the basis of
the derived spectra and angular characteristics and previously computed yield
functions we calculate the effective dose and/or ambient dose equivalent during
the GLE. Several examples are shown.

their bandwidth, with backscattering reflections (with Bragg angles $\approx$
90$^\circ$) providing the highest energy resolution along with high photon
collection efficiency. The crystal lattices of all these materials share the

a low density of unique backscattering Bragg reflections per unit photon energy

X-ray energy must be tuned to a specific electronic or nuclear transition. As a

properties of samples drawn from alternative theories and $\Lambda$CDM and
compare them to actual observations of the LG mass, velocity and position. As a
consequence of the additional pull, pairwise tangential and radial velocities
are enhanced in modified gravity and coupled dark energy with respect to
$\Lambda$CDM, inducing significant changes to the total angular momentum and
energy of the LG. For example, in models such as $f(R)$ and the symmetron this
increase can be as large as $60\%$, peaking well outside of the $95\%$

YSO candidates in total, 11 of which have been definitely identified with giant
stars unrelated to Lupus. The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona
fide YSOs, which represent more than 90% of the whole class~II and transition
disc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously
and self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and
its relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc,
increases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,
similar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a
significant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always
lower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to
observational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs. The
logMacc-logMstar correlation shows a statistically significant evidence of a
break, with a steeper relation for Mstar<0.2Msun and a flatter slope for higher
masses. The bimodality of the Macc-Mstar relation is confirmed with four
different evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal
behaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling
self-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other
processes, such as photo evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's
lifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on
the stellar mass. We also refined the empirical Lacc vs. Lline relationships.

the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting,
the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at
least one particle reaches a next-level state, that is, a state where the cost
decreases by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation
on states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov
function and an optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly
generated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological
equivalence relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically
evaluating its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm
resulted from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking
policy that optimizes energy conservation, clear view, and velocity alignment.
That is, we were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a
flock from an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected
V-formation. For flocks with 7 birds, ARES is able to generate a plan that
leads to a V-formation in 95% of the 8,000 random initial configurations within
63 seconds, on average. ARES can also be easily customized into a
model-predictive controller (MPC) with an adaptive receding horizon and
statistical guarantees of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our
adaptive-sizing approach is the first to provide convergence guarantees in
receding-horizon techniques.

We think that the same goals can be fulfilled using a simpler approach, where
the core of the backbone only implements many a priori computed paths, and most
adaptation to traffic engineering goals only takes place at the edge of the
network. In the vein of Software Defined Networking, edge adaptation should be
driven by a logically centralized controller that leverages the available paths
to adapt traffic load balancing to the current demands and network status. In
this article we present two algorithms to help building this vision. The first
one selects sets of paths able to support future load balancing needs and
adaptation to network faults. As the total number of required paths is very
important, and their continuous availability requires many FIB entries in core
routers, we also present a second algorithm that aggregates these paths in a
reduced number of trees. This second algorithm achieves better results than
previously proposed algorithms for path aggregation. To conclude, we show that
off-the-shelf equipment supporting simple protocols may be used to implement
routing with these trees, what shows that simplicity in the core can be
achieved by using only trivially available proto- cols and their most common

Fornacis. Our main aim is in pointing out the biases in the results due to not
accounting for some sources of uncertainty. We adopt the SCEPtER pipeline,
relying on stellar models computed with two stellar evolutionary codes (FRANEC
and MESA). We found multiple independent groups of solutions. The best one
suggests a system of age 1.10 $\pm$ 0.07 Gyr (primary star in the central
helium burning stage, secondary in the sub-giant branch), with a
helium-to-metal enrichment ratio of $\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 1$ and core
overshooting parameter $\beta = 0.15 \pm 0.01$ (FRANEC) and $f_{\rm ov}= 0.013
\pm 0.001 $ (MESA). The second class of solutions, characterised by a worse
goodness-of-fit, still suggest a primary star in the central helium-burning
stage but a secondary in the overall contraction phase, at the end of the main
sequence. The FRANEC grid provides an age of $1.16_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ Gyr and
$\beta = 0.25_{-0.01}^{+0.005}$, while the MESA grid gives $1.23 \pm 0.03$ Gyr
and $f_{\rm ov} = 0.025 \pm 0.003$. We also show that very precise mass
determinations with uncertainty of a few thousandths of solar mass are required
to obtain reliable determinations of stellar parameters, as mass errors larger
than approximately 1% lead to estimates that are not only less precise but also
biased. Moreover, we show that a fit obtained with a grid of models computed at
a fixed $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ can provide biased age and overshooting estimates.
The possibility of independent overshooting efficiencies for the two stars of
the system is also explored. This work confirms that to constrain the core
overshooting parameter by means of binary systems is a very difficult task that
requires an observational precision still rarely achieved and robust
statistical methods.

an asymmetric $\ell_1$ regularizer, setting some of the portfolio weights to
zero and keeping the out of sample estimator for the variance bounded, avoiding
the divergence present in the non-regularized case. However, the
susceptibility, i.e. the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio weights to
changes in the returns, diverges at a critical value $r=2$. This means that a
ban on short positions does not prevent the phase transition in the
optimization problem, it merely shifts the critical point from its
non-regularized value of $r=1$ to $2$. At $r=2$ the out of sample estimator for
the portfolio variance stays finite and the estimated in-sample variance
vanishes. We have performed numerical simulations to support the analytic
results and found perfect agreement for $N/T<2$. Numerical experiments on
finite size samples of symmetrically distributed returns show that above this
critical point the probability of finding solutions with zero in-sample
variance increases rapidly with increasing $N$, becoming one in the large $N$
limit. However, these are not legitimate solutions of the optimization problem,
as they are infinitely sensitive to any change in the input parameters, in
particular they will wildly fluctuate from sample to sample. We also calculate
the distribution of the optimal weights over the random samples and show that
the regularizer preferentially removes the assets with large variances, in
accord with one's natural expectation.

  Pseudo Marginal Methods",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article addresses the problem of efficient Bayesian inference in dynamic
systems using particle methods and makes a number of contributions. First, we
develop a correlated pseudo-marginal (CPM) approach for Bayesian inference in
state space (SS) models that is based on filtering the disturbances, rather
than the states. This approach is useful when the state transition density is
intractable or inefficient to compute, and also when the dimension of the
disturbance is lower than the dimension of the state. Second, we propose a
block pseudo-marginal (BPM) method that uses as the estimate of the likelihood
the average of G independent unbiased estimates of the likelihood. We associate
a set of underlying uniform of standard normal random numbers used to construct
each of the individual unbiased likelihood estimates and then use
component-wise Markov Chain Monte Carlo to update the parameter vector jointly
with one set of these random numbers at a time. This induces a correlation of
approximately 1-1/G between the logs of the estimated likelihood at the
proposed and current values of the model parameters. Third, we show for some
non-stationary state space models that the BPM approach is much more efficient
than the CPM approach, because it is difficult to translate the high
correlation in the underlying random numbers to high correlation between the
logs of the likelihood estimates. Although our focus has been on applying the
BPM method to state space models, our results and approach can be used in a
wide range of applications of the PM method, such as panel data models,
subsampling problems and approximate Bayesian computation.

Index, on network graphs. A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse.
But the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is
edge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes
in the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully
connected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations,
primarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its
definition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity
of a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it
sparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling,
Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are
commonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison
between edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate
examples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been
shown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing
graph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index
decreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between
the sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a
distribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide
variety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed
index together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network
graph.

for inflationary model building in Jordan frame supergravity. In this
framework, canonical kinetic terms in the Jordan frame result in the separation
of the Jordan frame scalar potential into a tree-level term and a supergravity
contribution, which is potentially dangerous for sustaining inflation. We show
that if the vacuum energy necessary for driving inflation originates dominantly
from the F-term of an auxiliary field (i.e. not the inflaton), the supergravity
corrections to the Jordan frame scalar potential are generically suppressed.
Moreover, these supergravity contributions identically vanish if the
superpotential $W$ vanishes along the inflationary trajectory. On the other
hand, if the F-term associated with the inflaton dominates the vacuum energy,
the supergravity contributions are generically comparable to the globally
supersymmetric contributions. In addition, the non-minimal coupling to gravity
inherent to Jordan frame supergravity significantly impacts the inflationary
model depending on the size and sign of this coupling. We discuss the
phenomenology of some representative inflationary models, and point out the
relation to the recently much discussed cosmological `attractor' models.

[1]. From one hand, it has the drawbacks of: (i) the expectation value of its
energy is infinite, (ii) it produces an ultraviolet catastrophe of the noise
power spectral density and, (iii) it lacks of an experimental validation under
thermal equilibrium conditions. From another hand, by imposing appropriate
boundary conditions and eliminating divergences by regulation techniques,
vacuum fluctuations are the source of an attractive force between opposite
conducting plates, firstly predicted by Casimir in 1948 [2] and later validated
experimentally with increasing accuracy. As a consequence, a quantum
formulation of FDT should account for the presence of the Casimir force and of
its consequences. In this letter we show that at thermal equilibrium the
Casimir force should be balanced by the mechanical reaction of the physical
system. As a consequence, no zero-point spectrum can be detected and the power
spectrum emitted by the physical system is the same of that calculated by
Planck in 1901 [3] for a black-body. Accordingly, the experimental validation
of the standard expression of the quantum FDT [1] is prevented in favor of the
Nyquist expression that includes the Planck factor [4].

relation between thermopower S and electrical conductivity {\sigma} of the
nanowires is found, with the magnetic field as an implicit variable. Combining
the linear behavior of the S vs. {\sigma} and the Mott formula, the energy

nanowire materials parameters from the measured thermopower, a simple model
based on the Mott formula is employed to distinguish the individual thermopower

contributions of the nanowire can be neglected, it was found that the magnetic

not only related to the electron density and the critical magnetic field, but
also to the degrees of freedom of electrons. The T_C values calculated from
this formula are in good agreement with the experimental results for most

holographically compute the vacuum decay rate of the Schwinger effect in this

could be identified as the $\theta$ angle or chiral potential in QCD. Under the
strong electromagnetic fields, the instability appears due to the creation of
quark-antiquark pairs and the associated decay rate can be obtained by
evaluating the imaginary part of the effective Euler-Heisenberg action which is
identified as the action of the probe brane with a constant electromagnetic
field. In the bubble D0-D4 configuration, we find the decay rate decreases when
the $\theta$ angle increases since the vacuum becomes heavier in the present of
the glue condensate in this system. And the decay rate matches to the result in
the black D0-D4 configuration at zero temperature limit according to our
calculations. In this sense, the Hawking-Page transition of this model could be
consistently interpreted as the confined/deconfined phase transition.
Additionally there is another instability from the D0-brane itself in this

triggered by the $\theta$ angle as it is known in the $\theta$-dependent QCD.

doping and the electrochemical capacity becomes constant over repeated cycling.
The critical doping $y \sim 0.16$ results in breakdown of the network of
cooperative/coherent normal-mode distortions; this leads to vanishing of the
first-order transition, establishment of hopping channels with lower
resistance, and enhancing lithiation and delithiation of the battery, thereby

in superconductivity of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) was developed
on the basis of four idealized assumptions: (1) only a small number of
electrons(or holes) are involved in superconductivity, and its density is
n{\delta}^2; (2) magnetic interactions between electron spins lead to
superconductivity; (3) there are different electronic states, i.e., the on-site
doubly-occupied electrons forming anti-ferromagnetic insulator states, the
off-site doubly-occupied electrons forming superconducting states, the
singly-occupied (spin up or down) electrons forming normal states and the empty
states; (4) the average kinetic energy of electrons (or holes) complies with
the equipartition theorem of energy. Based on these assumptions, an approximate
effective Hamiltonian was suggested. A parabolic relation between T_C and the
doping concentration {\delta} was found and thus the phase diagram for HTSC has
been explained. It was also found that, T_C is related to the
anti-ferromagnetic interaction energy J (or critical magnetic field B_C) and
the degrees of freedom of electrons i. The T_C values are thus calculated from
this theory to be 92.8K for YBa2Cu3O6.15, 40.3K for La2CuO4, and 58K for
SmOFeAs, which are in good agreement with the experimental results of 92K, 40K,

than that in the bulk, and T_C for SmOFeAs can be up to 116K.

interesting to speculate about subtle effects that could be analyzed using
upcoming generations of detectors. One such effect that has great potential for
revealing the properties of very dense matter is fluid oscillations of neutron
stars. These have been found in numerical simulations of the hypermassive
remnants of double neutron star mergers and of highly eccentric neutron star
orbits. Here we focus on the latter and sketch out some ideas for the
production, gravitational-wave detection, and analysis of neutron star
oscillations. These events will be rare (perhaps up to several tens per year
could be detected using third-generation detectors such as the Einstein
Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer), but they would have unique diagnostic power
for the analysis of cold, catalyzed, dense matter. Furthermore, these systems
are unusual in that analysis of the tidally excited f-modes of the stars could
yield simultaneous measurements of their masses, moments of inertia, and tidal
Love numbers, using the frequency, damping time, and amplitude of the modes.
They would thus present a nearly unique opportunity to test observationally the
I-Love-Q relation. The analysis of such events will require significant further
work in nuclear physics and general relativistic nonlinear mode coupling, and
thus we discuss further directions that will need to be pursued. For example,
we note that for nearly-grazing encounters, numerical simulations show that the
energy delivered to the f-modes may be up to two orders of magnitude greater
than predicted in the linear theory.

entangled and highly bunched. The conversion can be made reflectionless

GLEs was observed. In addition, there were several Forbush decreases, which led
to a suppression of galactic cosmic ray flux. As a consequence the cosmic ray
induced ion production in the atmosphere and the corresponding ionization
effect were subject of dynamical changes. Here we compute the complex ion
production due to cosmic rays during the Halloween sequence of ground level
enhancements on October-November 2003 and we estimate the ionization effect.
The spectral and angular characteristics of the solar protons are explicitly
considered throughout the events as well their time evolution. The ionization
effect during the period is computed at several altitudes above the sea level
in a region with $R_{c}$ $\le$ 1 GV and $R_{c}$ $\le$ 2 GV.

$\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $E$. Based on the irreducibility of

Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass detonations, and
double-degenerate mergers, and compare them with data. We show that in the PC

sum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally
quantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain
function? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated
information have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization
and Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these
approaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal
in this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated
information is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
multivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding
factorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum
information partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for
large networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated
information for both, the system's attractor states, as well as non-stationary
dynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks
to compute the integrated information for the human brain's connectome.
Compared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of
the brain generates greater information complexity.

the generalised Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory of Andrews & McIntyre (1978). This
theory relies on particle-following averaging to incorporate the constraints
imposed by the material conservations. It relies implicitly on an Euclidean
structure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic
interpretation and suffers from undesirable features, including the divergence
of the Lagrangian-mean velocity for incompressible fluids. Motivated by this,
we develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that we formulate intrinsically.
The theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; it also establishes a
clear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency
and those that depend on particular choices. We show that the Lagrangian mean
momentum -- the average of the pull-back of the momentum one-form -- obeys a
simple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's circulation,
irrespective of the mean-flow definition. We discuss four possible definitions
of the mean flow: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on
optimal transportation, a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group
of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and the glm definition proposed by Soward
& Roberts (2010). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations, we carry out
order-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean flow
and pseudomomentum at leading order. We also show how the wave-action
conservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting. To make the paper
self-contained, we introduce the tools of differential geometry and main ideas
of geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely. We mostly focus on the Euler
equations for incompressible inviscid fluids but sketch out extensions to the
rotating-stratified Boussinesq, compressible Euler and magnetohydrodynamic
equations.

and CMB S4, that is, using the five relevant auto- and cross-correlations of
the two datasets. We conclude that advances in modeling the nonlinear regime
and the measurements of other parameters are required to ensure a neutrino mass
detection. Using the same datasets, we explore the ability of LSST-era surveys
to test ""nonstandard"" models with dark radiation. We find that if evidence for
dark radiation is found from $N_{\rm eff}$ measurements, the mass of the dark
radiation candidate can be measured at a 1-$\sigma$ level of $0.162\,$eV for
fermionic dark radiation, and $0.137\,$eV for bosonic dark radiation, for
$\Delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.15$. We also find that the NNaturalness model of
Arkani-Hamed et al 2016, with extra light degrees of freedom, has a sub-percent
effect on the power spectrum: even more ambitious surveys than the ones
considered here will be needed to test such models.

ationary models allowed. The current best fit region favors concave downwards
in ationary potentials, since they produce a suppressed tensor to scalar index
ratio r. Concave downward potentials have a negative curvature V""<0, therefore
a tachyonic mass square that drives fluctuations. Furthermore, their use can
become problematic if the field rolls in a part of the potential away from the
extrema, since the semiclassical approximation of quantum cosmology, used for
deriving the most probable wavefunction of the universe from the landscape and
for addressing the quantum to classical transition, breaks down away from the
steepest descent region. We here propose a way of dealing with such potentials
by inverting the metric signature and solving for the wavefunction of the
universe in the Euclidean sector. This method allows us to extend our theory of
the origin of the universe from a quantum multiverse, to a more general class
of concave inflationary potentials where a straightforward application of the
semiclassical approximation fails. The work here completes the derivation of
modifications to the Newtonian potential and to the inflationary potential,
which originate from the quantum entanglement of our universe with all others
in the quantum landscape multiverse, leading to predictions of observational
signatures for both types of in ationary models, concave and convex potentials.

chondrite, probably similar to S- or Q-type asteroids. Therefore,
nanoindentation experiments on this meteorite allow us to obtain key data to
understand the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Tests at different
length scales provide information about the local mechanical properties of the
minerals forming this meteorite: reduced Young's modulus, hardness, elastic
recovery, and fracture toughness. Those tests are also useful to understand the
potential to deflect threatening asteroids using a kinetic projectile. We found
that the differences in mechanical properties between regions of the meteorite,
which increase or reduce the efficiency of impacts, are not a result of
compositional differences. A low mean particle size, attributed to repetitive
shock, can increase hardness, while low porosity promotes a higher momentum
multiplication. Momentum multiplication is the ratio between the change in
momentum of a target due to an impact, and the momentum of the projectile, and,
therefore higher values imply more efficient impacts. In the Chelyabinsk
meteorite, the properties of the light-colored lithology materials facilitate
obtaining higher momentum multiplication values, compared to the other regions
described for this meteorite. Also, we found a low value of fracture toughness
in the shock-melt veins of Chelyabinsk, which would promote the ejection of
material after an impact and, therefore, increase the momentum multiplication.
These results are relevant considering the growing interest in missions to test
asteroid deflection, such as the recent collaboration between the European
Space Agency and NASA, known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment
mission.

Planet flux densities","20 pages, 14 figures, abstract abridged for arXiv submission","A&A 607, A122 (2017)","10.1051/0004-6361/201630311",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements of flux density are described for five planets, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, across the six Planck High Frequency Instrument
frequency bands (100-857 GHz) and these are then compared with models and
existing data. In our analysis, we have also included estimates of the
brightness of Jupiter and Saturn at the three frequencies of the Planck Low
Frequency Instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz). The results provide constraints on
the intrinsic brightness and the brightness time-variability of these planets.
The majority of the planet flux density estimates are limited by systematic
errors, but still yield better than 1% measurements in many cases. Applying
data from Planck HFI, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to a model that incorporates contributions
from Saturn's rings to the planet's total flux density suggests a best fit
value for the spectral index of Saturn's ring system of $\beta _\mathrm{ring} =
2.30\pm0.03$ over the 30-1000 GHz frequency range. The average ratio between
the Planck-HFI measurements and the adopted model predictions for all five
planets (excluding Jupiter observations for 353 GHz) is 0.997, 0.997, 1.018,
and 1.032 for 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. Model predictions for
planet thermodynamic temperatures are therefore consistent with the absolute
calibration of Planck-HFI detectors at about the three-percent-level. We
compare our measurements with published results from recent cosmic microwave
background experiments. In particular, we observe that the flux densities
measured by Planck HFI and WMAP agree to within 2%. These results allow
experiments operating in the mm-wavelength range to cross-calibrate against
Planck and improve models of radiative transport used in planetary science.

proposed a definition for the relative entropy of steering and showed that the
resulting quantity is a convex steering monotone. Here we advocate for a
different definition for relative entropy of steering, based on well grounded
concerns coming from quantum Shannon theory. We prove that this modified
relative entropy of steering is a convex steering monotone. Furthermore, we
establish that it is uniformly continuous and faithful, in both cases giving
quantitative bounds that should be useful in applications. We also consider a
restricted relative entropy of steering which is relevant for the case in which
the free operations in the resource theory of steering have a more restricted
form (the restricted operations could be more relevant in practical scenarios).
The restricted relative entropy of steering is convex, monotone with respect to
these restricted operations, uniformly continuous, and faithful.

Structure from Motion (SfM). In this paper, we propose a unified framework to
divide the image set into clusters suitable for reconstruction as well as find
multiple reliable and stable starting points. Image partitioning performs in
two steps. First, some small image groups are selected at places with high
image density, and then all the images are clustered according to their optimal
reconstruction paths to these image groups. This promises that the scene is
always reconstructed from dense places to sparse areas, which can reduce error
accumulation when images have weak overlap. To enable faster speed, images
outside the selected group in each cluster are further divided to achieve a
greater degree of parallelism. Experiments show that our method achieves
significant speedup, higher accuracy and better completeness.

Random Access (SMRA). In SMRA, a set of correlated sources is encoded once for
all and stored on a server, and clients want to successively access to only a
subset of the sources. Since the number of simultaneous clients can be huge,
the server is only allowed to extract a bitstream from the stored data: no
re-encoding can be performed before the transmission of the specific client's
request. In this paper, we formally define the SMRA framework and introduce
both storage and transmission rates to characterize the performance of SMRA. We
derive achievable transmission and storage rates for lossless source coding of
i.i.d. and non i.i.d. sources, and transmission and storage rates-distortion
regions for Gaussian sources. We also show two practical implementations of
SMRA systems based on rate-compatible LDPC codes. Both theoretical and
experimental results demonstrate that SMRA systems can reach the same
transmission rates as in traditional point to point source coding schemes,
while having a reasonable overhead in terms of storage rate. These results
constitute a breakthrough for many recent data transmission applications in
which different parts of the data are requested by the clients.

far, theoretical studies of the transition have focused mainly on the case of

investigate the regime close to the many-body localization transition in

sound characterization of the inherent uncertainties. One of the major
uncertainties is the possible rapid disintegration of large fractions of the

potentially lead to several meters of sea-level rise during the next few
centuries. Previous studies have typically been silent on two coupled
questions: (i) What are probabilistic estimates of this ""fast dynamics""
contribution to sea-level rise? (ii) What are the implications for strategies
to manage coastal flooding risks? Here, we present probabilistic hindcasts and
projections of sea-level rise to 2100. The fast dynamics mechanism is
approximated by a simple parameterization, designed to allow for a careful
quantification of the uncertainty in its contribution to sea-level rise. We
estimate that global temperature increases ranging from 1.9 to 3.1{\deg}C
coincide with fast Antarctic disintegration, and these contributions account
for sea-level rise of 21-74 centimeters this century (5-95% range,
Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). We use a simple cost-benefit
analysis of coastal defense to demonstrate in a didactic exercise how
neglecting this mechanism and associated uncertainty can (i) lead to strategies
which fall sizably short of protection targets and (ii) increase the expected

at least 4 different universality classes (directed percolation, dynamical

mapping the corresponding Langevin equations describing each of these classes

might induce avalanche merging-- has not been noticed (or emphasized) in the
past. We believe that a simple an unified perspective as the one presented here
can (i) help to clarify the overall picture, (ii) underline the
super-universality of the behavior as well as the dependence on external
driving, and (iii) help avoiding the common existing confusion between
un-biased branching processes (equivalent to a random walker in a balanced
logarithmic potential) and standard (un-confined) random walkers.

proposed as a general model of chemical computation. It is found that entropy
driven computation is subject to a trade-off between accuracy and entropy
production, but unlike many biological systems, there are no trade-offs
involving time. The latter only arise when it is taken into account that the
observation of the state of the EDC is not energy neutral, but comes at a cost.

rise to a finite slope at the zone center in their corresponding phonon

dielectric properties of the surrounding media. Screening from the environment
can greatly reduce the slope splitting between the longitudinal and transverse

theory of causal fermion systems, are found to have an underlying Hamiltonian
structure, giving a formulation of the dynamics in terms of physical fields in
space-time. After generalizing causal variational principles to a class of
lower semi-continuous Lagrangians on a smooth, possibly non-compact manifold,
the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are derived. In the first part, it
is shown under additional smoothness assumptions that the space of solutions of
the Euler-Lagrange equations has the structure of a symplectic Fr\'echet
manifold. The symplectic form is constructed as a surface layer integral which
is shown to be invariant under the time evolution. In the second part, the
results and methods are extended to the non-smooth setting. The physical fields
correspond to variations of the universal measure described infinitesimally by
one-jets. Evaluating the Euler-Lagrange equations weakly, we derive linearized
field equations for these jets. In the final part, our constructions and
results are illustrated in a detailed example on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$
where a local minimizer is given by a measure supported on a two-dimensional
lattice.

case where the response and covariates are iid elements of an infinite
dimensional Hilbert space. The unknown to be estimated is a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator, whose inverse is by definition unbounded, rendering the problem of
inference ill-posed. In this paper, we consider the more general context where
the sample of response/covariate pairs forms a weakly dependent stationary
process in the respective product Hilbert space: simply stated, the case where
we have a regression between functional time series. We consider a general
framework of potentially nonlinear processes, exploiting recent advances in the
spectral analysis of time series. Our main result is the establishment of the
rate of convergence for the corresponding estimators of the regression
coefficients, the latter forming a summable sequence in the space of
Hilbert-Schmidt operators. In a sense, our main result can be seen as a
generalisation of the classical functional linear model rates, to the case of
time series, and rests only upon cumulant mixing conditions. While the analysis
becomes considerably more involved in the dependent case, the rates are
strikingly comparable to those of the i.i.d. case, but at the expense of an
additional factor caused by the necessity to estimate the spectral density
operator at a nonparametric rate, as opposed to the parametric rate for
covariance operator estimation.

on the other side. This is shown to be a consequence of the nonreciprocity in
reflection due to the inherent asymmetry of the KK medium. We further look at
the possibility of surface modes for unidirectional illumination. For specific
range of parameters, we show the existence of TM polarized surface plasmons
only for illumination from one side. The origin of such modes is traced to the
inhomogeneous metal like layer with negative real part of the permittivity in

method which is more general than the $\mathrm{tanh}$-method. The method works
by assuming that a polynomial ansatz satisfies a Weierstrass equation, and has
two advantages: first, it reduces the number of terms in the ansatz by an order
of two, and second, it uses Weierstrass functions which satisfy an elliptic
equation for the dependent variable instead of the hyperbolic tangent functions
which only satisfy the Riccati equation with constant coefficients.
  When the polynomial ansatz in the traveling wave variable is of first order,
the equation reduces to the KdV equation with only a cubic dispersion term,
while for the KE which includes a fifth order dispersion term the polynomial
ansatz must necessary be of quadratic type.
  By solving the elliptic equation with coefficients that depend on the
boundary conditions, velocity of the traveling waves, nonlinear strength, and
dispersion coefficients, in the case of KdV equation we find the well-known
solitary waves (solitons) for zero boundary conditions, as well as wave-trains
of cnoidal waves for nonzero boundary conditions. Both solutions are either
compressive (bright) or rarefactive (dark), and either propagate to the left or

as an alternative approach: the smaller of two input random numbers is divided
by the larger, resulting in a rational number from $[0,1]$.
  We investigate theoretical properties of this approach and show that it
yields a good approximation to the ideal uniform distribution. To evaluate the
empirical properties we use the well-known test suite \textsc{TestU01}. We
apply the ratio transformation to moderately bad generators, i.e. those that
failed up to 40\% of the tests from the test battery \textsc{Crush} of
\textsc{TestU01}. We show that more than half of them turn into very good
generators that pass all tests of \textsc{Crush} and \textsc{BigCrush} from

generators based on linear operations seem to benefit from the ratio, as this
breaks up some of the unwanted regularities in the input sequences. Thus the

functional communication due to the presence of voice and speech disorders
associated with dysarthria that can be characterized by monotony of pitch (or
fundamental frequency), reduced loudness, irregular rate of speech, imprecise
consonants, and changes in voice quality. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs)
work with patients with PD to improve speech intelligibility using various
intensive in-clinic speech treatments. SLPs also prescribe home exercises to
enhance generalization of speech strategies outside of the treatment room. Even
though speech therapies are found to be highly effective in improving vocal
loudness and speech quality, patients with PD find it difficult to follow the
prescribed exercise regimes outside the clinic and to continue exercises once
the treatment is completed. SLPs need techniques to monitor compliance and
accuracy of their patients exercises at home and in ecologically valid
communication situations. We have designed EchoWear, a smartwatch-based system,
to remotely monitor speech and voice exercises as prescribed by SLPs. We
conducted a study of 6 individuals; three with PD and three healthy controls.
To assess the performance of EchoWear technology compared with high quality
audio equipment obtained in a speech laboratory. Our preliminary analysis shows
promising outcomes for using EchoWear in speech therapies for people with PD.

e.g., as sequences of visited websites or as sequences of locations captured by
GPS. However, understanding factors explaining the production of sequence data
is a challenging task, especially since the data generation is often not
homogeneous. For example, navigation behavior might change in different phases
of browsing a website, or movement behavior may vary between groups of users.
In this work, we tackle this task and propose MixedTrails, a Bayesian approach
for comparing the plausibility of hypotheses regarding the generative processes
of heterogeneous sequence data. Each hypothesis is derived from existing
literature, theory or intuition and represents a belief about transition
probabilities between a set of states that can vary between groups of observed
transitions. For example, when trying to understand human movement in a city
and given some observed data, a hypothesis assuming tourists to be more likely
to move towards points of interests than locals, can be shown to be more
plausible than a hypothesis assuming the opposite. Our approach incorporates
such hypotheses as Bayesian priors in a generative mixed transition Markov
chain model, and compares their plausibility utilizing Bayes factors. We
discuss analytical and approximate inference methods for calculating the
marginal likelihoods for Bayes factors, give guidance on interpreting the
results, and illustrate our approach with several experiments on synthetic and
empirical data from Wikipedia and Flickr. Thus, this work enables a novel kind
of analysis for studying sequential data in many application areas.

thrust. In it, the gravitational field affects the physical standards of space
and time, but motion is governed by an extension of the relativistic form of
Newton's second law. This implies Einstein's geodesic motion for free particles
only in a constant gravitational field. In this work, equations governing the
dynamics of a continuous medium subjected to gravitational and
non-gravitational forces are derived. Then, the case where the
non-gravitational force is the Lorentz force is investigated. The gravitational
modification of Maxwell's equations is obtained under the requirement that a
charged continuous medium, subjected to the Lorentz force, obeys the equation
derived for continuum dynamics under external forces. These Maxwell equations
are shown to be consistent with the dynamics of a ""free"" photon, and thus with
the geometrical optics of this theory. However, these equations do not imply
local charge conservation, except for a constant gravitational field.

the Mould effect, after Steve Mould who discovered this phenomenon and made
this experiment famous on YouTube, in a video that went viral. The reason for
the emergence of this fountain remains unclear. This effect was shown to be due
to an anomalous reaction force from the top of the pile of beads, a possible

pattern for n Unequal Circle items in a two-dimensional Square Container

previous work on an Action Space based Global Optimization (ASGO) that
approximates each circle item as a square item to efficiently find the large
unoccupied spaces, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the
Partitioned Action Space and Partitioned Circle Items (PAS-PCI). The PAS is to
partition the narrow action space on the long side to find two equal action
spaces to fully utilize the unoccupied spaces. The PCI is to partition the
circle items into four groups based on size for the basin hopping strategy.
Experiments on two sets of benchmark instances show the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In comparison with our previous algorithm ASGO on the 68
tested instances that ASGO published, PAS-PCI not only gains smaller containers
in 64 instances and matches the other 4 but also runs faster in most instances.
In comparison with the best record of the Packomania website on a total of 98
