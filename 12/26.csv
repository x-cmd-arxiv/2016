vision and pattern recognition. The main difficulties in the tracking field are
appearance variation and occlusion. Most traditional tracking methods set the
parameters or templates to track target objects in advance and should be
modified accordingly. Thus, we propose a new and robust tracking method using a
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to obtain an object probability map and
Dynamic Programming (DP) to seek the globally optimal path through all frames
of video. Our proposed method solves the object appearance variation problem
with the use of a FCN and deals with occlusion by DP. We show that our method
is effective in tracking various single objects through video frames.

surrounded by three-dimensional fluids on both sides. In the membrane, the
tangential stress should be continuous across the domain perimeter, which makes
the velocity gradient discontinuous there unless the ratio of the membrane
viscosity inside the domain to the one outside the domain equals unity. The
gradient of the velocity field in the three-dimensional fluids is continuous.
This field, in the limit that the spatial point approaches the membrane, should
agree with the velocity field of the membrane. Thus, unless the ratio of the
membrane viscosities is unity, we need to assume some additional singularity at
the domain perimeter in solving the governing equations. In our result, the
drag coefficient is given in a series expansion with respect to a dimensionless
parameter, which equals zero when the ratio of the membrane viscosities is
unity and approaches unity when the ratio tends to infinity. We derive the

  in Metastable Austenitic Stainless Steel: An In-situ TEM Study",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the mechanism of martensitic transformation is of great
importance in developing advanced high strength steels, especially
TRansformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels. The TRIP effect leads to
enhanced work-hardening rate, postponed onset of necking and excellent
formability. In-situ transmission electron microscopy has been performed to
systematically investigate the dynamic interactions between dislocations and
alpha martensite at microscale. Local stress concentrations, e.g. from notches
or dislocation pile-ups, render free edges and grain boundaries favorable
nucleation sites for alpha martensite. Its growth leads to partial dislocation
emission on two independent slip planes from the hetero-interface when the
austenite matrix is initially free of dislocations. The kinematic analysis
reveals that activating slip systems on two independent {111} planes of
austenite are necessary in accommodating the interfacial mismatch strain. Full
dislocation emission is generally observed inside of austenite regions that
contain high density of dislocations. In both situations, phase boundary
propagation generates large amounts of dislocations entering into the matrix,
which renders the total deformation compatible and provide substantial strain
hardening of the host phase. These moving dislocation sources enable plastic
relaxation and prevent local damage accumulation by intense slipping on the
softer side of the interfacial region. Thus, finely dispersed martensite
distribution renders plastic deformation more uniform throughout the austenitic
matrix, which explains the exceptional combination of strength and ductility of
TRIP steels.

based on a hierarchical normal model. While commonly used interval procedures
based on such a model have the nominal coverage rate on average across a
population of groups, their actual coverage rate for a given group will be
above or below the nominal rate, depending on the value of the group mean.
Alternatively, a coverage rate that is constant as a function of a group's mean
can be simply achieved by using a standard $t$-interval, based on data only
from that group. The standard $t$-interval, however, fails to share information
across the groups and is therefore not adaptive to easily obtained information
about the distribution of group-specific means.
  In this article we construct confidence intervals that have a constant
frequentist coverage rate and that make use of information about across-group
heterogeneity, resulting in constant-coverage intervals that are narrower than
standard $t$-intervals on average across groups. Such intervals are constructed
by inverting biased tests for the mean of a normal population. Given a prior
distribution on the mean, Bayes-optimal biased tests can be inverted to form
Bayes-optimal confidence intervals with frequentist coverage that is constant
as a function of the mean. In the context of multiple groups, the prior
distribution is replaced by a model of across-group heterogeneity. The
parameters for this model can be estimated using data from all of the groups,
and used to obtain confidence intervals with constant group-specific coverage
that adapt to information about the distribution of group means.

connected open set with $C^2$ boundary $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We
classify the behavior of $s$-minimal surfaces with respect to the fixed

small and depending on the data at infinity, the $s$-minimal set can be either
empty in $\Omega$, fill all $\Omega$, or possibly develop a wildly oscillating

component of cold dark matter (CDM) in the Universe. The axion particle, first
theorized as a solution to the strong charge-parity problem of quantum
chromodynamics, has been established as a prominent CDM candidate. Cosmic
observation and particle physics experiments have bracketed the unknown mass of
CDM axions between approximately {\mu}eV and meV. The Axion Dark Matter
eXperim8ent (ADMX) is a direct-detection CDM axion search which has set limits
at the KSVZ coupling of the axion to two photons for axion masses between 1.9
and 3.7 {\mu}eV. The current upgrades will allow ADMX to detect axions with
even the most pessimistic couplings in this mass range. In order to expand the
mass reach of the detector, extensive research and development of microwave
cavity technologies, tunable microwave SQUID amplifiers, and piezoelectric
drives is being conducted. ADMX is projected to explore more than one decade of
the allowable mass range with DFSZ coupling sensitivity in the near future.
Status of the experiment, current research and development, and projected
results are discussed.

with extraordinarily high equivalent width (EQW~200 Angstroms) and somewhat
less broadened H-alpha (~220 km/s). Emission lines of N V and O VI are not
detected, which constrains the rate at which gas cools through temperatures of
10^6 K to be less than about 10 solar masses/year. The COS spectra also show a
flat rest-frame UV continuum with weak stellar photospheric features,
consistent with the presence of recently-formed hot stars forming at a rate of
~10 solar masses/year, uncorrected for dust extinction. The slope and
absorption lines in these UV spectra are similar to those of Lyman Break
Galaxies at z approximately 3, albeit those with the highest Lyman-alpha
equivalent widths and star-formation rates. This high-EQW Lyman-alpha source is
a high-metallicity galaxy rapidly forming stars in structures that look nothing
like disks. This mode of star formation could significantly contribute to the
spheroidal population of galaxies. The constraint on the luminosity of any O VI
line emission is stringent enough to rule out steady and simultaneous gas
cooling and star formation, unlike similar systems in the Phoenix Cluster and

stochastic simulations at the level of individual hexamers allows us to
identify a new mechanism, which is employed by the new model to achieve input
compensation: At lower ATP fraction, the individual hexamers make a shorter
cycle in the phosphorylation state space, which compensates for the slower pace
at which they traverse the cycle.

structure characterization. The essential idea is to combine our multiscale
rigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a
series of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent
entropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of
our method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great
detail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological
entropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various
scales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale
persistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More
specifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural
classification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a
multiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle
distributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with
the traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is
able to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much
better than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate
range. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification.
For a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation
between all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the
dihedral and pseudo-bond angle information. Finally, a special protein
structure index (PSI) is proposed, for the first time, to describe the
""regularity"" of protein structures. Essentially, PSI can be used to describe
the ""regularity"" information in any systems.

created a project during which students build a stable submarine that uses
fluid transfers to move up, down, and forward while carrying a load. Students

new functional-analytical formulation of optimal matching, giving rise to the
class of GOM methods, for which we provide a single unified theory to analyze
tractability, consistency, and efficiency. Many commonly used existing methods
are included in GOM and, using their GOM interpretation, can be extended to
optimally and automatically trade off balance for variance and outperform their
standard counterparts. As a subclass, GOM gives rise to kernel optimal matching
(KOM), which, as supported by new theoretical and empirical results, is notable
for combining many of the positive properties of other methods in one. KOM,
which is solved as a linearly-constrained convex-quadratic optimization
problem, inherits both the interpretability and model-free consistency of
matching but can also achieve the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency of well-specified
regression and the efficiency and robustness of doubly robust methods. In
settings of limited overlap, KOM enables a very transparent method for interval
estimation for partial identification and robust coverage. We demonstrate these

models. Inflationary models with convex potentials have now been ruled out
since they produce a large tensor to scalar ratio. Meanwhile the same data
offers interesting hints on possible deviations from the standard picture of
CMB perturbations. Here we revisit the predictions of the theory of the origin
of the universe from the landscape multiverse for the case of exponential
inflation, for two reasons: firstly to check the status of the anomalies
associated with this theory, in the light of the recent Planck data; secondly,
to search for a counterexample whereby new physics modifications may bring
convex inflationary potentials, thought to have been ruled out, back into the
region of potentials allowed by data. Using the exponential inflation as an
example of convex potentials, we find that the answer to both tests is
positive: modifications to the perturbation spectrum and to the Newtonian
potential of the universe originating from the quantum entanglement, bring the
exponential potential, back within the allowed region of current data; and, the
series of anomalies previously predicted in this theory, is still in good
agreement with current data. Hence our finding for this convex potential comes
at the price of allowing for additional thermal relic particles, equivalently
dark radiation, in the early universe.

the city's economy. Then, relying on critical slowing down signals related to
the stability of an equilibrium point, we present an algorithm for engineering
regime shifts such that a city at a stable equilibrium point may continue to
grow again. The generality of the model and the algorithm used here implies
that the model and algorithm need not be restricted to urban systems; they are
easily applicable to other types of systems where the assumptions used are
valid.

several research applications. More specifically, applications such as a) an
optimized automated Ground Level Enhancement Alert (GLE Alert Plus) b) a web
interface, providing data from mul- tiple Neutron Monitor stations
(Multi-Station tool) and c) a simulation model, named DYnamic Atmospheric
Shower Tracking Interactive Model Application (DYASTIMA), which allows the
study of the cosmic ray showers resulted when primary cosmic ray particles
enters the atmosphere, have been developed. The two first applications are
currently federated products in European Space Agency (ESA) and actually
available via the Space Weather Portal operated by ESA. On the other hand, the
contribution of the simulation tool DYASTIMA, based on the well known Geant4
toolkit, to the calculations of the radiation dose received by air crews and
passengers within the Earth's atmosphere led us to develop an extended
application of DYASTIMA named DYASTIMA-R. This new application calculates the
energy that is deposited on the phantom and moreover the equivalent dose.
Furthermore, a Space Weather Forecasting Center which provides a three day
geomagnetic activity report on a daily basis has been set up and is operating
at the Athens Neutron Monitor Sta- tion. Finally, all above developed services
are in essential importance for the fundamental research as well as for
practical applications concerning Space Weather.

show that the track number $\tau(L(K_n))$ of the line graph of the complete

improves the bound of $\Omega(\lg\lg n/ \lg\lg\lg n)$ in MSW15. Next we show
that for a family of graphs $\mathcal{G}$, $\{\tau(L(G)):G \in \mathcal{G}\}$
is bounded if and only if $\{\chi(G):G \in \mathcal{G}\}$ is bounded. This
affirms a conjecture in MSW15. All our lower bounds apply even if one enlarges

related to specific spatial distribution of the interstellar dust around the
stars, caused by a gyrorotation of charged dust grains in the interstellar
magnetic filed. Our numerical model describes the dust dynamics in astrospheres
under an influence of the Lorentz force and assumption of a constant dust
charge. Calculations are performed for the dust grains with different sizes
separately. It is shown that non-monotonic spatial dust distribution (viewed as
filaments) appears for dust grains with the period of gyromotion comparable
with the characteristic time scale of the dust motion in the astrosphere.
Numerical modelling demonstrates that number of filaments depends on
charge-to-mass ratio of dust.

is a type of cooperative games where players may gain popularity by
strategically forming groups. A group is socially cohesive if the grand
coalition is core stable. We study social cohesion in some special types of

structural cohesion. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given
social network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is
CoNP-complete. Nevertheless, we give two efficient heuristics for coalition
structures where players enjoy high popularity and experimentally evaluate

always used in the approaches of unsteady flows, and the ability of dual
time-stepping to accelerate the computation with acceptable error tolerance is
evident. In our paper, we adopt the techniques of dual time-stepping methods
for implicit gas-kinetic scheme to simulate the unsteady flows, which is very
popular for the numerical methods based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It is
carried out by (a) solving the gas-kinetic scheme in finite volume method; (b)
obtaining the inviscid flux Jacobian by Roe scheme; (c) involving the
computation of viscous flux Jacobian which is not mentioned in the previous
implicit gas-kinetic schemes; (d) approximating the linear system of pseudo
steady state by generalized minimal residual algorithm (GMRES). The explicit
gas-kinetic scheme has been proved to be an accurate approach for both the
steady and unsteady flows, and the implicit gas-kinetic scheme is also be
developed to accelerate the convergence of steady state. The dual time-stepping
method proposed in our study is of great importance to the computations of
unsteady flows. Several numerical cases are performed to evaluate the behavior
of dual time stepping strategy of gas-kinetic scheme. The incompressible flow
around blunt bodies (stationary circular cylinder and square cylinder) and the
transonic buffet on the NACA0012 airfoil are simulated to demonstrate the
overall performance of the proposed method which is applicable to the fluid
flows from laminar to turbulent and from incompressible to compressible.

electronic band structure. The calculated spin wave dispersions with realistic
three-band parameters are in excellent agreement with the RIXS data for
iridates, including the strong AF zone boundary dispersion in the single-layer
compound $\rm Sr_2 Ir O_4$ and the large anisotropy gap in the bilayer compound

the triangular solution in the relativistic three-body problem for general
masses by the standard linear algebraic analysis. In this paper, we start with
the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman form of equations of motion for $N$-body systems in
the uniformly rotating frame. As an extension of the previous work, we consider
general perturbations to the equilibrium, i.e. we take account of perturbations
orthogonal to the orbital plane, as well as perturbations lying on it. It is
found that the orthogonal perturbations depend on each other by the first
post-Newtonian (1PN) three-body interactions, though these are independent of
the lying ones likewise the Newtonian case. We also show that the orthogonal
perturbations do not affect the condition of stability. This is because these
always precess with two frequency modes; the same with the orbital frequency
and the slightly different one by the 1PN effect. The same condition of
stability with the previous one, which is valid even for the general
perturbations, is obtained from the lying perturbations.

survival response variables. We propose a two-step model averaging procedure
for improving the forecasting accuracy of the true conditional mean of a
survival response variable. The first step is to construct a class of candidate
models, each with low-dimensional covariates. For this, a feature screening
procedure is developed to separate the active and inactive predictors through a
marginal BuckleyCJames index, and to group covariates with a similar index size
together to form regression models with survival response variables. The
proposed screening method can select active predictors under
covariate-dependent censoring, and enjoys sure screening consistency under mild
regularity conditions. The second step is to find the optimal model weights for
averaging by adapting a delete-one cross-validation criterion, without the
standard constraint that the weights sum to one. The theoretical results show
that the delete-one cross-validation criterion achieves the lowest possible
forecasting loss asymptotically. Numerical studies demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed variable screening and model averaging procedures
over existing methods.

Oct 2016. 140 pages",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we are interested in understanding how Lorentz symmetry
violation can affect some features of fermion dynamics and, perhaps, help to
solve some well-known problems in particle physics, such as the origin of
neutrino masses and oscillations.
  Firstly, we consider two Lorentz-Invariance-Violating (LIV) models and
investigate the possibility of generating masses and oscillations dynamically
for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, using non-perturbative methods, such as
the Schwinger-Dyson and the effective potential approaches. In our studies,
Lorentz symmetric models are extended by the inclusion of higher-order LIV
operators, which improve the convergence of loop integrals and introduce a
natural mass scale to the theories. We then present how Lorentz invariance can
be recovered, for both models, after quantisation, in such a way that the
dynamical masses and mixing are the only quantum effects that remain finite.
  Additionally, we study how matter fields, especially fermions, behave when
coupled to two modified gravity models. Such modified gravity models break the
4-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and, consequently, induce local Lorentz
violation. In particular, we consider Horava-Lifshitz gravity, which presents
an improved ultraviolet behaviour when compared to General Relativity (GR), and
thus addresses a fundamental problem in physics: the
non-(perturbative-)renormalisability of the theory of GR. We calculate the LIV
one-loop corrections to the matter sector dispersion relations, after
integration over graviton components, and show that, by imposing reasonable
constraints on the energy scales of our gravity models, our results are
consistent with the current bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation.

  We compute explicitly the absolute contribution of square-tiled surfaces
having a single horizontal cylinder to the Masur-Veech volume of any ambient
stratum of Abelian differentials. The resulting count is particularly simple
and efficient in the large genus asymptotics. We conjecture that the
corresponding relative contribution is asymptotically of the order $1/d$, where
$d$ is the dimension of the stratum, and prove that this conjecture is
equivalent to the long-standing conjecture on the large genus asymptotics of
the Masur-Veech volumes. We prove, in particular, that the recent results of

stratum of Abelian differentials as the genus tends to infinity.

sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters
configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default

a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a

Reasonable arguments indicate that they are good candidates of pure molecular

decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data
sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e.
decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs),
visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which
can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then
utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional
activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists
to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected
regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually
selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain
image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series.
Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of
voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine
different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental
studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos)
confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to
state-of-the-art methods.

We then show that the unbounded Kasparov product by a Morita equivalence
bimodule induces an isomorphism between equivalence classes of twisted spectral
triples over Morita equivalent operator *-algebras. This leads to a tentative
definition of unbounded bivariant K-theory and we prove that this bivariant
theory is related to Kasparov's bivariant K-theory via the Baaj-Julg bounded
transform. Moreover, the unbounded Kasparov product provides a refinement of
the usual interior Kasparov product. We illustrate our results by proving
C^1-versions of well-known C^*-algebraic Morita equivalences in the context of
hereditary subalgebras, conformal equivalences and crossed products by discrete
groups.

is of high scientific and technological relevance, but poses significant
conceptual and numerical challenges. To address these, we develop the
correlated signal inference (CSI) algorithm within information field theory
(IFT) and discuss its numerical implementation. To this end, we introduce the
free energy exploration (FrEE) strategy for numerical information field theory
(NIFTy) applications. The FrEE strategy is to let the mathematical structure of
the inference problem determine the dynamics of the numerical solver. FrEE uses
the Gibbs free energy formalism for all involved unknown fields and correlation
structures without marginalization of nuisance quantities. It thereby avoids
the complexity marginalization often impose to IFT equations. FrEE
simultaneously solves for the mean and the uncertainties of signal, nuisance,
and auxiliary fields, while exploiting any analytically calculable quantity.
Finally, FrEE uses a problem specific and self-tuning exploration strategy to
swiftly identify the optimal field estimates as well as their uncertainty maps.
For all estimated fields, properly weighted posterior samples drawn from their
exact, fully non-Gaussian distributions can be generated. Here, we develop the
FrEE strategies for the CSI of a normal, a log-normal, and a Poisson log-normal
IFT signal inference problem and demonstrate their performances via their NIFTy
implementations.

without requiring any preprocessing such as scan denoising or converting into a

uniquely defined local reference frame and concatenating geometric centroid and
point density features extracted from each voxel. Second, we compare two
descriptors by employing only corresponding voxels that are both non-empty,
thus supporting matching incomplete local shape such as those close to scan
boundary. Third, we propose a descriptor saliency measure and compute it from a
descriptor-graph to improve shape matching performance. We demonstrate the
descriptor's robustness and effectiveness for shape matching by comparing it
with three state-of-the-art descriptors, and applying it to object/scene
reconstruction and 3D object recognition.

affected by Poisson noise. In this paper, we propose a dictionary learning
model by employing patches based sparsity to denoise Poisson phaseless

orthogonal dictionary, (ii) an $L^0$ pseudo norm of coefficient matrix, and
(iii) a Kullback-Leibler divergence to fit phaseless Poisson data. Fast
Alternating Minimization Method (AMM) and Proximal Alternating Linearized
Minimization (PALM) are adopted to solve the established model with convergence
guarantee, and especially global convergence for PALM is derived. The
subproblems for two algorithms have fast solvers, and indeed, the solutions for
the sparse coding and dictionary updating both have closed forms due to the
orthogonality of learned dictionaries. Numerical experiments for phase
retrieval using coded diffraction and ptychographic patterns are performed to
show the efficiency and robustness of proposed methods, which, by preserving
texture features, produce visually and quantitatively improved denoised images
compared with other phase retrieval algorithms without regularization and local
sparsity promoting algorithms.

statistical assumptions. The current work raises doubts over this determination
by showing that: (1) These assumptions are not consistent with additional
assumptions such as sparsity and Gaussianity. (2) The empirical Bayes
