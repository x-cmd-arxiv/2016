Magellanic Clouds, the Milky Way, and the resulting tidal features, is still
poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) has a very extended disk strikingly perturbed in its outskirts. We search
for recent star formation in the far outskirts of the LMC, out to ~30 degrees
from its center. We have collected intermediate-resolution spectra of
thirty-one young star candidates in the periphery of the LMC and measured their
radial velocity, stellar parameters, distance and age. Our measurements confirm
membership to the LMC of six targets, for which the radial velocity and
distance values match well those of the Cloud. These objects are all young
(10-50 Myr), main-sequence stars projected between 7 and 13 degrees from the
center of the parent galaxy. We compare the velocities of our stars with those
of a disk model, and find that our stars have low to moderate velocity
differences with the disk model predictions, indicating that they were formed
in situ. Our study demonstrates that recent star formation occurred in the far
periphery of the LMC, where thus far only old objects were known. The spatial
configuration of these newly-formed stars appears ring-like with a radius of 12
kpc, and a displacement of 2.6 kpc from the LMC's center. This structure, if
real, would be suggestive of a star-formation episode triggered by an
off-center collision between the Small Magellanic Cloud and the LMC's disk.

result of the combination of a fundamental model and a model-based aggregation

well suited to deal with increasingly frequent situations in which new
political parties enter an electoral competition, although our approach is
general enough to accommodate any other electoral situation. We illustrate the
advantages of our method using the 2015 Spanish Congressional Election in which
two new parties ended up receiving 30\% of the votes. We compare the predictive
performance of our model versus alternative models. In general the predictions
of our model outperform the alternative specifications, including hybrid models
that combine fundamental and polls models. Our predictions are, in relative

constructing two sets of nonlinear solutions up to the second order. The first
solution exhibits perfect oscillations in the linear regime and phase mixing
appears only nonlinearly in the second order as a response to the ponderomotive
forces. This response can be both direct and indirect. The indirect
contribution of the ponderomotive forces appears through self-consistently
generated low frequency fields. Furthermore, the direct and indirect
contributions of the ponderomotive forces on the phase mixing process is
explored and it is found that the indirect contribution is negligible in an
electron-ion plasma and it disappears in the case of electron-positron plasma,
yet represents an equal contribution in the electron-positron-ion plasma.
However, the second solution does not exhibit any phase mixing due to the
absence of ponderomotive forces but results in an undistorted nonlinear
traveling wave. These investigations have relevance for
laboratory/astrophysical multi-species plasma.

theoretical and experimental progress. Nevertheless, a full-fledged
classification of its coupling regimes remains as a relevant open question. We
propose a spectral classification dividing the coupling regimes into three
regions based on the validity of perturbative criteria on the quantum Rabi
model, which allows us the use of exactly solvable effective Hamiltonians.
These coupling regimes are i) the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime
which comprises the Jaynes-Cummings model, ii) a region where non-perturbative
ultrastrong and non-perturbative deep strong coupling regimes coexist, and iii)
the perturbative deep strong coupling regime. We show that this spectral
classification depends not only on the ratio between the coupling strength and
the natural frequencies of the unperturbed parts, but also on the energy to
which the system can access. These regimes additionally discriminate the
completely different behaviors of several static physical properties, namely
the total number of excitations, the photon statistics of the field, and the
cavity-qubit entanglement. Finally, we explain the dynamical properties which
are traditionally associated to the deep strong coupling regime, such as the
collapses and revivals of the state population, in the frame of the proposed
spectral classification.

outward progression in dust location from the L'-band to the H-band (VLT/SPHERE
image) to the visible (HST/STIS image), likely indicative of dust blowout. The
warm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST
NICMOS in 1999 (respectively at 406 and 245 AU). We fit our new L'-band image
and spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer
code MCFOST. Our best-fit models favor pure olivine grains, and are consistent
with the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative
very-faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not
detect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the first
outer ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.

In order to assess the importance of additional angular momentum transport
mechanisms other than rotation, we compare the asteroseismic properties of a
uniformly rotating model and a differentially rotating one. Accordingly, we
employ the observed period spacing of 36 dipole g-modes in the Kepler $\sim3.2$
M$_\odot$ target KIC 7760680 to discriminate between these two models. We favor
the uniformly rotating model, which fully satisfies all observational
constraints. Therefore, efficient angular momentum transport by additional
mechanisms such as internal gravity waves, heat-driven modes and magnetic field
is needed during early main sequence evolution of massive stars.

atomic counterpart. The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest
interaction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the
coupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit
atom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored
this situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)
type multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy
points. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive
and which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant
renormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key
quantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state
entangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when
the coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very
large couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly
equal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic
states are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state. We interpret
the emergence of the two-fold degeneracy of the vacuum of both circuits as an
environmental suppression of flux/charge tunneling due to their dressing by
virtual low-/high-impedance photons in the resonator. For flux tunneling, the
dressing is nothing else than the shunting of a Josephson atom with a large
capacitance of the resonator. Suppression of charge tunneling is a
manifestation of the dynamical Coulomb blockade of transport in tunnel
junctions connected to resistive leads.

to those of other Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Since AbuseHUB members
together comprise over 90 percent of the broadband market in the Netherlands,
it also makes sense to compare how the country as a whole has performed
compared to other countries. This report complements the baseline measurement

accepted theory of the evolution of real world communication networks. Careful
comparison of the theory with a wide range of real world networks, however,
indicates that the model is in some cases, only a rough approximation to the
dynamical evolution of real networks. In particular, the exponent $\gamma$ of
the power law distribution of degree is predicted by the model to be exactly 3,
whereas in a number of real world networks it has values between 1.2 and 2.9.
In addition, the degree distributions of real networks exhibit cut offs at high
node degree, which indicates the existence of maximal node degrees for these
networks. In this paper we propose a simple extension to the `Scale Free'
model, which offers better agreement with the experimental data. This
improvement is satisfying, but the model still does not explain \emph{why} the
attachment probabilities should favor high degree nodes, or indeed how
constraints arrive in non-physical networks. Using recent advances in the
analysis of the entropy of graphs at the node level we propose a first
principles derivation for the `Scale Free' and `constraints' model from
thermodynamic principles, and demonstrate that both preferential attachment and

The combined effect of these processes is an economy in which organismal growth

model for the co-evolving dynamics of metabolite concentrations, production
regulation, and population frequencies for the case of two cell types, each
requiring and capable of producing two metabolites. In this model, beneficial
trade relations emerge without any coordination, via individual-level
production decisions that maximize each cell's growth rate given its perceived
environment. As we vary production parameters of the model, we encounter three
paradoxical behaviors, where a change that should intuitively benefit some cell
type, actually harms it. (1) If a cell type is more efficient than its
counterpart at producing a metabolite and becomes even more efficient, its
frequency in the population can decrease. (2) If a cell type is less efficient
than its counterpart at producing a metabolite but becomes less inefficient,
the growth rate of the population can decrease. (3) Finally, if a cell type
controls its counterpart's production decisions so as to maximize its own
growth rate, the ultimate growth rate it achieves can be lower than if the two
cell types each maximized their own growth. These three paradoxes highlight the
complex and counter-intuitive dynamics that emerge in simple microbial

that are much larger than the lattice size, enabling low-frequency vibration
attenuation. Typically, bandgap analyses and predictions rely on the assumption
of traveling waves in an infinite medium, and do not take advantage of modal
representations typically used for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of
finite structures. Recently, we developed a method for understanding the
locally resonant bandgap in uniform finite metamaterial beams using modal
analysis. Here we extend that framework to general locally resonant
metastructures with specified boundary conditions using a general operator
formulation. Using this approach, along with the assumption of an infinite
number of resonators tuned to the same frequency, the frequency range of the
locally resonant bandgap is easily derived in closed form. Furthermore, the
bandgap expression is shown to be the same regardless of the type of vibration
problem under consideration, depending only on the added mass ratio and target
frequency. It is shown that the number of resonators required for the bandgap
to appear increases with the target frequency range, i.e. respective modal
neighborhood. Furthermore, it is observed that there is an optimal, finite
number of resonators which gives a bandgap that is wider than the
infinite-absorber bandgap, and that the optimal number of resonators increases
with target frequency and added mass ratio. As the number of resonators becomes
sufficiently large, the bandgap converges to the derived infinite-absorber
bandgap. The derived bandgap edge frequencies are shown to agree with results
from dispersion analysis using the plane wave expansion method. Numerical and
experimental investigations are performed regarding the effects of mass ratio,

indistinguishable in frequency---a major challenge for systems experiencing
different local environments or of different physical compositions altogether.
Here we develop an entirely new platform which actually exploits such frequency
mismatch for processing quantum information. Labeled ""spectral linear optical
quantum computation"" (spectral LOQC), our protocol offers favorable linear
scaling of optical resources and enjoys an unprecedented degree of parallelism,
as an arbitrary $N$-qubit quantum gate may be performed in parallel on multiple
$N$-qubit sets in the same linear optical device. Not only does spectral LOQC
offer new potential for optical interconnects; it also brings the ubiquitous

Simulation results indicate that the bidirectional pumping increases the
instabilities threshold by a factor of 30% with respect to the co-pumped

temperature induced refractive index grating due to a more homogeneous pump
profile along the fiber length. This technique demonstrates that the

These data were analyzed in conjunction with existing CO and dust images. The
derived CH abundance is consistent with previous observations of translucent
clouds ($0.8\le A_{v} \le 2.1$ mag). The $X({\rm CH})$-factor is nearly a
constant at $(1.0\pm0.06)\times 10^{22}$ $\rm {cm^{-2}~K^{-1}~km^{-1}~s}$ in
this extinction range, with less dispersion than that of the more widely used
molecular tracers CO and OH. CH turns out be a better tracer of total column
density in such an intermediate extinction range than CO or OH. Compared with
previous observations, CH is overabundant below 1 mag extinction. Such an
overabundance of CH is consistent with the presence of a C-shock. CH has two
kinematic components, one of which shifts from 5.3 to 6 km s$^{-1}$, while the
other stays at 6.8 km s$^{-1}$ when moving from outside toward inside of the
cloud. These velocity behaviors exactly match with previous OH observation. The
shifting of the two kinematic components indicates colliding streams or gas
flow at the boundary region, which could be the cause of the C-shock.

$n$-bit source string $x$. An algorithm is given access to independent traces
of $x$, where a trace is formed by deleting each bit of~$x$ independently with
probability~$\delta$. The goal of the algorithm is to recover~$x$ exactly (with
high probability), while minimizing samples (number of traces) and running
time.
  Previously, the best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction problem was
due to Holenstein~et~al.; it uses $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ samples and
running time for any fixed $0 < \delta < 1$. It is also what we call a
""mean-based algorithm"", meaning that it only uses the empirical means of the
individual bits of the traces. Holenstein~et~al.~also gave a lower bound,
showing that any mean-based algorithm must use at least $n^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log
n)}$ samples.
  In this paper we improve both of these results, obtaining matching upper and
lower bounds for mean-based trace reconstruction. For any constant deletion
rate $0 < \delta < 1$, we give a mean-based algorithm that uses
$\exp(O(n^{1/3}))$ time and traces; we also prove that any mean-based algorithm
must use at least $\exp(\Omega(n^{1/3}))$ traces. In fact, we obtain matching
upper and lower bounds even for $\delta$ subconstant and $\rho := 1-\delta$
subconstant: when $(\log^3 n)/n \ll \delta \leq 1/2$ the bound is
$\exp(-\Theta(\delta n)^{1/3})$, and when $1/\sqrt{n} \ll \rho \leq 1/2$ the
bound is $\exp(-\Theta(n/\rho)^{1/3})$.
  Our proofs involve estimates for the maxima of Littlewood polynomials on
complex disks. We show that these techniques can also be used to perform trace
reconstruction with random insertions and bit-flips in addition to deletions.
We also find a surprising result: for deletion probabilities $\delta > 1/2$,
the presence of insertions can actually help with trace reconstruction.

  Intelligence",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an approach to capture the 3D motion of a group of people engaged
in a social interaction. The core challenges in capturing social interactions
are: (1) occlusion is functional and frequent; (2) subtle motion needs to be
measured over a space large enough to host a social group; (3) human appearance
and configuration variation is immense; and (4) attaching markers to the body
may prime the nature of interactions. The Panoptic Studio is a system organized
around the thesis that social interactions should be measured through the
integration of perceptual analyses over a large variety of view points. We
present a modularized system designed around this principle, consisting of
integrated structural, hardware, and software innovations. The system takes, as
input, 480 synchronized video streams of multiple people engaged in social
activities, and produces, as output, the labeled time-varying 3D structure of
anatomical landmarks on individuals in the space. Our algorithm is designed to
fuse the ""weak"" perceptual processes in the large number of views by
progressively generating skeletal proposals from low-level appearance cues, and
a framework for temporal refinement is also presented by associating body parts
to reconstructed dense 3D trajectory stream. Our system and method are the
first in reconstructing full body motion of more than five people engaged in
social interactions without using markers. We also empirically demonstrate the
impact of the number of views in achieving this goal.

particle physics experiments in high radiation environments, such as in the
ATLAS High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Since charge collection
by drift is mandatory for harsh radiation environment, the application of high

prototype of a DMAPS was fabricated in a 150nm CMOS process on a substrate with
a resistivity of >2 k{\Omega}cm that was thinned to 100 {\mu}m. Full depletion
occurs around 20V, which is far below the breakdown voltage of 110 V. A readout
chip has been attached for fast triggered readout. Presented prototype also
uses a concept of sub-pixel en/decoding three pixels of the prototype chip are

the largest concerns in DMAPS, the CCPD_LF chip has been irradiated with X-rays
and neutrons up to a total ionization dose of 50 Mrad and a fluence of
10E15neq/cm2, respectively.

  to Second Order Logic",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the framework of computable queries in Database Theory, there are many
examples of queries to (properties of) relational database instances that can
be expressed by simple and elegant third order logic ($\mathrm{TO}$) formulae.
In many of those properties the expressive power of $\mathrm{TO}$ is not
required, but the equivalent second order logic ($\mathrm{SO}$) formulae can be
very complicated or unintuitive. From the point of view of the study of highly
expressive query languages, it is then relevant to identify fragments of
$\mathrm{TO}$ (and, in general, of higher-order logics of order $\geq 3$) which
do have an $\mathrm{SO}$ equivalent formula. In this article we investigate
this precise problem as follows. Firstly, we define a general schema of
$\exists$TO formulas which consists of existentially quantifying a third-order
linear digraph of polynomial length, that is, a sequence of structures that
represents a computation, by explicitly stating which operations are the ones
which can be involved in the construction of a given structure in the sequence,
when applied to the previous one. Then we give a constructive proof of the fact
that all $\exists$TO sub formulas of that schema can be translated into an
equivalent SO formula. Secondly, aiming to formally characterize the fragment
of TO which can be translated to SO, we define a restriction of TO, which we
denote TO$^{P}$, for polynomial TO, and we give a constructive proof on the
fact that it collapses to SO. We define TO$^{P}$ as the fragment of TO where
valuations can assign to TO relation variables only TO relations whose
cardinalities are bounded by a polynomial that depends on the quantifier.
Moreover, we define a similar restriction for every higher order logic of order
$i \geq 4$, which we denote $\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$, and give a constructive proof
of the fact that for all $i \geq 4$, $\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$ collapses to SO.

high-temperature case (temperature $T$ larger than the level spacing $\Delta$)
and discuss both the classical (flux-independent) and interference
contributions to the tunneling conductance of the ring in the presence of
magnetic flux. We demonstrate that the SCS effects, which arise solely from the
electron-electron interaction, lead to the appearance of a peculiar fine
structure of the electron spectrum in the ring. Specifically, each level splits
into a series of sublevels, with their spacing governed by the interaction
strength. In the high-$T$ limit, the envelope of the series contains of the
order of $T/\Delta$ sublevels. At the same time, SCS suppresses the tunneling
width of the sublevels by a factor of $\Delta/T$. As a consequence, the
classical transmission through the ring remains unchanged compared to the
noninteracting case: the suppression of tunneling is compensated by the
increase of the number of tunneling channels. On the other hand, the
flux-dependent contribution to the conductance depends on the
interaction-induced dephasing rate which is known to be parametrically
increased by SCS in an infinite system. We show, however, that SCS is not
effective for dephasing in the limit of weak tunneling. Moreover, generically,
in the almost closed ring, the dephasing rate does not depend on the
interaction strength and is determined by the tunneling coupling to the leads.
In certain special symmetric cases, dephasing is further suppressed. Similar to
the spinless case, the high-$T$ conductance shows, as a function of magnetic
flux, a sequence of interaction-induced sharp negative peaks on top of the
classical contribution.

detected at IceCube, describing both the neutrino flux normalization and
spectral shape with moderate baryonic loadings. While the uncertainties on our

a suppression of Glashow resonance events.

respect to the first FAVA catalog, this catalog benefits from a larger data
set, the latest LAT data release (Pass 8), as well as from an improved analysis
that includes likelihood techniques for a more precise localization of the
transients. Applying this analysis on the first 7.4 years of \textit{Fermi}
observations, and in two separate energy bands 0.1$-$0.8 GeV and 0.8$-$300 GeV,
a total of 4547 flares has been detected with a significance greater than
$6\sigma$ (before trials), on the time scale of one week. Through spatial
clustering of these flares, 518 variable gamma-ray sources are identified.
Likely counterparts, based on positional coincidence, have been found for 441
sources, mostly among the blazar class of active galactic nuclei. For 77 2FAV
sources, no likely gamma-ray counterpart has been found. For each source in the
catalog, we provide the time, location, and spectrum of each flaring episode.
Studying the spectra of the flares, we observe a harder-when-brighter behavior
for flares associated with blazars, with the exception of BL Lac flares
detected in the low-energy band. The photon indexes of the flares are never
significantly smaller than 1.5. For a leptonic model, and under the assumption
of isotropy, this limit suggests that the spectrum of the freshly accelerated
electrons is never harder than $p\sim$2.

$dN\propto\exp(-j/\langle j\rangle)dj$. This distribution translates to a
surface-density profile that is generally not an exponential function of

for a rotation curve $v_c(R)$ and $R_e(R)\equiv\langle j\rangle/v_c(R)$. We

galaxies that exhibit population gradients cannot have fully reached a

gamma-rays observed in the inner regions of the Milky Way likely arises from a
population of sub-threshold point sources, and the NPTF has since found
additional applications studying sub-threshold extragalactic sources at high
Galactic latitudes. The NPTF generalizes traditional astrophysical template
fits to allow for the ability to search for populations of unresolved PSs that
may follow a given spatial distribution. NPTFit builds upon the framework of
the fluctuation analyses developed in X-ray astronomy, and thus likely has
applications beyond those demonstrated with gamma-ray data. The NPTFit package
utilizes novel computational methods to perform the NPTF efficiently. The code

span a diverse range. If they are formed predominantly in isolation by
gravitational collapse like dwarf stars then their compositions might follow
those of dwarf stars, spanning a relatively narrow range in metallicities (~
-0.4 to +0.4 dex) and predominantly oxygen-rich (C/O <~ 0.7). On the other
hand, giant planets in the solar system are all super-solar in metallicity
([C/H] > 0.5~dex), which is thought to be a consequence of formation by
core-accretion in a circumstellar disk. In this study we determine the
atmospheric chemical compositions of three brown dwarfs and find them to be
neither characteristic of dwarf stars nor giant planets. We derive
high-precision atmospheric chemical abundances using high-S/N HST near-infrared
spectra of three mid T Dwarfs which, together with two previously studied
objects, display distinctly sub-solar metallicities and span C/O ratios of
0.4-1.0. These abundance patterns indicate either an old sub-stellar population
and a multitude of formation environments or objects formed in circumstellar
disks followed by ejection later. We show that for a simple synthetic model
population of brown dwarfs with the same spectral-type as our sample the
predicted age distribution is predominantly older than the Sun and, hence, more
metal poor, consistent with our derived abundances. The diverse C/O ratios we
find are indicative of either different chemical reservoirs in their formation
environments or different formation pathways. Our results open the possibility
that cool brown dwarfs may provide important probes of early galactic chemical
evolution and inhomogeneity.

the extragalactic gamma-ray sky that is not resolvable into individual point
sources --- provides a powerful probe into the evolution of the high-energy
universe. Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are among the most likely contributors
to the IGRB, though their contribution is difficult to constrain because their
flux distribution is dominated by numerous faint sources. We produce a novel
joint-likelihood analysis of the $\gamma$-ray emission from 584 SFGs, utilizing
advanced statistical techniques to compare the distribution of low-significance
excesses against the non-Poissonian $\gamma$-ray background fluctuations. We
first examine the theoretically well-motivated relationship between the far-IR
and $\gamma$-ray luminosities of SFGs, utilizing a model where the $\gamma$-ray
luminosity is given by log$_{10}$(L$_\gamma$/(erg s$^{-1}$)) = $\alpha$
log$_{10}$(L$_{IR}$/(10$^{10}$L$_\odot$)) + $\beta$. We calculate best-fit
parameters $\alpha$ = 1.18 $\pm$ 0.15, $\beta$ = 38.49 $\pm$ 0.24, with a
log-normal dispersion in this relationship given by $\sigma$ = 0.39 $\pm$ 0.12.
The best-fit values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are consistent with previous
studies. We find a larger dispersion in the far-IR to $\gamma$-ray correlation
than previous studies. This dispersion is significant at the level of
5.7$\sigma$. These results imply that SFGs significantly contribute to the
IGRB, producing between 61.0$^{+30.2}_{-18.3}\%$ of the total IGRB intensity
above an energy of 1 GeV. Along with recent works, this strongly indicates that
multiple source classes provide comparable contributions to the IGRB intensity.
We discuss the implication of these results for the interpretation of the
IceCube neutrinos.

underlines the importance of phenomenological studies on ultraviolet
completions of the Twin Higgs model, which must lie at a scale lower than 5-10
TeV. We pursue this course in the context of non-supersymmetric completions,
focusing on exotic fermions that carry SM electroweak and twin color charges,
as well as on exotic vectors that transform as the bi-fundamental of the
electroweak or color groups. Both $Z_2$-preserving and $Z_2$-breaking mass

heavier than $\sim 1$ TeV, but can still be sizably produced in the decays of
the color bi-fundamental vector. In the $Z_2$-breaking scenario, the exotic
fermions can have masses in the few hundred GeV range without significantly
increasing the fine-tuning. Once pair-produced through the electroweak
interactions, they naturally form bound states held together by the twin color
force, which subsequently annihilate back to SM particles. The associated
resonance signals are discussed in detail. We also outline the phenomenology of
the electroweak bi-fundamental vectors, some of which mix with the SM $W$ and
$Z$ and can therefore be singly produced in hadron collisions.

when collisional ionization is the dominant ionization process. While
photoionization by the ultraviolet background (UVB) is a viable option, it
tends to predict large line-of-sight thickness for the absorbing gas. Here, we
study the implications of the recently updated UVB at low-z to understand the
ionization mechanisms of intervening Ne VIII absorbers. With the updated UVB,
one typically needs higher density and metallicity to reproduce the observed
ionic column densities under photoionization. Both reduce the inferred
line-of-sight thicknesses of the absorbers. We find a critical density of
$\geq5\times10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$ above which the observed N(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) can
be reproduced by pure collisional processes. If the gas is of near solar
metallicity (as measured for the low ions) then the cooling timescales will be
small (<$10^{8}$ yrs). Therefore, a continuous injection of heat is required in
order to enhance the detectability of the collisionally ionized gas. Using
photoionization models we find that in almost all Ne VIII systems the inferred
low ion metallicity is near solar or supersolar. If we assume the Ne VIII phase
to have similar metallicities then photoionization can reproduce the observed
N(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) without the line-of-sight thickness being unreasonably large
and avoids cooling issues related to the collisional ionization at these
metallicities. However the indication of broad Ly$\alpha$ absorption in a
couple of systems, if true, suggests that the Ne VIII phase is distinct from
the low ion phase having much lower metallicity.

use extinction-corrected rest-frame U-V colors to divide both AGN hosts and
non-AGN galaxies into red sequence (quiescent), green valley (transition), and
blue cloud (star-forming) populations. We find that both the AGN fraction at
fixed stellar mass and its evolution with redshift are dependent on host
colors. Most notably, red galaxies have the lowest AGN fraction (~5\%) at z~1
yet with most rapid redshift evolution, increasing by a factor of 5 (~24\%) at
z~2. Green galaxies exhibit the highest AGN fraction across all redshifts,
which is most pronounced at z~2 with more than half of them hosting an AGN at
$M_{*} > 10^{10.6} M_{\odot}$. Together with the high AGN fraction in red
galaxies at z~2, this indicates that X-ray AGNs could be important in both
transforming blue galaxies into red ones and subsequently maintaining their
quiescence at high redshift. Furthermore, consistent with low-redshift studies,
we find that the probability of hosting an AGN in the total galaxy population
can be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio ($p(\lambda_{Edd}) \sim
\lambda_{Edd}^{-0.4}$) and a moderate redshift evolution. Yet consistent with
their different AGN fractions, different populations appear to also have
different $p(\lambda_{Edd})$ with red galaxies exhibiting more rapid redshift
evolution than green and blue ones. Evidence for a steeper power law of
$p(\lambda_{Edd})$ in red galaxies is also presented, though larger samples are
needed to confirm. These results suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth
of supermassive black holes is related to their host properties, and may also
influence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host color.

obtained from different types of environments? Is there a direct relation
between the shape parameters of the void size distribution and the
environmental effects? In an attempt to answer these questions, we here find
that all void size distributions of these data samples satisfy the 3-parameter

log-normal void size distribution seem highly affected by environment,

relations given by linear equations between the skewness and the maximum tree

percentage of the voids with nonzero central density in the data sets has a
critical importance. If the number of voids with nonzero central densities
reaches greater and or equal to 3.84 percentage in a simulation/mock sample,
then a second population is observed in the void size distributions. This
second population emerges as a second peak in the log-normal void size

individual quantum state trajectories of the emitter conditioned on the
outcomes of the field measurements. We analyze the ensemble properties of these
trajectories by considering trajectories that connect specific initial and
final states. By applying the stochastic path integral formalism, we calculate
equations-of-motion for the most likely path between two quantum states and
compare these predicted paths to experimental data. Drawing on the mathematical
similarity between the action formalism of the most likely quantum paths and
ray optics we study the emergence of caustics in quantum trajectories---places
where multiple extrema in the stochastic action occur. We observe such multiple
most likely paths in experimental data and find these paths to be in reasonable
quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations.

service oriented computing for analysing the compliance between (contracts
exposed by) clients and servers or, more generally, between two peers. It has
however been argued that multiparty scenarios call for more permissive notions
of compliance because partners usually do not have full coordination
capabilities. We propose two new testing preorders, which are obtained by
restricting the set of potential observers. For the first preorder, called
uncoordinated, we allow only sets of parallel observers that use different
parts of the interface of a given service and have no possibility of
intercommunication. For the second preorder, that we call individualistic, we
instead rely on parallel observers that perceive as silent all the actions that
are not in the interface of interest. We have that the uncoordinated preorder
is coarser than the classical must testing preorder and finer than the
individualistic one. We also provide a characterisation in terms of decorated
traces for both preorders: the uncoordinated preorder is defined in terms of
must-sets and Mazurkiewicz traces while the individualistic one is described in
terms of classes of filtered traces that only contain designated visible
actions and must-sets.

the capacitor is given by the external electrostatic potential and the
capacitance is determined purely by geometry. Here we consider capacitively
driven motion of a nano-mechanical resonator with a low density of states, in
which these assumptions can break down. We find three leading-order corrections
to the classical picture: the first of is a modulation in the static force due
to variation in the internal chemical potential, the second and third are
change in static force and dynamic spring constant due to the rate of change of
chemical potential, expressed as the quantum (density of states) capacitance.
As a demonstration, we study a capacitively driven graphene mechanical
resonators, where the chemical potential is modulated independently of the gate
voltage using an applied magnetic field to manipulate the energy of electrons
residing in discrete Landau levels. In these devices, we observe large periodic
frequency shifts consistent with the three corrections to the classical
picture. In devices with extremely low strain and disorder, the first
correction term dominates and the resonant frequency closely follows the
chemical potential. The theoretical model fits the data with only one
adjustable parameter representing disorder-broadening of the Landau levels. The
underlying electromechanical coupling mechanism is not limited the particular
choice of material, geometry, or mechanism for variation in chemical potential,
and can thus be extended to other low-dimensional systems.

First, predict the state of spectrum through Markov prediction. Based on the
prediction results of state of spectrum, a spectrum aggregation strategy is
proposed. Simulation results show that the spectrum prediction process can
observably lower the outage rate, and the spectrum aggregation strategy can
greatly improve the network throughput.

permeability in granular rocks by accounting for the combined effect of
porosity changes, grain breakage and cement bond damage. To account for such a
broad range of microscopic processes under general loading paths, the Breakage
Mechanics theory is used and the computed mechanical response is linked with
the Kozeny equation, i.e. a permeability model able to evaluate the reduction
of the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity
and growth of surface area. In particular, the evolution of the internal
variables of the model has been linked to idealized geometric schemes at
particle scale, with the goal to distinguish the contribution of the fines
generated by the disaggregation of the cement matrix from that of the broken
fragments resulting from the crushing of the skeleton. Compression/flow
experiments available in the literature for different granular rocks are used
to validate the proposed methodology. The analyses illustrate that the drop of
the permeability of damaged rocks would be severely underestimated without an
accurate computation of the growth of surface area, as well as that the
distributed fragmentation of skeleton particles tends to have stronger
implications than the generation of cement fines. These findings, along with
the satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experiments, stress
the benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for the
analysis of coupled hydro-mechanical problems.

fit well to the present calculations of N-Au and S-Au donor-acceptor bonds,

distortions of two-dimensional materials, and that lattice distortions are
important for the nonlinear optical properties of such materials.

applicable to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval systems. Our
framework integrates algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and analyzing

variety of bibliographic data through natural language. A series of text- and
linguistic-based techniques are used to analyze and answer natural language
queries, including tokenization, named entity recognition, and syntactic

complex bibliographic information needs. Thus, the contributions of this paper
are as follows: First, to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose a
natural language interface to graph-based bibliographic information retrieval.
Second, we propose a novel customized natural language processing framework
that integrates a few original algorithms/heuristics for interpreting and
analyzing natural language bibliographic queries. Third, we show that the
proposed framework and natural language interface provide a practical solution

probability that the state magnitude remains bounded must go to zero with time.
Our proof technique recursively bounds the conditional density of the system
state (instead of focusing on the second moment) to bound the progress the
controller can make. This sidesteps the difficulty encountered in using the
standard data-rate theorem style approach; that approach does not work because
the mutual information per round between the system state and the observation
is potentially unbounded.
  It was known that a system with multiplicative observation noise can be
stabilized using a simple memoryless linear strategy if the system growth is
suitably bounded. In this paper, we show that while memory cannot improve the
performance of a linear scheme, a simple non-linear scheme that uses one-step

predictions for software projects. This problem is particular acute in
parametric effort models that give extra weight to size factors (for example,
the COCOMO model assumes that effort is exponentially proportional to project
size). Objective: To test if effort estimates are crippled by bad ESP. Method:
Document inaccuracies in early size estimates. Use those error sizes to
determine the implications of those inaccuracies via a Monte Carlo perturbation
analysis of effort models and an analysis of the equations used in those effort
models. Results: While many projects have errors in ESP of up to +/- 100%,
those errors add very little to the overall effort estimate error.
Specifically, we find no statistically significant difference in the estimation
errors seen after increasing ESP errors from 0 to +/- 100%. An analysis of
effort estimation models explains why this is so: the net additional impact of
ESP error is relatively small compared to the other sources of error associated
with in estimation models. Conclusion: ESP errors effect effort estimates by a
relatively minor amount. As soon as a model uses a size estimate and other
factors to predict project effort, then ESP errors are not crippling to the
process of estimation

large-scale structures called vertically sheared horizontal flows (VSHFs).
VSHFs emerge in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) stratified
turbulence with similar vertical structure. The mechanism responsible for VSHF
formation is not fully understood. In this work, the formation and
equilibration of VSHFs in a 2D Boussinesq model of stratified turbulence is
studied using statistical state dynamics (SSD). In SSD, equations of motion are
expressed directly in the statistical variables of the turbulent state.
Restriction to 2D turbulence makes available an analytically and
computationally attractive implementation of SSD referred to as S3T, in which
the SSD is expressed by coupling the equation for the horizontal mean structure
with the equation for the ensemble mean perturbation covariance. This second
order SSD produces accurate statistics, through second order, when compared
with fully nonlinear simulations. In particular, S3T captures the spontaneous
emergence of the VSHF and associated density layers seen in simulations of
turbulence maintained by homogeneous large-scale stochastic excitation. An
advantage of the S3T system is that the VSHF formation mechanism, which is
wave-mean flow interaction between the emergent VSHF and the stochastically
excited large-scale gravity waves, is analytically understood in the S3T
system. Comparison with fully nonlinear simulations verifies that S3T solutions
accurately predict the scale selection, dependence on stochastic excitation
strength, and nonlinear equilibrium structure of the VSHF. These results
facilitate relating VSHF theory and geophysical examples of turbulent jets such
as the ocean's equatorial deep jets.

regression functionals can be defined by minimizing objective functions or
solving estimating equations at joint $\xy$ distributions. In this framework it
is possible to achieve the following: (1)~define a notion of well-specification
for regression functionals that replaces the notion of correct specification of

important role in predicting the nature of order-disorder transition. We also

hydrodynamic equations of motion with an introduction of a density dependent

comparison with a random matrix ensemble which interpolates between Poisson

interpolates between Poisson (f=0) and GOE statistics (f=1). It turns out to be
f~0.9. This is so far the closest agreement with GOE observed in spectra of
bound states in a nucleus. The same analysis has also been performed with

multi-emitter systems. The subradiant PB is a new interference effect owing to
the inhomogeneous broadening of the emitters which results in a purer and a
more robust single photon emission than the polaritonic PB. The unconventional
PB in the modeled system corresponds to the suppression of the single- and
two-photon correlation statistics and the enhancement of the three-photon
correlation statistic. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we unravel the
origin and the time-domain evolution of these phenomena.

Debrecen Data (HMIDD), and the SOHO/MDI Debrecen Data. For comparison, we also
compiled an additional sunspot catalogue, the Greenwich Photoheliographic Data,
from the digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory images for the 1974-76. By
comparing these catalogues when they overlap in time, we can investigate how
various factors influence the measured area of the sunspots, and, in addition,
we can derive area cross-calibration factors for these catalogues.The main
findings are as follows. The poorer seeing increases the individual corrected
spot areas and decreases the number of the small spots. Interestingly, the net
result of these two effects for the total corrected spot area is zero. DPD
daily total corrected sunspot areas are 5 per cent smaller than the HMIDD ones.
Revised DPD daily total corrected umbra areas are 9 per cent smaller than those
of HMIDD. The Greenwich Photoheliographic Result areas are only a few per cent
smaller than DPD areas. A $0.2^{\circ}$ difference between the North directions
of the DPD and MDI images is found. This value is nearly the same as that was
found ($0.22^{\circ}$) by us in a previous paper comparing HMI and MDI images.
The Solar Observing Optical Network area measurement practice (spots smaller
than $10 mh$ were not directly measured but an area of $2 mh$ were assigned to

infection, degree of endemicity, and the burden on human health---provide an
essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets.
Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling
approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available
measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is
that of Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework comprised of two
components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple
independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal
shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have
been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance
function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple
linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex
interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved
modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here we
present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalisation that allows for
multiple, non-linear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within
the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium
falciparum prevalence data in Sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalised
ensemble approach markedly out-performs any individual method.

of this quantity and the relative fraction of light mesons and glueballs
observed in hadronic processes. Here we develop a technique for defining a
configurational entropy for an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. The achieved
result corroborates consistency with the Hawking-Page phase transition. Namely,
the dominance of the black hole configurational entropy will be shown to
increase with the temperature. In order to verify the consistency of the new
procedure developed here, we also consider the case of black holes in flat
space-time. For such a black hole, it is known that evaporation leads to
instability. The configurational entropy obtained for the flat space case is
thoroughly consistent with the physical expectation. In fact, we show that the
smaller the black holes, the more unstable they are. So, the configurational
entropy furnishes a reliable measure for stability of black holes.

dipole- and quadrupole-type components of the magnetic field in the solar cycle

result, we found that there are two different attractors of the solar cycle, in

activity and the polar field reversal without any ad hoc source of asymmetry.

Data drawn from such a population will exhibit extra variability relative to
any single subpopulation. Statistical models based on finite mixtures can
assist in the analysis of categorical and count outcomes when standard
generalized linear models (GLMs) cannot adequately account for variability
observed in the data. We propose an extension of GLM where the response is
assumed to follow a finite mixture distribution, while the regression of
interest is linked to the mixture's mean. This approach may be preferred over a
finite mixture of regressions when the population mean is the quantity of
interest; here, only a single regression function must be specified and
interpreted in the analysis. A technical challenge is that the mean of a finite
mixture is a composite parameter which does not appear explicitly in the
density. The proposed model is completely likelihood-based and maintains the
link to the regression through a certain random effects structure. We consider
typical GLM cases where means are either real-valued, constrained to be
positive, or constrained to be on the unit interval. The resulting model is
applied to two example datasets through a Bayesian analysis: one with
success/failure outcomes and one with count outcomes. Supporting the extra
variation is seen to improve residual plots and to appropriately widen
prediction intervals.

donor and the acceptor. The enzyme's impact on the dynamics is modelled by an
additional energetic term, an oscillatory contribution known as ""gating"". By
varying two key parameters, the gating frequency and the mean donor-acceptor
separation, the model is able to reproduce well the KIE data for SLO wild-type
and a variety of SLO mutants over the experimentally accessible temperature
range. While SLO-specific constants have been considered here, it is possible
to adapt these for other enzymes.

of superconductor nanowire to a permanent normal state, decreasing the
switching current. In this letter, we propose an improved impedance matching
circuit that releases the transition triggered by phase slips to the load
resistor through the RF port of a bias tee. The transportation properties with
different load resistors indicate that the switching current decreases due to
the reflection caused by impedance mismatching, and is maximized by optimized
impedance matching. Compared to the same setup without impedance matching
circuit, the switching current was increased from 8.0 micro A to 12.2 micro A
in a niobium nitride nanowire after releasing the temporary transition
triggered by phase slips. The leakage process with impedance matching outputs a
voltage pulse which enables the user to directly register the transition
triggered by phase slips. The technique for maximizing the switching current
has potential practical application in superconductor devices, and the
technique for counting phase slips may be applied to explore the quantum
behavior of phase slips.

and machine learning for modeling heterogeneity in data for regression,
classification and clustering. MoE for continuous data are usually based on the
normal distribution. However, it is known that for data with asymmetric
behavior, heavy tails and atypical observations, the use of the normal
distribution is unsuitable. We introduce a new robust non-normal mixture of
experts modeling using the skew $t$ distribution. The proposed skew $t$ mixture
of experts, named STMoE, handles these issues of the normal mixtures experts
regarding possibly skewed, heavy-tailed and noisy data. We develop a dedicated
expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to estimate the model
parameters by monotonically maximizing the observed data log-likelihood. We
describe how the presented model can be used in prediction and in model-based
clustering of regression data. Numerical experiments carried out on simulated
data show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model in fitting
non-linear regression functions as well as in model-based clustering. Then, the
proposed model is applied to the real-world data of tone perception for musical
data analysis, and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate
change data. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of the model for
practical data analysis applications.

possible evolutionary paths that often are not deterministic. Occasionally,
some map routs form over the course of time which guide systems towards some
particular states. The main intention of this study is to discover an indicator
that can help predict these pseudo-deterministic paths in advance. Here we
investigate the dynamics of networks based on Heider balance theory that states
the tendency of systems towards decreasing tension. This inclination leads
systems to some local and global minimum tension states called ""jammed states""
and ""balanced states"", respectively. We show that not only paths towards jammed
states are not completely random but also there exist secret pseudo
deterministic paths that bound the system to end up in these special states.
Our results display that the Inverse Participation Ratio method (IPR) can be a
suitable indicator that exhibits collective behaviors of systems. According to
this method, these specific paths are those that host the most participation of
the constituents in the system. A direct proportionality exists between the
distance and the selectable paths towards local minimums; where by getting
close to the final steps there is no other way but the one to the jammed
states.
