tools for the study of brain connectivity. These methods require the definition
of a graph, which is typically derived by estimating the effective connectivity
between brain regions through the optimization of an ill-posed inverse problem.
Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of methods extracting
sparse connectivity graphs. The present paper aims at highlighting the benefits
of an alternative ap- proach. We investigate low-rank L2 regularized matrices
recently intro- duced under the denomination of Riccati regularized precision
matrices. We demonstrate their benefits for the analysis of cortical thickness
map and for the extraction of functional biomarkers from resting state fMRI
scans. In addition, we explain how speed and result quality can be further
improved with random projections. The promising results obtained using the
Human Connectome Project dataset as well as the numerous possi- ble extensions
and applications suggest that Riccati precision matrices might usefully
complement current sparse approaches.

large stable oscillations are caused by supercritical Hopf bifurcations of the
equilibrium states of the Lotka-Volterra (LV) models for dynamics of soliton
amplitudes. The predictions of the LV models are confirmed by numerical
simulations with the coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) propagation

understood as the difference between the empirical output of an experiment and
its statistical prediction, is a measure of such uncertainty. One of the great
contributions of noise appeared in 1905 when Einstein showed how the noisy
(Brownian) motion of a dust particle seen in a microscope provided
uncontroversial evidences on the existence of the (unseen) atoms. The aim of
this special issue is to provoke discussions on how noise can help us to better

into the phase behavior of the deeply cooled water confined in a nanoporous
silica material, MCM-41, with elastic neutron scattering technique. Under such
strong confinement, the homogeneous nucleation process of water is avoided,
which allows the confined water to keep its liquid state at temperatures and
pressures that are inaccessible to the bulk water. By measuring the average
density of the confined heavy water, we observe a likely first-order
low-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) transition in the deeply
cooled region of the confined heavy water. The phase separation starts from
1.12 +- 0.17 kbar and 215 +- 1K and extends to higher pressures and lower
temperatures in the phase diagram. This starting point could be the
liquid-liquid critical point of the confined water. The locus of the Widom line
is also estimated. The observation of the liquid-liquid transition in the
confined water has potential to explain the mysterious behaviors of water at
low temperatures. In addition, it may also have impacts on other disciplines,
because the confined water system represents many biological and geological
systems in which water resides in nanoscopic pores or in the vicinity of
hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces.

beliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth
state meaning \emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of
uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits
borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a
compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents
apply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence
restriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with
each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus
operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are
influenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the
former we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief
updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of
assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible
they are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus
operators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which
is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus
formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is
closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only
changed as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent
interactions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true
state of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the
population converging to a high quality shared belief.

convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ which we call $\text{dep}_\mathcal{F}$. We begin
showing that $\text{dep}_\mathcal{F}$ satisfies some expected properties for a
measure of depth and that this definition is closely related to the notion of
depth proposed by J. Tukey. We show that some properties of Tukey depth extend
to $\text{dep}_\mathcal{F}$ and we point out some key differences.
  We then focus on the following centerpoint-type question: what is the best
depth $\alpha_{d,k}$ that we can guarantee under the hypothesis that the family
$\mathcal{F}$ is $k$-intersecting? We show a key connection between this
problem and a purely combinatorial problem on hitting sets. The relationship is
useful in both directions. On the one hand, for values of $k$ close to $d$ the
combinatorial interpretation gives a good bound for $k$. On the other hand, for
low values of $k$ we can use the classic Rado's centerpoint theorem to get
combinatorial results of independent interest. For intermediate values of $k$
we present a probabilistic framework to improve the bounds and illustrate its
use in the case $k\approx d/2$. These results can be though of as an
interpolation between Helly's theorem and Rado's centerpoint theorem.
  As an application of these results we find a Helly-type theorem for

one electron of the helium atom at its ionic ground state and the motion of the
second electron in the ion core is treated via a more general case of screened
Coulomb potential model. Using the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) unitary
transformation, which is semiclassical counterpart of the Block-Nordsieck
transformation in the quantized field formalism, the squared vector potential
that appears in the equation of motion is eliminated and the resultant equation
is expressed in KH frame. Within this frame, the resulting potential and the
corresponding wave function have been expanded in Fourier series and using
Ehlotzkys approximation, we obtain a laser-dressed potential to simulate
intense laser field. By fitting the more general case of screened Coulomb
potential model into the laser-dressed potential, and then expanding it in
Taylor series up to $\mathcal{O}(r^4,\alpha_0^9)$, we obtain the solution
(eigenvalues and wave function) of an electron of Helium atom under the
influence of external electric field and high-intensity laser field, within the
framework of perturbation theory formalism. We found that the variation in
frequency of laser radiation has no effect on the eigenvalues of an electron of

for a very strong external electric field and an infinitesimal screening

limit object, called ""partitioned subprobability measure"", to describe the
limits of endpoint distributions of directed polymers. Inspired by a recent
work of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of
Brownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned
subprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact. Then using a
variant of the cavity method from the theory of spin glasses, we show that any
limit law of a sequence of endpoint distributions must satisfy a fixed point
equation on this abstract space, and that the limiting free energy of the model
can be expressed as the solution of a variational problem over the set of fixed
points. As a first application of the theory, we prove that in an environment
with finite exponential moment, the endpoint distribution is asymptotically
purely atomic if and only if the system is in the low temperature phase. The
analogous result for a heavy-tailed environment was proved by Vargas in 2007.
As a second application, we prove a subsequential version of the longstanding
conjecture that in the low temperature phase, the endpoint distribution is
asymptotically localized in a region of stochastically bounded diameter. All
our results hold in arbitrary dimensions, and make no use of integrability.

by introducing a MAC layer modeling methodology based on time- and space-domain

the steady-state performance in infinite one-dimensional (1-D) CSMA networks

that: 1) under the assumption of fixed frame duration, if the conditional
channel access probability at each station exceeds a certain threshold, the
CSMA system enters the status of ""synchronized transmissions"", where a large
number of adjacent stations transmit in overlap and interfere each other
resulting in null system goodput. 2) The maximum system goodput of CSMA
broadcast communication increases with increased station density but becomes
increasingly sensitive to the conditional channel access probability. In [25]

attention thanks to their excellent performance in practical applications. A
prominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by
Elhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency
matrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the
other data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the
dimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC
quickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-OMP obtained by
replacing the Lasso by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm
results in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding
comparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical
performance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce
and analyze the SSC-MP algorithm, which employs matching pursuit (MP) in lieu
of OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces
intersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The
clustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for
SSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to
Heckel and B\""olcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results
indicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion
automatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data.
Moreover, experiments on synthetic and on real data show that SSC-MP compares
very favorably to SSC, SSC-OMP, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor
algorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time. In
addition, we find that, in contrast to SSC-OMP, the performance of SSC-MP is
very robust with respect to the choice of parameters in the stopping criteria.

hypersurface is governed by a wave equation derived as the result of a
canonical quantization process. To find physically interesting solutions of the
wave equation we employ the separation of variables by considering a temporal
eigenvalue problem which has a complete countable set of eigenfunctions with
positive eigenvalues and also a spatial eigenvalue problem which has a complete
set of eigendistributions. Assuming that the Cauchy hypersurface is
asymtotically Euclidean we prove that the temporal eigenvalues are also spatial
eigenvalues and the product of corresponding eigenfunctions and
eigendistributions, which will be smooth functions with polynomial growth, are
the physically interesting solutions of the wave equation. We consider these
solutions to describe the quantum development of the Cauchy hypersurface.

their parental compounds possess antiferromagnetic(AFM) Mott insulating states
through pure superexchange interactions and the low energy physics near Fermi

functions used to capture the de- sired behavior and constraints of a robot.
Usually, these are handcrafted by a expert designer and represent heuristics
for relatively simple tasks. Real world applications typically involve more
complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structure. In this paper we take
advantage of the expressive power of temporal logic (TL) to specify complex
rules the robot should follow, and incorporate domain knowledge into learning.
We propose Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL) as specifications language,
that is arguably well suited for the robotics applications, together with
quantitative semantics, i.e., robustness degree. We propose a RL approach to
learn tasks expressed as TLTL formulae that uses their associated robustness
degree as reward functions, instead of the manually crafted heuristics trying
to capture the same specifications. We show in simulated trials that learning
is faster and policies obtained using the proposed approach outperform the ones
learned using heuristic rewards in terms of the robustness degree, i.e., how
well the tasks are satisfied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed RL
approach in a toast-placing task learned by a Baxter robot.

between the SNR and the molecular cloud at $V_LSR\sim 105$ km s$^{-1}$. We
revisit the 380 ks XMM-Newton observations and perform a dedicated spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopic study with careful background subtraction. The
overall X-ray-emitting gas is characterized by an under-ionized ($\tau_c \sim
6\times 10^{11}$ cm^${-3}$) cool ($kT_c \approx 0.20$ keV) plasma with solar
abundances, plus an under-ionized ($\tau_h\sim 8\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$) hot

Kes 79 appears to have a double-hemisphere morphology viewed along the

the thermal composite morphology. The X-ray filaments, spatially correlated

occurred within a short interval of time (less than 4 hours), showed very
similar plasma morphology and were all confined, until the last one when a
large-scale eruption occurred. The C-class flares are characterized by the
appearance, at approximatively the same locations, of two bright and compact
footpoint sources of $\approx$~3--10~MK evaporating plasma, and a semi-circular
ribbon. During all the flares, the continuous brightening of a spine-like hot
plasma ($\approx$~10~MK) structure is also observed. Spectroscopic observations
with Hinode/EIS are used to measure and compare the blueshift velocities in the

for each flare. Similar velocities, of the order of 150--200~km~s$^{-1}$, are
observed during the C2.0 and C4.7 confined flares, in agreement with the values

observed in flares with lower peak soft X-ray flux.In order to investigate the
homologous nature of the flares, we performed a Non-Linear Force-Free Field

NLFFF extrapolation and the Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) provide the magnetic
field context which explains the location of the kernels, spine-like and
semi-circular brightenings observed in the (non-eruptive) flares. Given the
absence of a coronal null point, we argue that the homologous flares were all

enables the time delay between the direct path arrival and the first multipath

proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the joint

the individual frames recorded from its micro-channel-plate (MCP) intensified
charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. One way to overcome this limitation is to
use photons that arrive during the frame transfer of the CCD, forming vertical
read-out streaks for bright sources. We calibrate these read-out streaks for
photometry of bright sources observed with XMM-OM. The bright source limit for
read-out streak photometry is set by the recharge time of the MCPs. For XMM-OM
we find that the MCP recharge time is 0.55 ms. We determine that the effective
bright limits for read-out streak photometry with XMM-OM are approximately 1.5
magnitudes brighter than the bright source limits for normal aperture
photometry in full-frame images. This translates into bright-source limits in
Vega magnitudes of UVW2=7.1, UVM2=8.0, UVW1=9.4, U=10.5, B=11.5, V=10.2 and
White=12.5 for data taken early in the mission. The limits brighten by up to
0.2 magnitudes, depending on filter, over the course of the mission as the
detector ages. The method is demonstrated by deriving UVW1 photometry for the
symbiotic nova RR Telescopii, and the new photometry is used to constrain the
e-folding time of its decaying UV emission. Using the read-out streak method,
we obtain photometry for 50 per cent of the missing UV source measurements in

MOA, OGLE, Wise, RoboNET/LCOGT, MiNDSTEp and $\mu$FUN groups. All analyses of
the light curve data favour a lens system comprising a planetary mass orbiting
a host star. The most favoured binary lens model has a mass ratio between the
two lens masses of $(4.78 \pm 0.13)\times 10^{-3}$. Subject to some important
assumptions, a Bayesian probability density analysis suggests the lens system
comprises a $3.09_{-1.12}^{+1.02}$ M_jup planet orbiting a
$0.62_{-0.22}^{+0.20}$ M_sun host star at a deprojected orbital separation of
$4.40_{-1.46}^{+2.16}$ AU. The distance to the lens system is
$2.22_{-0.83}^{+0.96}$ kpc. Planet OGLE-2014-BLG-0676Lb provides additional
data to the growing number of cool planets discovered using gravitational
microlensing against which planetary formation theories may be tested. Most of
the light in the baseline of this event is expected to come from the lens and
thus high-resolution imaging observations could confirm our planetary model
interpretation.

molecular orbitals are variationally optimized in the presence of the

addressing the major difference between them. The similarity between ECISD and

investigate the excess entropy production under quasistatic operations between
nonequilibrium steady states. The average entropy production is composed of the
time integral of the instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the
excess entropy production. We propose to define average entropy production rate
using the average energy and particle currents, which are calculated by using
the full counting statistics with QME. The excess entropy production is given
by a line integral in the control parameter space and its integrand is called
the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime,
we show that BSN vector is described by $\ln \breve{\rho}_0$ and $\rho_0$ where
$\rho_0$ is the instantaneous steady state of the QME and $\breve{\rho}_0$ is
that of the QME which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. If
the system Hamiltonian is non-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible,
the excess entropy production approximately reduces to the difference between
the von Neumann entropies of the system. Additionally, we point out that the
expression of the entropy production obtained in the classical Markov jump
process is different from our result and show that these are approximately
equivalent only in the weakly nonequilibrium regime.

integrating multiple/step-wise evidence to make a final perceptual judgment.
(iii) the multi-task learning, which is believed to be an effectual means to
shape representation learning and could result in a more generalized model.
  To exploit the synergy of the three, we consider the NR-IQA as a dynamic
perception process, in which the model samples a sequence of ""informative""
areas and aggregates the information to learn a representation for the tasks of
jointly predicting the image quality score and the distortion type.
  The model learning is implemented by a reinforcement strategy, in which the
rewards of both tasks guide the learning of the optimal sampling policy to
acquire the ""task-informative"" image regions so that the predictions can be
made accurately and efficiently (in terms of the sampling steps). The
reinforcement learning is realized by a deep network with the policy gradient
method and trained through back-propagation.
  In experiments, the model is tested on the TID2008 dataset and it outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model is very efficient in
the sense that a small number of fixations are used in NR-IQA.

calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the
thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer BiTeBr including both the
electron and phonon transports. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for the electron part, and GGA for
the phonon part. It is found that SOC has important effects on electronic
transport coefficients because of SOC-induced obvious influences on energy band
structures. In p-type doping, monolayer has larger Seebeck coefficient than
bulk in wide doping range, which is beneficial to excellent thermoelectric
performance. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity of bulk is
1.71 $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ at room temperature, which is close to
experimental value 1.3 $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$. Calculated results show that
monolayer has better $ZT_e$ and lower lattice thermal conductivity than bulk,
which suggests that monolayer has better thermoelectric performance than bulk.
The lower lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer than bulk is due to shorter
phonon lifetimes. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of bulk
with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 3.3 $\times$
$10^{-14}$ s. Based on electron and phonon transport coefficients, the
thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ of bulk and monolayer are calculated. It is
found that monolayer has higher peak $ZT$ than bulk, and the peak $ZT$ of
monolayer can be as high as 0.55 in n-type doping and 0.75 in p-type doping at

reductions have not been sustained. We develop a compartmental model of scabies
infection dynamics and incorporate both ovicidal and non-ovicidal treatment
regimes. By including the dynamics of mass drug administration, we are able to
reproduce the phenomena of an initial reduction in prevalence, followed by the
recrudescence of infection levels in the population. We show that even under a
`perfect' two-round MDA, eradication of scabies under a non-ovicidal treatment
scheme is almost impossible. We then go on to consider how the probability of
elimination varies with the number of treatment rounds delivered in an MDA. We
find that even with infeasibly large numbers of treatment rounds, elimination

backscattering under normal incidence and the presence of a conical band
structure, the wave localization behaviors are entirely different from those of
normal disordered systems. We show both numerically and analytically that there
exists a critical strength of random potential ($W_c$), which is equal to the
incident energy ($E$), below which the localization length $\xi$ decreases with
the random strength $W$ for a fixed incident angle $\theta$. But the
localization length drops abruptly to a minimum at $W=W_c$ and rises
immediately afterwards, which has never been observed in ordinary materials.
The incidence angle dependence of the localization length has different
asymptotic behaviors in two regions of random strength, with $\xi \propto
\sin^{-4}\theta$ when $W<W_c$ and $\xi \propto \sin^{-2}\theta$ when $W>W_c$.
Experimentally, for a given disordered sample with a fixed randomness strength
$W$, the incident wave with incident energy $E$ will experience two different
types of localization, depending on whether $E>W$ or $E<W$. The existence of a
sharp transition at $E=W$ is due to the emergence of evanescent waves in the
systems when $E<W$. Such localization behavior is unique to pseudospin-1
systems. For pseudospin-1/2 systems, there is a minimum localization length as
randomness increases, but the transition from decreasing to increasing
localization length at the minimum is smooth rather than abrupt. In both
decreasing and increasing regions, the $\theta$ -dependence of the localization
length has the same asymptotic behavior $\xi \propto \sin^{-2}\theta$.

issue ignore the global similarity among positive instances and that negative
instances are non-i.i.d., usually resulting in the detection of TPI not precise
and sensitive to outliers. To the end, we propose a positive instance detection
via graph updating for multiple instance learning, called PIGMIL, to detect TPI
accurately. PIGMIL selects instances from working sets (WSs) of some working
bags (WBs) as positive candidate pool (PCP). The global similarity among
positive instances and the robust discrimination of instances of PCP from
negative instances are measured to construct the consistent similarity and
discrimination graph (CSDG). As a result, the primary goal (i.e. TPI detection)
is transformed into PCP updating, which is approximated efficiently by updating
CSDG with a random walk ranking algorithm and an instance updating strategy. At
last bags are transformed into feature representation vector based on the
identified TPIs to train a classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
high precision of PIGMIL's detection of TPIs and its excellent performance

materials with unusually strong light-matter interaction, have attracted much
recent attention. In contrast to the initial understanding, the minima of the
conduction band are predicted to be spin split. Because of this splitting and
the spin-polarized character of the valence bands, the lowest-lying excitonic
states in WX2 (X=S, Se) are expected to be spin-forbidden and optically dark.
To date, however, there has been no direct experimental probe of these dark
band-edge excitons, which strongly influence the light emission properties of
the material. Here we show how an in-plane magnetic field can brighten the dark
excitonic states and allow their properties to be revealed experimentally in
monolayer WSe2. In particular, precise energy levels for both the neutral and
charged dark excitons were obtained and compared with ab-initio calculations
using the GW-BSE approach. Greatly increased emission and valley lifetimes were
observed for the brightened dark states as a result of their spin
configuration. These studies directly probe the excitonic spin manifold and
provide a new route to tune the optical and valley properties of these
prototypical two-dimensional semiconductors.

assessing changes in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR). However, as the U5MR
decreases, the share of neonatal deaths (within the first month) tends to
increase, warranting increased efforts in monitoring this indicator in addition
to the U5MR. A Bayesian splines regression model is presented for estimating
neonatal mortality rates (NMR) for all countries. In the model, the
relationship between NMR and U5MR is assessed and used to inform estimates, and
spline regression models are used to capture country-specific trends. As such,
the resulting NMR estimates incorporate trends in overall child mortality while
also capturing data-driven trends. The model is fitted to 195 countries using
the database from the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality
Estimation, producing estimates from 1990, or earlier if data are available,
until 2015. The results suggest that, above a U5MR of 34 deaths per 1000 live
births, at the global level, a 1 per cent increase in the U5MR leads to a 0.6
per cent decrease in the ratio of NMR to U5MR. Below a U5MR of 34 deaths per
1000 live births, the proportion of deaths under-five that are neonatal is
constant at around 54 per cent. However, the relationship between U5MR and NMR
varies across countries. The model has now been adopted by the United Nations
Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.

various statistical tools. We find that the effects of E-to-B leakage are
negligible for the $\mathcal{B}$-mode power spectrum, as well as the skewness
and kurtosis analyses of $\mathcal{B}$-maps. However, if employing the
morphological statistical tools, including Minkowski functionals and/or Betti

level, which shows that in the morphological analysis, the leakage can play a
significant role as a contaminant for measuring the primordial B-mode signal

ignoring the much faster selection of symbiotic bacteria. Here we take
host-symbiont interactions into account by introducing a Population
Genetics-like model of holobionts exposed to toxic stress. The stress can be
alleviated by selection of resistant individuals (host and bacteria) and by
secretion of a detoxification agent (""detox""). By defining a new measure,
termed the Lamarckian, we show that selection of resistant bacteria over one
generation of hosts leads to stress-dependent increase in the tolerance of the
host's offspring. This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and
physiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by 'group
selection' of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium. These
findings show that Lamarckian adaptation can arise via interactions between two
levels of Darwinian selection within a holobiont system. The conclusions and

work we consider a simplified model problem of a 3d-1d coupling and the main
objective is to construct algorithms that may utilize stan- dard multilevel

complexity. Preconditioning for a system of two elliptic problems posed,
respectively, in a three dimensional domain and an embedded one dimensional

numerically the properties of the well-defined discrete trace operator, it is
found that negative fractional Sobolev norms are suitable preconditioners for
the Schur complement of the sys- tem. The norms are employed to construct a

spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the

vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and
subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small
adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly
attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped
and attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble
into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct
assembly pathways induced only by a short ranged membrane-particle adhesion,
shows that a cellular cytoskeleton or other active components are not required
for microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated
microparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of
polymer microparticles in organisms.

heat engines and the quantum regime of thermal devices composed from a single
element. We compile recent studies of the quantum Otto cycle with a harmonic
oscillator as a working medium. This model has the advantage that it is
analytically trackable. In addition, an experimental realization has been
achieved employing a single ion in a harmonic trap. The review is embedded in
the field of quantum thermodynamics and quantum open systems. The basic
principles of the theory are explained by a specific example illuminating the
basic definitions of work and heat. The relation between quantum observables
and the state of the system is emphasized. The dynamical description of the
cycle is based on a completely positive map formulated as a propagator for each
stroke of the engine. Explicit solutions for these propagators are described on
a vector space of quantum thermodynamical observables. These solutions which
employ different assumptions and techniques are compared. The tradeoff between
power and efficiency is the focal point of finite-time-thermodynamics. The
dynamical model enables to study finite time cycles limiting time on the
adiabtic and the thermalization times. Explicit finite time solutions are found
which are frictionless, meaning that no coherence is generated also known as
shortcuts to adiabaticity. The transition from frictionless to sudden adiabats
is characterized by a non-hermitian degeneracy in the propagator. In addition
the influence of noise on the control is illustrated. These results are used to
close the cycles either as engines or as refrigerators.

interest in a broader, usually quantified manner. Due to the rapidly increasing
body of knowledge in software engineering, researchers who want to capture the
published work in a domain often face an extensive amount of publications,
which need to be screened, rated for relevance, classified, and eventually
analyzed. Although there are several guidelines to conduct literature studies,
they do not yet help researchers coping with the specific difficulties
encountered in the practical application of these guidelines. In this article,
we present an experience-based guideline to aid researchers in designing
systematic literature studies with special emphasis on the data collection and
selection procedures. Our guideline aims at providing a blueprint for a
practical and pragmatic path through the plethora of currently available
practices and deliverables capturing the dependencies among the single steps.
The guideline emerges from various mapping studies and literature reviews
conducted by the authors and provides recommendations for the general study
design, data collection, and study selection procedures. Finally, we share our

exponentially in response to weak changes of the twist angle. Such a large
sensitivity makes theoretical predictions of the gap nearly impossible, since
experimentally the twist angle is always known with finite accuracy. To address
this issue, we numerically study finite clusters of twisted bilayer graphene.
For finite systems, changing the twist angle causes a gradual crossover between
gapless and gapped regimes. The crossover occurs when the finite-size
quantization energy becomes comparable to the matrix elements responsible for
the generation of the gap. We further argue that disorder scattering can induce
similar crossover, in which the mean-free path plays the same role as the
system size for the finite clusters. It is demonstrated that, to observe the
gap experimentally, it is necessary to have a sample of suitable purity, and to
possess the ability to tune the twist angle accurately.

the intrinsic dimensionality of object representations of DNN neurons. Our

analytic techniques are required to access the chemistry of these materials at
a nanometric scale. Electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning
transmission electron microscope can provide the suitable resolution, but GO
and RGO are extremely sensitive to electron irradiation. In this work we employ
a dedicated experimental setup to reduce electron illumination below damage
limit. GO oxygen maps obtained at a few nanometers scale show separated domains
with different oxidation levels. The C/O ratio varies from about 4:1 to 1:1,
the latter corresponding to a complete functionalization of the graphene
flakes. In RGO the residual oxygen concentrates mostly in regions few tens
nanometers wide. Specific energy-loss near-edge structures are observed for
different oxidation levels. By combining these findings with first-principles
simulations we propose a model for the highly oxidized domains where graphene
is fully functionalized by hydroxyl groups forming a 2D-sp$^3$ carbon network

properties of polarity alignment in interacting cellular units, where each cell
is described by a reaction-diffusion system and the cells further interact with
one another through their proximal surfaces. The system behavior is shown to be
strongly dependent on geometric properties such as cell alignment and cell
shape. Using a perturbative method under the assumption of weak coupling
between cells, we derive a reduced model in which each cell is described by
just one variable, the phase. The reduced model resembles an XY model but
contains novel terms that possesses geometric information, which enables the
understanding of the geometric dependencies as well as the effects of external
signal and noise. The model is simple, generic, and analytically and
numerically tractable, and is therefore expected to facilitates studies on
cellular polarity alignment in various nonequilibrium systems.

interpretation is realized by a global envelope which is drawn jointly for all
samples of functions. If a mean function computed from the empirical data is
out of the given envelope, the null hypothesis is rejected with the
predetermined significance level $\alpha$. The advantages of the proposed
one-way functional ANOVA are that it identifies the domains of the functions
which are responsible for the potential rejection. We introduce two versions of
this test: the first gives a graphical interpretation of the test results in
the original space of the functions and the second immediately offers a
post-hoc test by identifying the significant pair-wise differences between
groups. The proposed tests rely on discretization of the functions, therefore
the tests are also applicable in the multidimensional ANOVA problem. In the
empirical part of the article, we demonstrate the use of the method by
analyzing fiscal decentralization in European countries. The aim of the
empirical analysis is to capture differences between the levels of government
expenditure decentralization ratio among different groups of European
countries. The idea behind, based on the existing literature, is
straightforward: countries with a longer European integration history are
supposed to decentralize more of their government expenditure. We use the
government expenditure centralization ratios of 29 European Union and EFTA
countries in period from 1995 to 2016 sorted into three groups according to the
presumed level of European economic and political integration.

static gravitational potential and the wave function of the photon, we propose
a variant of a conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show that the
predicted relative phase difference of $10^{-5}$ radians is measurable even in
the presence of fiber noise, provided additional stabilization techniques are
implemented for each arm of a large-scale fiber interferometer. Effects arising
from the rotation of the Earth and the material properties of the fibers are

the most important parameters. This efficiency directly relates to the capacity
of the electrical energy storage that is needed for the launch. In this study,
the rail/armature contact behavior for two different armature technologies was
compared. To this end, experiments using aluminum c-shaped armature and copper
brush armature type projectiles were performed under same initial conditions.
The c-shaped armature type showed a superior behavior with respect to
electrical contact to the rails and in acceleration. A 300 g projectile with a
c-shaped armature reached a velocity of 3100 m/s and an overall launch
efficiency including the power supply of 41%. This is to be compared to 2500
m/s and 23% for the launching of a projectile using a brush armature.

  Oct. 2016",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-based methods pervade the inference toolkits of numerous disciplines
including sociology, biology, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and
engineering. A challenging problem encountered in this context pertains to
determining the attributes of a set of vertices given those of another subset
at possibly different time instants. Leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics can
drastically reduce the number of observed vertices, and hence the cost of
sampling. Alleviating the limited flexibility of existing approaches, the
present paper broadens the existing kernel-based graph function reconstruction
framework to accommodate time-evolving functions over possibly time-evolving
topologies. This approach inherits the versatility and generality of
kernel-based methods, for which no knowledge on distributions or second-order
statistics is required. Systematic guidelines are provided to construct two
families of space-time kernels with complementary strengths. The first
facilitates judicious control of regularization on a space-time frequency
plane, whereas the second can afford time-varying topologies. Batch and online
estimators are also put forth, and a novel kernel Kalman filter is developed to
obtain these estimates at affordable computational cost. Numerical tests with
real data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
competing alternatives.

activities, such as updating features or fixing bugs, is to have a relatively
good understanding of the program's source code which is often written by other
developers. A code summary is a description about a program's entities (e.g.,
its methods) which helps developers have a better comprehension of the code in
a shorter period of time. However, generating code summaries can be a
challenging task. To mitigate this problem, in this article, we introduce
CrowdSummarizer, a code summarization platform that benefits from the concepts
of crowdsourcing, gamification, and natural language processing to
automatically generate a high level summary for the methods of a Java program.
We have implemented CrowdSummarizer as an Eclipse plugin together with a
web-based code summarization game that can be played by the crowd. The results
of two empirical studies that evaluate the applicability of the approach and
the quality of generated summaries indicate that CrowdSummarizer is effective
in generating quality results.

both for engineering novel states such as Majorana zero-energy modes and for
probing bulk properties of the superconducting state. The high-temperature
cuprates offer a clear advantage in a much larger superconducting order
parameter, but the nodal energy spectrum of a pure $d$-wave superconductor only
allows virtual bound states. Fully gapped $d$-wave superconducting states have
however been proposed in several cuprate systems thanks to subdominant order
parameters producing $d+is$- or $d+id'$-wave superconducting states. Here we
study both magnetic and potential impurities in these fully gapped $d$-wave
superconductors. Using analytical T-matrix and complementary numerical
tight-binding lattice calculations, we show that magnetic and potential
impurities behave fundamentally different in $d+is$- and $d+id'$-wave
superconductors. In a $d+is$-wave superconductor, there are no bound states for
potential impurities, while a magnetic impurity produces one pair of bound
states, with a zero-energy level crossing at a finite scattering strength. On
the other hand, a $d+id'$-wave symmetry always give rise to two pairs of bound

range of applications using photonic hardware, and constitutes a

single photons or classical light have precision which is limited by
shot-noise, while quantum resources can be used to achieve sub-shot-noise
precision. However, there are many open questions with regard to the best
quantum protocols for multi-parameter estimation, including the ultimate limits
to achievable precision, as well as optimal choices for probe states and
measurements. In this paper, we develop a formalism based on Fisher information
to tackle these questions for set-ups based on linear-optical components and
photon-counting measurements. A key ingredient of our analysis is a mapping for
equivalent protocols defined for photonic and spin systems, which allows us to
draw upon results in the literature for general finite-dimensional systems.

and the radial velocity of 43 stars, complemented by magnetic data from the
literature for 41 additional stars. Stars with resolved magnetically split
lines represent a significant fraction, of the order of several percent, of the
whole population of Ap stars. Most of them are genuine slow rotators, whose
consideration provides new insight into the long-period tail of the
distribution of the periods of the Ap stars. Emerging correlations between
rotation periods and magnetic properties provide important clues for the
understanding of the braking mechanisms that have been at play in the early
stages of stellar evolution. The geometrical structures of the magnetic fields
of Ap stars with magnetically resolved lines appear in general to depart
slightly, but not extremely, from centred dipoles. However, there are a few
remarkable exceptions, which deserve further consideration. We suggest that
pulsational crossover can be observed in some stars; if confirmed, this would
open the door to the study of non-radial pulsation modes of degree $\ell$ too
high for photometric or spectroscopic observations. How the lack of short
orbital periods among binaries containing an Ap component with magnetically
resolved lines is related with their (extremely) slow rotation remains to be
fully understood, but the very existence of acorrelation between the two
periods lends support to the merger scenario for the origin of Ap stars.

that $\underline{\mathcal{C}}$ is equivalent to the category $R$-mod of all
left $R$-modules of finite length. We also construct an abelian category of
$R$-modules, $R$-$\widetilde{\rm mod}$, which is hereditary, has enough
projectives, and contains $R$-mod as a Serre subcategory; this yields a more
conceptual proof of the main result of [loc. cit.], asserting that
$\underline{\mathcal{C}}$ is hereditary. We show that $R$-$\widetilde{\rm mod}$
is equivalent to the isogeny category of commutative quasi-compact $k$-group
schemes.

facilities that allows to provide brilliant beams of higher energy photons for
user experiments. Another useful application of harmonic lasing is so called
Harmonic Lasing Self-Seeded Free Electron Laser (HLSS FEL) that allows to
improve spectral brightness of these facilities. In the past, harmonic lasing
has been demonstrated in the FEL oscillators in infrared and visible wavelength
ranges, but not in high-gain FELs and not at short wavelengths. In this paper
we report on the first evidence of the harmonic lasing and the first operation
of the HLSS FEL at the soft X-ray FEL user facility FLASH in the wavelength
range between 4.5 nm and 15 nm. Spectral brightness was improved in comparison
with Self-Amplified Spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL by a factor of six in the
exponential gain regime. A better performance of HLSS FEL with respect to SASE
FEL in the post-saturation regime with a tapered undulator was observed as
well. The first demonstration of harmonic lasing in a high-gain FEL and at
short wavelengths paves the way for a variety of applications of this new
operation mode in X-ray FELs.

little work exists on systematically comparing the security performance of

processes 75 temperature sensors mainly located in the focal plane and also
distributed inside the camera-head electronics. It monitors the signals from
two pressure sensors, one humidity sensor as well as the connectivity to
sixteen low-voltage and two high-voltage cables. The master SIB supervises the
signals to and from external equipments like the cooling system, pressure
gauge, power crates and status information from experimental environment. SIB
is an 8-layer printed-circuit board (PCB) with a micro-controller sitting on
top as its central processing unit. A decision-matrix software reads the sensor
status continuously and determines whether the camera is in a safe state or
not. All error and warnings flags are sent to the detector control software
framework and the end user directly. These flags are also stored every 100 ms
together with the image data. The full SIB sensor data is sent to the back end
for offline analysis. A shutdown sequence is initiated by SIB in case of a
critical failure. The safety-interlock philosophy, hardware design, and
software architecture along with test results will be presented.

characteristics of the network and the nonlinear stability of single nodes with
respect to large but realistic perturbations. We extend previous results on
these relations by incorporating sampling-based measures of the transient
behaviour of the system, its survivability, as well as its asymptotic
behaviour, its basin stability. By combining basin stability and survivability
we uncover novel, previously unknown asymptotic states with solitary,
desynchronized oscillators which are rotating with a frequency different from
their natural one. They occur almost exclusively after perturbations at nodes
with specific topological properties.
  More generally we confirm and significantly refine the results on the
distinguished role tree-shaped appendices play for nonlinear stability. We find
a topological classification scheme for nodes located in such appendices, that
exactly separates them according to their stability properties, thus
establishing a strong link between topology and dynamics. Hence, the results
can be used for the identification of vulnerable nodes in power grids or other
coupled oscillator networks. From this classification we can derive general
design principles for resilient power grids. We find that striving for
homogeneous network topologies facilitates a better performance in terms of
nonlinear dynamical network stability. While the employed second-order
Kuramoto-like model is parametrized to be representative for power grids, we
expect these insights to transfer to other critical infrastructure systems or
complex network dynamics appearing in various other fields.

changes to the electric grid: more transmission lines, a flexibilisation of the
demand and grid scale energy storage. Liquid metal batteries (LMBs) are
considered these days as a promising means of stationary energy storage. Built
as a stable density stratification of two liquid metals separated by a liquid
salt, LMBs have three main advantages: a low price, a long life-time and
extremely high current densities. In order to be cheap, LMBs have to be built
large. However, battery currents in the order of kilo-amperes may lead to
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, which - in the worst case - may
short-circuit the thin electrolyte layer. The metal pad roll instability, as
known from aluminium reduction cells, is considered as one of the most
dangerous phenomena for LMBs. We develop a numerical model, combining fluid-
and electrodynamics with the volume-of-fluid method, to simulate this
instability in cylindrical LMBs. We explain the instability mechanism similar
to that in aluminium reduction cells and give some first results, including
growth rates and oscillation periods of the instability.

directly related to the value of the standard map parameter $K$. A detailed
numerical description is achieved in the present paper. More precisely, for
large values of $K$, the Lyapunov exponents are neatly positive over virtually
the entire phase space, and, consistently with Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics,
we verify $q_{\text{ent}}=q_{\text{sen}}=q_{\text{stat}}=q_{\text{rel}}=1$,

\equiv k \frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ (with $S_1=S_{BG} \equiv
-k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$) grows linearly with time before achieving its
$W$-dependent saturation value; $q_{\text{sen}}$ characterizes the time
increase of the sensitivity $\xi$ to the initial conditions, i.e., $\xi \sim
e_{q_{\text{sen}}}^{\lambda_{q_{\text{sen}}}

$q_{\text{stat}}$ is the index associated with the $q_{\text{stat}}$-Gaussian

$q_{\text{rel}}$-exponential relaxation with time of the entropy
$S_{q_{\text{ent}}}$ towards its saturation value. In remarkable contrast, for
small values of $K$, the Lyapunov exponents are virtually zero over the entire
phase space, and, consistently with $q$-statistics, we verify
$q_{\text{ent}}=q_{\text{sen}}=0$, $q_{\text{stat}} \simeq 1.935$, and

research is focused on its special case, the top-1 error. In this work, we
explore two directions that shed more light on the top-k error. First, we
provide an in-depth analysis of established and recently proposed single-label
multiclass methods along with a detailed account of efficient optimization
algorithms for them. Our results indicate that the softmax loss and the smooth
multiclass SVM are surprisingly competitive in top-k error uniformly across all
k, which can be explained by our analysis of multiclass top-k calibration.
Further improvements for a specific k are possible with a number of proposed
top-k loss functions. Second, we use the top-k methods to explore the
transition from multiclass to multilabel learning. In particular, we find that
it is possible to obtain effective multilabel classifiers on Pascal VOC using a
single label per image for training, while the gap between multiclass and
multilabel methods on MS COCO is more significant. Finally, our contribution of
efficient algorithms for training with the considered top-k and multilabel loss

quality factor Q, there remains a discrepancy between conventional estimates
and the latest determination that has been derived from astrometric
observations of Saturn's inner satellites. If dissipation in Saturn is as large
as the astrometric observations suggest, conventional models predict that
Mimas' initial orbit should be located inside Saturn's synchronous orbit or
even inside its Roche limit. Using simple structure models and assuming
Saturn's core to be viscoelastic, we look for dissipation models which are
consistent with both the latest astrometric observations and with Mimas'
orbital migration. Firstly, using a two-layer model of Saturn's interior
structure, we constrain the ranges of rigidity and viscosity of Saturn's core
which are consistent with Saturn's dissipation derived from astrometric
observations at the tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione. Next,
within the constrained viscosity and rigidity ranges, we calculate Mimas'
semi-major axis considering the frequency dependence of viscoelastic
dissipation in Saturn's core. By the two calculations, we evaluate (1)
Saturnian models which can explain the astrometrically determined Saturnian
dissipation, and (2) whether Mimas' initial semi-major axis is larger than the
synchronous orbit. We show that if the core is assumed to be solid with a
viscosity of 10^{13}-10^{14} Pa s, the lower boundary of the observed Saturnian
dissipation at tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione can be
explained by our model. In this viscosity range, Mimas can stay outside the
synchronous orbit and the Roche limit for 4.5 billion years of evolution. In
the case of a frequency dependent viscoelastic dissipative core, the lower
boundary of the observed Saturnian dissipation can be consistent with the
orbital expansion of Mimas.

two kind of sensitivity indices are linked by a Poincar\'e type inequality,

removable logarithmic singularities at low frequencies and are arbitrarily
shaped at higher frequencies. The singularities consist in arbitrarily positive
or negative powers of logarithmic functions, as additional factors for the
power laws of the Ohmic-like SDs. If the SD vanishes sufficiently fast at high
frequencies the short time behavior of the BCF is algebraic. The long time
behavior of the BCF exhibits a variety of relaxations that involve inverse
power laws and arbitrary powers of logarithmic forms. The imaginary part of the
BCF shows over long times regular dependence on the low frequency structure of
the SD, except for certain conditions where the ohmicity parameter takes odd
natural values. Same dependence holds for the real part of the BCF at
non-vanishing temperatures. At zero temperature the real part of the BCF
exhibits over long times the same regular relationship with the low frequency
structure of the SD, except for certain conditions involving even natural
values of the ohmicity parameter. The exceptional conditions provide
relaxations that are faster than those obtained via the regular dependence. In
this way, various long time relaxations of the BCF that are slower than
exponential decays and arbitrarily faster or slower than inverse power laws,
can be interpreted in terms of removable logarithmic singularities in the low
frequency structure SD of an open quantum system.

<= 0.1 Lsun is investigated by means of numerical modeling coupling the core
collapse simulations with the stellar evolution calculations. The gravitational
collapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Msun is
investigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and
terminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass
had been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk
formation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,
while the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a
stellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto
the star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted
energy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion
wherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein
all accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs
depend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid
accretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first
hydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.
In the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high
photospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the
contrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar
evolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets
the floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold
accretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are
relatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded
phase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Msun. (abridged).

spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry prior to inflation generated an

the defect is inside the horizon, and is frozen by causality if the defect
exits the horizon. After inflation, the phase-corresponding boson field started
to oscillate, when the Hubble rate decreased to a level comparable to the mass
of the boson field. The energy density of the newly created boson particles
varied across the observable universe. The bosons subsequently decayed into
radiation prior to the BBN epoch, and the resulting fluctuations in the energy
density produced the observed power asymmetry. This scenario predicts a
scale-dependent modulation amplitude power asymmetry and in addition, as
topological defects created by phase transitions are a very general phenomenon,
the observed hemispherical asymmetry may be seen as an evidence for the
cosmological inflation.

method which produces a nonlinear decision boundary in a feature space by
constructing linear boundaries in a transformed Hilbert space. It is well known
that these algorithms when executed on a classical computer do not scale well
with the size of the feature space both in terms of data points and
dimensionality. One of the most significant limitations of classical algorithms
using non-linear kernels is that the kernel function has to be evaluated for
all pairs of input feature vectors which themselves may be of substantially
high dimension. This can lead to computationally excessive times during
training and during the prediction process for a new data point. Here, we
propose using both canonical and generalized coherent states to rapidly
calculate specific nonlinear kernel functions. The key link will be the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property for SVMs that naturally arise
from canonical and generalized coherent states. Specifically, we discuss the
fast evaluation of radial kernels through a positive operator valued measure
(POVM) on a quantum optical system based on canonical coherent states. A
similar procedure may also lead to fast calculations of kernels not usually
used in classical algorithms such as those arising from generalized coherent
states.

magnetization of the barriers a fractional charge can be trapped in the dot via
the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism, the system we analyze offers the opportunity to
study the interplay between this noninteracting charge fractionalization and
the fractionalization due to two-particle backscattering. In this context, we
demonstrate that the number of fractional oscillations of the charge density
depends on the magnetization angle. Finally, we address the renormalization
induced by two-particle backscattering on the spin density, which is
characterized by a dominant oscillation, sensitive to the Jackiw-Rebbi charge,
with a wavelength twice as large as the charge density oscillations.

which conditions ""trion-polariton"" can exist. Dipolar attraction can bind an
exciton and an electron into a trion having an energy well separated from the
exciton energy. Yet, the existence of long-lived ""trion-polariton"" is a priori
implausible not only because the photon-trion coupling, which scales as the
inverse of the sample volume, is vanishingly small, but mostly because this
coupling is intrinsically ""weak"". Here, we show that a moderately dense Fermi
sea renders its observation possible: on the pro side, the Fermi sea overcomes
the weak coupling by pinning the photon to its momentum through Pauli blocking,
it also overcomes the dramatically poor photon-trion coupling by providing a
volume-linear trion subspace to which the photon is coherently coupled. On the
con side, the Fermi sea broadens the photon-trion resonance due to the
fermionic nature of trions and electrons, it also weakens the trion binding by
blocking electronic states relevant for trion formation. As a result, the
proper way to observe this novel polariton is to use doped semiconductor having
long-lived electronic states, highly-bound trion and Fermi energy as large as a
fraction of the trion binding energy.

Universe generically biases these observables, mainly due to peculiar

the notion of average which corresponds to the observation of the Hubble

deeply affects direct estimations of the evolution of the dark-energy equation

results of a multi-wavelength observing program, focusing on a sample of
WISE/SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) broad-line quasars at z~1.5-5. The
WISSH quasars project has been designed to reveal the most energetic AGN-driven
outflows, estimate their occurrence at the peak of quasar activity and extend
the study of correlations between outflows and nuclear properties up to
poorly-investigated extreme AGN luminosities (L_Bol~10^47 -10^48 erg/s). We
present NIR, long-slit LBT/LUCI1 spectroscopy of five WISSH quasars at
z~2.3-3.5 showing prominent [OIII] emission lines with broad (FWHM~1200-2200
km/s) and skewed profiles. The luminosities of the broad [OIII] wings are the
highest measured so far (L_[OIII]^broad >~5x10^44 erg/s) and reveal the
presence of powerful ionised outflows with mass outflow rates Mdot >~1700
M_Sun/yr and kinetic powers Edot >~10^45 erg/s. Although these estimates are
affected by large uncertainties, due to the use of [OIII] as tracer of ionized
outflows and the very basic outflow model we assume, these results suggest that
the AGN is highly efficient in pushing outwards large amounts of ionised gas in
our targets. The mechanical outflow luminosities for WISSH quasars correspond
to higher fractions (~1-3%) of L_Bol than those derived for lower L_Bol AGN.
Our targets host very massive (M_BH>~2x10^9 M_Sun) black holes which are still
accreting at a high rate (i.e. a factor of ~0.4-3 of the Eddington limit).
These findings demonstrate that WISSH quasars offer the opportunity of probing
the extreme end of both luminosity and SMBH mass functions and revealing
powerful ionised outflows able to affect the evolution of their host galaxies.

independence polynomial I(G;x) is the generating function of independent sets

or DMA attacks to extract sensitive data from the RAM. In response, several
main-memory encryption schemes have been proposed to prevent such attacks. Also
hardware vendors have acknowledged the threat and already announced respective
hardware extensions. Intel's SGX and AMD's SME will provide means to encrypt
parts of the RAM to protect security-relevant assets that reside there.
Encrypting the RAM will protect the user's content against passive
eavesdropping. However, the level of protection it provides in scenarios that
involve an adversary who is not only able to read from RAM but can also change
content in RAM is less clear. Obviously, encryption offers some protection
against such an ""active"" adversary: from the ciphertext the adversary cannot
see what value is changed in the plaintext, nor predict the system behaviour
based on the changes. But is this enough to prevent an active adversary from
performing malicious tasks? This paper addresses the open research question
whether encryption alone is a dependable protection mechanism in practice when
considering an active adversary. To this end, we first build a software based
memory encryption solution on a desktop system which mimics AMD's SME.
Subsequently, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept fault attack on this system, by
which we are able to extract the private RSA key of a GnuPG user. Our work
suggests that transparent memory encryption is not enough to prevent active
attacks.

Specifically, the cache ability introduced by SBS enables SBS to eliminate the

alleviates the wireless backhual traffic congestion from SBS to a macro base
station (MBS), but also improves the transmission efficiency of SBS. We then
investigate the scheduling schemes of SBS to offload more data traffic under

cache-limited region, are established to reveal the fundamental tradeoff
between the delay tolerance and the cache ability. Finally, numerical results

become dominant constraints in designing these massive multicore chips causing
issues with reliability, timing variations and reduced lifetime of the chips.
Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) is a solution to avoid high temperatures on
the die. Typical DTM schemes only address core level thermal issues. However,
the Network-on-chip (NoC) paradigm, which has emerged as an enabling
methodology for integrating hundreds to thousands of cores on the same die can
contribute significantly to the thermal issues. Moreover, the typical DTM is
triggered reactively based on temperature measurements from on-chip thermal
sensor requiring long reaction times whereas predictive DTM method estimates
future temperature in advance, eliminating the chance of temperature overshoot.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used in various domains for
modeling and prediction with high accuracy due to its ability to learn and
adapt. This thesis concentrates on designing an ANN prediction engine to
predict the thermal profile of the cores and Network-on-Chip elements of the
chip. This thermal profile of the chip is then used by the predictive DTM that
combines both core level and network level DTM techniques. On-chip wireless
interconnect which is recently envisioned to enable energy-efficient data
exchange between cores in a multicore environment, will be used to provide a
broadcast-capable medium to efficiently distribute thermal control messages to

constructed a 3D grid on which a small fraction of randomly chosen grid points
are acting as AS. In particular, we study how a large number of test particles
evolve inside a collection of AS, analyzing the evolution of their energy
distribution and their escape time distribution. We use a well established
method to estimate the transport coefficients directly from the trajectories of
the particles. Using the estimated transport coefficients and solving the
Fokker-Planck (FP) equation numerically, we can recover the energy distribution

the ambient particle distribution as predicted by \citet{Parker58} and

combine ENZO cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with a Lagrangian

suggest that the distribution of obliquities in galaxy clusters is random to
first order. Quasi-perpendicular shocks are able to accelerate cosmic-ray
electrons to the energies needed to produce observable radio emission. However,
the $\gamma$-ray emission is lowered by a factor of a few, $\sim$3, if
cosmic-ray protons are only accelerated by quasi-parallel shocks, reducing (yet
not entirely solving) the tension with the non-detection of hadronic
$\gamma$-ray emission by the \textit{Fermi}-satellite.

There is an amplified feedback mechanism in the brain called reentry which

material-dependent. In particular, the silver nanocrystals significantly
overcome the case of gold for the quantum rates of hot-electron generation.
Another important factor is the size of a nanocrystal. Small nanocrystals are
more efficient for the hot-electron generation since they exhibit stronger
quantum surface effects. The results of this study can useful for designing
novel material systems for solar photocatalytic applications.

  the Test Case section",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Prandtl Plus scaling parameters are reexamined theoretically. The flow
governing equations approach is used to examine similarity issues of the inner
region of wall-bounded turbulent flows as well as laminar flow cases. It is
found that the Prandtl Plus parameters are in fact similarity scaling
parameters for laminar sink flow but NOT the more general laminar Falkner-Skan
boundary layer flows. For turbulent boundary layer flows along a wall, it is
found that only turbulent sink flows show similarity with the Prandtl Plus
scaling parameters. This is diametrically opposed to the accepted notion that
the Prandtl Plus parameters work for every wall-bounded turbulent flow. To
correct the problem with the Prandtl Plus parameters, we introduce a new set of
scaling parameters that work for the Falkner-Skan boundary layer flows and
satisfy the relevant part of the flow governing equations approach to
similarity.

present both a theoretical and experimental characterization of such pumps. In
order to examine volume flow rate, we have developed a mathemati- cal model

membrane and hydrodynamic resistance of the microfluidic channel have been

physical parameters of the pump and allows the estimation of their impact on
the resulting flow. The model has been validated experimentally.

  contamination",,,,,"stat.AP math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radiological characterization of contaminated elements (walls, grounds,
objects) from nuclear facilities often suffers from a too small number of
measurements. In order to determine risk prediction bounds on the level of
contamination, some classic statistical methods may then reveal unsuited as
they rely upon strong assumptions (e.g. that the underlying distribution is
Gaussian) which cannot be checked. Considering that a set of measurements or
their average value arise from a Gaussian distribution can sometimes lead to
erroneous conclusion, possibly underconservative. This paper presents several
alternative statistical approaches which are based on much weaker hypotheses
than Gaussianity. They result from general probabilistic inequalities and
order-statistics based formula. Given a data sample, these inequalities make it
possible to derive prediction intervals for a random variable, which can be
directly interpreted as probabilistic risk bounds. For the sake of validation,
they are first applied to synthetic data samples generated from several known
theoretical distributions. In a second time, the proposed methods are applied
to two data sets obtained from real radiological contamination measurements.

(MCC) has been receiving increasing attention due to its robust against

algorithm without any priori information on the noise characteristics, is
proposed under the MCC. The proposed algorithm is useful for adaptive
beamforming, when the desired signal is contaminated by the impulsive noises.
Moreover, the analysis of convergence property of the CRMC algorithm is
performed. The results obtained from simulation study establish the
effectiveness of this new beamformer.

community as a building block for constructing metamaterials. However, the
primary focus has been placed on their kinematic applications, such as
deployable space structures and sandwich core materials, by leveraging the
compactness and auxeticity of planar origami platforms. Here, we present
volumetric origami cells -- specifically triangulated cylindrical origami (TCO)
-- with tunable stability and stiffness, and demonstrate their feasibility as
non-volatile mechanical memory storage devices. We show that a pair of origami
cells can develop a double-well potential to store bit information without the
need of residual forces. What makes this origami-based approach more appealing
is the realization of two-bit mechanical memory, in which two pairs of TCO
cells are interconnected and one pair acts as a control for the other pair.
Using TCO-based truss structures, we present an experimental demonstration of
purely mechanical one- and two-bit memory storage mechanisms.
