computations are prohibitively expensive but sampling from the model is
possible. Several so-called likelihood-free methods have been developed to
perform inference in the absence of a likelihood function. The popular
synthetic likelihood approach infers the parameters by modelling summary
statistics of the data by a Gaussian probability distribution. In another
popular approach called approximate Bayesian computation, the inference is
performed by identifying parameter values for which the summary statistics of
the simulated data are close to those of the observed data. Synthetic
likelihood is easier to use as no measure of `closeness' is required but the
Gaussianity assumption is often limiting. Moreover, both approaches require
judiciously chosen summary statistics. We here present an alternative inference
approach that is as easy to use as synthetic likelihood but not as restricted
in its assumptions, and that, in a natural way, enables automatic selection of
relevant summary statistic from a large set of candidates. The basic idea is to
frame the problem of estimating the posterior as a problem of estimating the
ratio between the data generating distribution and the marginal distribution.
This problem can be solved by logistic regression, and including regularising
penalty terms enables automatic selection of the summary statistics relevant to
the inference task. We illustrate the general theory on canonical examples and
employ it to perform inference for challenging stochastic nonlinear dynamical
systems and high-dimensional summary statistics.

compared to a nearest-neighbor $p$-wave superconducting chain. We study the
Majorana survival probability (MSP) of a particular Majorana edge state when
the initial Hamiltonian ($H_i$) is changed to the quantum critical as well as
off-critical final Hamiltonian ($H_f$) which additionally contains an impurity
term ($H_{imp}$) that breaks the time-reversal invariance. For the off-critical
quenching inside the new topological phase with $H_f= H_i +H_{imp}$, and small
impurity strength ($\lambda_d$), we observe a perfect oscillation of the MSP as
a function of time with a single frequency (determined by the impurity strength
$\lambda_d$) that can be analyzed from an equivalent two-level problem. On the
other hand, the MSP shows a beating like structure with time for quenching to
the phase boundary separating the topological phase (with two edge Majoranas at
each edge) and the non-topological phase where the additional frequency is
given by inverse of the system size. We attribute this behavior of the MSP to
the modification of the energy levels of the final Hamiltonian due to the
application of the impurity term.

second order critical point associated with bistability. The optical cavity is
illuminated by an inhomogeneous spatial gaussian pumping beam, and subjected to
time-delayed feedback. The gaussian injection beam breaks the translational
symmetry of the system by exerting an attracting force on the localized
structure. We show that the localized structure can be pinned to the center of
the inhomogeneity, suppressing the delay-induced drift bifurcation that has
been reported in the particular case where the injection is homogeneous,
assumming a continous wave operation. Under an inhomogeneous spatial pumping
beam, we perform the stability analysis of localized solutions to identify
different instability regimes induced by time-delayed feedback. In particular,
we predict the formation of two-arm spirals, as well as oscillating and
depinning dynamics caused by the interplay of an attracting inhomogeneity and
destabilizing time-delayed feedback. The transition from oscillating to
depinning solutions is investigated by means of numerical continuation
techniques. Analytically, we use two approaches based on either an order
parameter equation, describing the dynamics of the localized structure in the
vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation or an overdamped dynamics of a particle in a
potential well generated by the inhomogeneity. In the later approach, the
time-delayed feedback acts as a driving force.

ultra-sensitive magnetic field sensor. A spin superposition state will acquire
a phase induced by the target field, and we can estimate the field strength
from this phase. Recent studies have aimed at improving sensitivity through the
use of quantum error correction (QEC) to detect and correct any bit-flip errors
that may occur during the sensing period. Here, we investigate the performance
of a two-qubit sensor employing QEC and under the effect of energy relaxation.
Surprisingly, we find that the standard QEC technique to detect and recover
from an error does not improve the sensitivity compared with the single-qubit
sensors. This is a consequence of the fact that the energy relaxation induces
both a phase-flip and a bit-flip noise where the former noise cannot be
distinguished from the relative phase induced from the target fields. However,
we have found that we can improve the sensitivity if we adopt postselection to
discard the state when error is detected. Even when quantum error detection is
moderately noisy, and allowing for the cost of the postselection technique, we
find that this two-qubit system shows an advantage in sensing over a single
qubit in the same conditions.

5$\sigma$ detection of the sum of the neutrino masses when combined with a
CMB-S4 lensing measurement, and with lower-redshift constraints on the growth
of structure and the distance-redshift relation. Parameters characterizing the
epoch of reionization will also be tightly constrained; PIXIE's $\tau$
constraint converts into $\sigma(\rm{z_{re}})=0.2$ for the mean time of
reionization, and a kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurement from S4 gives
$\sigma(\Delta \rm{z_{re}})=0.03$ for the duration of reionization. Both PIXIE
and S4 will put strong constraints on primordial tensor fluctuations, vital for
testing early-universe models, and will do so at distinct angular scales. We
forecast $\sigma(r)\approx 5\times10^{-4}$ for a signal with a tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r=10^{-3}$, after accounting for diffuse foreground removal and
de-lensing. The wide and dense frequency coverage of PIXIE results in an
expected foreground-degradation factor on $r$ of only $\approx$25%. By
measuring large and small scales PIXIE and S4 will together better limit the
energy injection at recombination from dark matter annihilation, with $p_{\rm

arXiv:1205.2953 which, for a gaussian scalar field, expresses the entropy of a
spacetime region in terms of the field's correlation function within that
region (its ""Wightman function"" $W(x,x')$). Carrying this formula over to the
causal set, one obtains an entropy which is both finite and of a Lorentz
invariant nature. We evaluate this global entropy-expression numerically for
certain regions (primarily order-intervals or ""causal diamonds"") within causal
sets of 1+1 dimensions. For the causal-set counterpart of the entanglement
entropy, we obtain, in the first instance, a result that follows a (spacetime)
volume law instead of the expected (spatial) area law. We find, however, that
one obtains an area law if one truncates the commutator function (""Pauli-Jordan
operator"") and the Wightman function by projecting out the eigenmodes of the
Pauli-Jordan operator whose eigenvalues are too close to zero according to a
geometrical criterion which we describe more fully below. In connection with
these results and the questions they raise, we also study the ""entropy of
coarse-graining"" generated by thinning out the causal set, and we compare it
with what one obtains by similarly thinning out a chain of harmonic
oscillators, finding the same, ""universal"" behaviour in both cases.

that the algebra of observables factorizes as a suitable tensor product of

observed deviations from conventional expected value preferences, we formulate
two stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with distorted probabilities on the

bandit. In both settings, we propose algorithms that are inspired by Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB), incorporate cost distortions, and exhibit sublinear
regret assuming \holder continuous weight distortion functions. For the
$K$-armed setting, we show that the algorithm, called W-UCB, achieves
problem-dependent regret $O(L^2 M^2 \log n/ \Delta^{\frac{2}{\alpha}-1})$,
where $n$ is the number of plays, $\Delta$ is the gap in distorted expected
value between the best and next best arm, $L$ and $\alpha$ are the H\""{o}lder
constants for the distortion function, and $M$ is an upper bound on costs, and
a problem-independent regret bound of
$O((KL^2M^2)^{\alpha/2}n^{(2-\alpha)/2})$. We also present a matching lower
bound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially
unimprovable over the class of H\""{o}lder-continuous weight distortions. For
the linearly parameterized setting, we develop a new algorithm, a variant of
the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) algorithm called
WOFUL (Weight-distorted OFUL), and show that it has regret $O(d\sqrt{n} \;
\mbox{polylog}(n))$ with high probability, for sub-Gaussian cost distributions.
Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the advantages resulting from using
distortion-aware learning algorithms.

Mechanisms that affect local concentrations and velocities are of primary
significance to many encounter-based processes in the plankton including
prey-predator interactions, fertilization and aggregate formation. We report
results from simulations of sinking phytoplankton, considered as elongated
spheroids, in homogenous isotropic turbulence to answer the question of whether
trajectories and velocities of sinking phytoplankton are altered by turbulence.
We show in particular that settling spheroids with physical characteristics
similar to those of diatoms weakly cluster and preferentially sample regions of
down-welling flow, corresponding to an increase of the mean settling speed with
respect to the mean settling speed in quiescent fluid. We explain how different
parameters can affect the settling speed and what underlying mechanisms might
be involved. Interestingly, we observe that the increase in the aspect ratio of
the prolate spheroids can affect the clustering and the average settling speed
of particles by two mechanisms: first is the effect of aspect ratio on the
rotation rate of the particles, which saturates faster than the second
mechanism of increasing drag anisotropy.

induced instabilities including polarization attraction and escape phenomena
harnessing of which is a key to unlocking the fiber optic systems
specifications required in high resolution spectroscopy, metrology, biomedicine

of interplay of the Raman scattering-based nonlinearity, the random
birefringence of a fiber, and the pump-to-signal intensity noise transfer has
been done in terms of the fiber Raman amplifier parameters, namely polarization
mode dispersion, the relative intensity noise of the pump laser, fiber length,
and the signal power. The obtained results reveal conditions for emergence of
the random birefringence-induced resonance-like enhancement of the gain

direct long-time forward simulation. A difficulty with long-time simulations of
traveling waves is that the solution leaves any bounded computational domain in
finite time. To handle this problem one should go into a suitable co-moving
frame. Since the velocity of the wave is typically unknown, we use the method
of freezing [Beyn, Th\""ummler 2004], see also [Beyn, Otten, Rottmann-Matthes
2014], which transforms the original partial differential equation (PDE) into a
partial differential algebraic equation (PDAE) and calculates a suitable
co-moving frame on the fly. The efficient numerical approximation of this
freezing PDAE is a challenging problem and we introduce a new numerical
discretization, suitable for problems that consist of hyperbolic conservation
laws which are (nonlinearly) coupled to parabolic equations. The idea of our
scheme is to use the operator splitting approach. The benefit of splitting
methods in this context lies in the possibility to solve hyperbolic and
parabolic parts with different numerical algorithms.
  We test our method at the (viscous) Burgers' equation. Numerical experiments
show linear and quadratic convergence rates for the approximation of the
numerical steady state obtained by a long-time simulation for Lie- and
Strang-splitting, respectively. Due to these affirmative results we expect our
scheme to be suitable also for freezing waves in hyperbolic-parabolic coupled
PDEs.

between local and global properties of graphs. One of the most celebrated
results of this type is the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi triangle removal lemma, which
states that if a graph is $\varepsilon$-far from being triangle free, then most
subsets of vertices of size $C(\varepsilon)$ are not triangle free.
Unfortunately, the best known upper bound on $C(\varepsilon)$ is given by a
tower-type function, and it is known that $C(\varepsilon)$ is not polynomial in
$\varepsilon^{-1}$. The triangle removal lemma has been extended to many other
graph properties, and for some of them the corresponding function
$C(\varepsilon)$ is polynomial. This raised the natural question, posed by
Goldreich in 2005 and more recently by Alon and Fox, of characterizing the
properties for which one can prove removal lemmas with polynomial bounds.
  Our main results in this paper are new sufficient and necessary criteria for
guaranteeing that a graph property admits a removal lemma with a polynomial
bound. Although both are simple combinatorial criteria, they imply almost all
prior positive and negative results of this type. Moreover, our new sufficient
conditions allow us to obtain polynomially bounded removal lemmas for many
properties for which the previously known bounds were of tower-type. In
particular, we show that every {\em semi-algebraic} graph property admits a
polynomially bounded removal lemma. This confirms a conjecture of Alon.

albopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several

investigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public
health in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be

advantages due to misapplied vector control measures and on the other hand of
the high epigenetically adaptation potential, it is in summary recommended to
focus further research on the development of vaccinations for viruses and other
pathogens. By doing so, citizens will be protected without putting ecosystems

that the set of such $t \in [0, T]$ has measure at least $c(\varepsilon) T$ for

detected with a $3.5\sigma$ significance level in each of the bands tested, and
is compatible with the magnification predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. After
an extensive analysis, it cannot be attributed to any known systematic effect.
The detection of the magnification signal is robust to estimated uncertainties
in the outlier rate of the pho- tometric redshifts, but this will be an

the vacuum structure, characterize the masses and couplings of the scalar

is appropriate. We distinguish this from soft and target fragmentation regimes.
Our criteria are based on the kinematic regions used in derivations of
factorization theorems. We argue that, when hard scales are of order a few

constructor terms in the right-hand sides of rules are subterms of the
left-hand sides; the computational intuition is that rules cannot build new
data structures. In programming language research, cons-free languages have
been used to characterize hierarchies of computational complexity classes; in
term rewriting, cons-free first-order TRSs have been used to characterize the
class PTIME.
  We investigate cons-free higher-order term rewriting systems, the complexity
classes they characterize, and how these depend on the type order of the
systems. We prove that, for every K $\geq$ 1, left-linear cons-free systems
with type order K characterize E$^K$TIME if unrestricted evaluation is used
(i.e., the system does not have a fixed reduction strategy).
  The main difference with prior work in implicit complexity is that (i) our
results hold for non-orthogonal term rewriting systems with no assumptions on
reduction strategy, (ii) we consequently obtain much larger classes for each
type order (E$^K$TIME versus EXP$^{K-1}$TIME), and (iii) results for cons-free
term rewriting systems have previously only been obtained for K = 1, and with
additional syntactic restrictions besides cons-freeness and left-linearity.
  Our results are among the first implicit characterizations of the hierarchy E
= E$^1$TIME $\subsetneq$ E$^2$TIME $\subsetneq$ ... Our work confirms prior
results that having full non-determinism (via overlapping rules) does not
directly allow for characterization of non-deterministic complexity classes
like NE. We also show that non-determinism makes the classes characterized
highly sensitive to minor syntactic changes like admitting product types or
non-left-linear rules.

critical step in a variety of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy.
Image registration is commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric
as a cost function. However, this task is challenging due to the non-convex
nature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space
and insufficient approaches for a robust optimization. As a result, current
approaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image
quality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different
approach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We
first cast the image registration problem as a ""strategy learning"" process,
where the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down,
etc.) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is
learned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image
data as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To cope with the
dimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an
end-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The
resulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching
metric and an optimal registration strategy (policy). We demonstrate, on two
3-D/3-D medical image registration examples with drastically different nature
of challenges, that the artificial agent outperforms several state-of-art
registration methods by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and
robustness.

the problem of orientation estimation of a robotic platform. This is
conventionally addressed by extended Kalman filtering of measurements from a
sensor suit which mainly includes accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a digital
compass. Low cost robotic platforms demand simpler and computationally more
efficient methods to address this filtering problem. Hence nonlinear observers
with constant gains have emerged to assume this role. The nonlinear
complementary filter is a popular choice in this domain which does not require
covariance matrix propagation and associated computational overhead in its
filtering algorithm. However, the gain tuning procedure of the complementary
filter is not optimal, where it is often hand picked by trial and error. This
process is counter intuitive to system noise based tuning capability offered by
a stochastic filter like the Kalman filter. This paper proposes the right
invariant formulation of the complementary filter, which preserves Kalman like
system noise based gain tuning capability for the filter. The resulting filter
exhibits efficient operation in elementary embedded hardware, intuitive system
noise based gain tuning capability and accurate attitude estimation. The
performance of the filter is validated using numerical simulations and by
experimentally implementing the filter on an ARDrone 2.0 micro aerial vehicle

Here the results of that paper are used to show that, under the null hypothesis

  Regression","42 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor
regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges
associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the
underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations
could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On
the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In
this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees
for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank
structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied
to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\Theta$ in terms of its
\emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for
non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on
regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and
non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the
non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has
desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound
perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of
examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which
address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and
convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which
show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor
regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms
of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected
descent algorithm are suitably chosen.

experimentation. Over the last decades, alternative methods have been proposed
that can infer causal relations between variables from certain statistical
patterns in purely observational data. We introduce Joint Causal Inference
(JCI), a novel approach to causal discovery from multiple data sets from
different contexts that elegantly unifies both approaches. JCI is a causal
modeling framework rather than a specific algorithm, and it can be implemented
using any causal discovery algorithm that can take into account certain
background knowledge. JCI can deal with different types of interventions (e.g.,
perfect, imperfect, stochastic, etc.) in a unified fashion, and does not
require knowledge of intervention targets or types in case of interventional
data. We explain how several well-known causal discovery algorithms can be seen
as addressing special cases of the JCI framework, and we also propose novel
implementations that extend existing causal discovery methods for purely
observational data to the JCI setting. We evaluate different JCI
implementations on synthetic data and on flow cytometry protein expression data
and conclude that JCI implementations can considerably outperform
state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms.

capturing spatial and spatio-temporal dependence for point patterns. Model
fitting requires approximation of stochastic integrals which is implemented
through discretization of the domain of interest. With fine scale
discretization, inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally
heavy because of the cost of repeated iteration or inversion or Cholesky
decomposition (cubic order) of high dimensional covariance matrices associated
with latent Gaussian variables. Furthermore, hyperparameters for latent
Gaussian variables have strong dependence with sampled latent Gaussian

inefficient and not well behaved.

most important result is that the accretion process is heterogeneous in
multiple ways; in time, in space, and among protostars of otherwise similar
mass. Accretion is heterogeneous in time, in the sense that accretion rates
vary during the evolution, with generally decreasing profiles, whose slopes
vary over a wide range, and where accretion can increase again if a protostar
enters a region with increased density and low speed. Accretion is
heterogeneous in space, because of the mass distribution, with mass approaching
the accreting star-disk system in filaments and sheets. Finally, accretion is
heterogeneous among stars, since the detailed conditions and dynamics in the
neighborhood of each star can vary widely. We also investigate the sensitivity
of disk formation to physical conditions, and test their robustness by varying
numerical parameters. We find that disk formation is robust even when choosing
the least favorable sink particle parameters, and that turbulence cascading
from larger scales is a decisive factor in disk formation. We also investigate
the transport of angular momentum, finding that the net inward mechanical
transport is compensated for mainly by an outward directed magnetic transport,

star formation. Further study of M83's dwarf population will reveal if star
formation in its satellites is commonplace (suggesting a lack of a hot gas
envelope for M83 that would quench star formation) or rare (suggesting that
dw1335-29 has a larger M83-centric distance, and is fortuitously projected to
small radii).

goal in machine learning. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2016) showed one interesting
way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient ascent in the latent

neurons in a separate classifier network. In this paper we extend this method
by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample
quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model
that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227x227) than previous
generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition,
we provide a unified probabilistic interpretation of related activation
maximization methods and call the general class of models ""Plug and Play
Generative Networks"". PPGNs are composed of 1) a generator network G that is
capable of drawing a wide range of image types and 2) a replaceable ""condition""
network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate the generation
of images conditioned on a class (when C is an ImageNet or MIT Places
classification network) and also conditioned on a caption (when C is an image
captioning network). Our method also improves the state of the art of
Multifaceted Feature Visualization, which generates the set of synthetic inputs
that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks
operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task
of image inpainting. While image models are used in this paper, the approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied to many types of data.

stars as initial conditions. Such initial models, however, are difficult to
construct for giant stars because of the wide range in spatial scales of the
hydrostatic equilibrium and in dynamical timescales between the core and the
envelope of the giant. They are needed for, e.g., modeling the common envelope
phase where a giant envelope encompasses both the giant core and a companion
star. Here, we present a new method of approximating and reconstructing giant
profiles from a stellar evolution code to produce stable models for
multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We determine typical stellar
stratification profiles with the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. After an
appropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the
moving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the
core of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation
of the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that
can specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping
to a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities
yields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially
convectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while
for stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution
code, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and
show large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8. Examples are shown
for a $2M_\odot$ red giant and a $0.67M_\odot$ asymptotic giant branch star. A
detailed analysis shows that the improved method reliably provides stable
models of giant envelopes that can be used as initial conditions for subsequent
hydrodynamical simulations of stellar interactions involving giant stars.

is clearly detected in the ALMA data and resolved on scales of ~2 kpc, in both
continuum (\lambda_rest ~150 um) and [C II]157.74 um line emission. The
continuum emission is in good agreement with the expectations from the Herschel

detect companion sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) for three sources -- one
FIR-bright and two FIR-faint, separated by ~14-45 kpc and <450 km/s from the
quasar hosts. The [C II]-based dynamical mass estimates for the interacting
SMGs are within a factor of ~3 of the quasar hosts' masses, while the continuum
emission implies SFR(quasar)~(2-11)xSFR(SMG). Our ALMA data therefore clearly
support the idea that major mergers are important drivers for rapid early SMBH
growth. However, the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by
interacting SMGs and the gas kinematics as observed by ALMA suggest that other
processes may be fueling these systems. Our analysis thus demonstrates the
diversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated
with early and rapid SMBH growth.

hard to use the jetted TDE population to explain the flux and the isotropic

the dominant sources, unless those without aligned jets can produce wide-angle
emission of neutrino particles. Supposing that is the case, we list a few
recent jetted and non-jetted TDEs that have the best chance to be detected by
IceCube, based on their energetics, distances, and directions. A spatial and

population. Previous work focused on measuring the slope of the IMF over one or
more stellar mass intervals, implicitly assuming that this is a good
description of the IMF and that the IMF has a universal low-mass cutoff. In
this work we consider more flexible IMFs, including two-component power-laws
with a variable low-mass cutoff and a general non-parametric model. We
demonstrate with mock spectra that the detailed shape of the IMF can be
accurately recovered as long as the data quality are high (S/N$\gtrsim300$) and
cover a wide wavelength range (0.4um-1.0um). We apply these flexible IMF models
to a high S/N spectrum of the center of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1407.
Fitting the spectrum with non-parametric IMFs, we find that the IMF in the
center shows a continuous rise extending toward the hydrogen-burning limit,
with a behavior that is well-approximated by a power-law with an index of -2.7.
These results provide strong evidence for the existence of extreme

densities and velocity divergences measured in two concentric spheres, we
extract with the same accuracy velocity profiles and conditional velocity PDF
subject to a given over/under-density which are of interest to understand the
non-linear evolution of velocity flows. Both PDFs are used to build a simple
but accurate maximum likelihood estimators for the redshift evolution of the
variance of both the density and velocity divergence fields, which have smaller
relative errors than their sample variances when non-linearities appear. Given
the dependence of the velocity divergence on the growth rate, there is a
significant gain in using the full knowledge of both PDFs to derive constraints
on the equation of state of dark energy. Thanks to the insensitivity of the
velocity divergence to bias, its PDF can be used to obtain unbiased constraints
on the growth of structures ($\sigma_8$,f) or it can be combined with the
galaxy density PDF to extract bias parameters.

finding tensor modes with sufficiently large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Here
we will try to answer two related questions: Is it possible to rule out all
large field inflationary models by not finding tensor modes with $r$ above some
critical value, and what can we say about the scale of inflation by measuring
$r$? However, in order to answer these questions one should distinguish between
two different definitions of the large field inflation and three different

this paper, we assume that only a few central CORE frequency channels are

astrophysical contaminants. On the theoretical side, we assume LCDM as our
general framework and quantify the improvement provided by CORE over the
current constraints from the Planck 2015 release. We also study the joint
sensitivity of CORE and of future Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Large Scale

of inflation are presented in another paper of the series. In addition to the
six parameters of the base LCDM, which describe the matter content of a
spatially flat universe with adiabatic and scalar primordial fluctuations from
inflation, we derive the precision achievable on parameters like those
describing curvature, neutrino physics, extra light relics, primordial helium

rapidly star-forming environment. We apply the variable Eddington tensor
algorithm to re-examine the two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic problem of a
column of gas that is accelerated by a constant infrared radiation flux. In the
absence of gravity, the system is primarily characterized by the initial
optical depth of the gas. We perform several runs with different initial
optical depth and resolution. We find that the gas spreads out along the
vertical direction, as its mean velocity and velocity dispersion increase. In
contrast to previous work using flux-limited diffusion algorithm, we find
little evolution in the trapping factor. The momentum coupling between
radiation and gas in the absence of gravity is similar to that with gravity.
For Eddington ratio increasing with the height in the system, the momentum
transfer from the radiation to the gas is not merely $\sim L/c$, but amplified
by a factor of $1+\eta \tau_{\rm IR}$, where $\tau_{\rm IR}$ is the integrated
infrared optical depth through the system, and $\eta\sim0.5-0.9$, decreasing
with the optical depth. We apply our results to the atmosphere of galaxies and
conclude that radiation pressure may be an important mechanism for driving
winds in the most rapidly star-forming galaxies and starbursts.

All cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through

voltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing
to the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two

are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation

Since Q during acceleration or transport may depend upon the source plasma
temperature T, the pattern of element enhancements can provide a best-fit
measure of T. The small SEP events we call 3He-rich or ""impulsive"" show average
enhancements, relative to coronal abundances, rising as the 3.6 power of A/Q to
a factor of ~1000 for (76<=Z<=82)/O and temperature in the range 2-4 MK. This
acceleration is believed to occur in islands of magnetic reconnection on open
field lines in solar flares and jets. It has been recently found that the large
shock-accelerated ""gradual"" SEP events have a broad range of source plasma
temperatures; 69% have coronal temperatures of T < 1.6 MK, while 24% have T ~ 3
MK, the latter suggesting a seed population containing residual impulsive
suprathermal ions. Most of the large event-to-event abundance variations and
their time variation are largely explained by variations in T magnified by
A/Q-dependent fractionation during transport. However, the non-thermal variance
of impulsive SEP events (~30%) exceeds that of the ~3 MK gradual events (~10%)
so that several small impulsive events must be averaged together with the
ambient plasma to form the seed population for shock acceleration in these

super-horizon perturbations produced by inflation must contain some minimum

slow-roll models, where this lower bound is saturated, non-Gaussianity is
controlled by two observables: the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is uncertain
by more than fifty orders of magnitude; and the scalar spectral index, or tilt,

However there is no
universally accepted, formal, and yet broadly applicable definition of what an
organism is. Here we introduce a candidate definition. We adopt the view that
the ""organism"" is a functional concept, used by scientists to address
particular questions concerning the future state of a biological system, rather
than something wholly defined by that system. In this approach organisms are a
coarse-graining of a fine-grained dynamical model of a biological system.
Crucially, the coarse-graining of the system into organisms is chosen so that
their dynamics can be used by scientists to make accurate predictions of those
features of the biological system that interests them, and do so with minimal
computational burden. To illustrate our framework we apply it to a dynamic
model of lichen symbiosis---a system where either the lichen or its constituent
fungi and algae could reasonably be considered ""organisms."" We find that the
best choice for what organisms are in this scenario are complex mixtures of
many entities that do not resemble standard notions of organisms. When we
restrict our allowed coarse-grainings to more traditional types of organisms,
we find that ecological conditions, such as niche competition and predation
pressure, play a significant role in determining the best choice for organisms.

Even
when minimally coupled to gravity, these fields might evade the assumptions of
the black-hole no-hair theorems and give rise to spinning black holes which can
be drastically different from the Kerr metric. Furthermore, they allow for
self-gravitating compact solitons, known as (scalar or Proca) boson stars. The
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray flux emitted by
accreting compact objects carry information about the strong-field region, thus
providing a powerful tool to constrain deviations from Kerr's geometry and to
search for exotic compact objects. By using the relativistic precession model
as a proxy to interpret the QPOs in terms of geodesic frequencies, we
investigate how the QPO frequencies could be used to test the no-hair theorem
and the existence of light bosonic fields near accreting compact objects. We
show that a detection of two QPO triplets with current sensitivity can already
constrain these models, and that the future eXTP mission or a LOFT-like mission
can set very stringent constraints on black holes with bosonic hair and on
(scalar or Proca) boson stars. The peculiar geodesic structure of compact

photons strike the detector within the processing time of the detector photon
pile-up occurs and the signal received by the detector during this interval

being incident upon the detector is uniform over time, and thus pile-up follows
Poisson statistics. In this paper we present a mathematical treatment of the
relationship between photon timing statistics and the count rate of an XRF

compactifications with ""bulk"" standard model (SM) was proposed: in addition to
the UV (Planck scale) and IR (a couple of TeV) branes, there is an intermediate
brane, taken to be around 10 TeV. The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from
the UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity
fields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest
gauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying
flavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the
lightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect
permits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include
flavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -
decay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of
SM gauge bosons. In this work, we first delineate the parameter space where the
above mentioned cascade decay of gauge KK particles dominates, and thereby can
be the discovery mode at the LHC. We then perform a detailed analysis of the
LHC signals from this model, finding that 300/fb suffices for evidence of
KK-gluon in tri-jet, jet + di-photon and jet + di-boson channels. However, KK
photon in photon + di-jet, and KK-W in leptonic W + di-jet require 3000/fb. The
crucial feature of this decay chain is a ""double"" resonance, i.e. 3-particle
and 2-particle invariant mass peaks, corresponding to the KK gauge boson and
the radion respectively.

interaction, and is distinct from the orbital effect, such as van Vleck
susceptibility. It is shown that while the quadratic term in the magnetization
favors to point the spins along the bond, the fourth order term in
magnetization prefers to point spins to the perpendicular direction. The theory
is applied to the Heisenberg-Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice and a cubic
lattice model that is potentially relevant to perovskite iridates. We show
that, in these models, the anisotropic terms in quadratic order cancels out,

This mechanism may play a part in sustaining turbulence in various

amplification depends on the net effect of the compressive forcing and
turbulent dissipation. By giving an argument for a bound on this dissipation,
we give a lower bound for the scaling of the turbulent velocity with
compression ratio in compressed turbulence. That is, turbulence undergoing
compression will be enhanced at least as much as the bound given here, subject
to a set of caveats that will be outlined. Used as a validation check, this

debatable question. Empirical Bayes methods offer a data-driven solution to
this problem by estimating the prior itself from an ensemble of data. In the
nonparametric case, the maximum likelihood estimate is known to overfit the

majority of regularizations are ad hoc choices which lack invariance under
reparametrization of the model and result in inconsistent estimates for
equivalent models. We introduce a non-parametric, transformation invariant

the bottom-heavy IMF that has been reported as typical for high-$\sigma$ ETGs
based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis techniques. We
use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from

stellar dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses using
an updated version of the stellar population synthesis models developed by
Conroy & van Dokkum. When examined individually, we find good agreement among
these methods for one galaxy. The other two galaxies show 2-3$\sigma$ tension
with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when
considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 Msol. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff
or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates
to $<2\sigma$. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass
stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of
matched-$\sigma$ ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the

measurements. These effects are often predicted to be stronger at
high-redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$) that are inaccessible to massive galaxy surveys on
foreseeable instrumentation, but IGM tomography of the Ly$\alpha$ forest from
closely-spaced quasars and galaxies is starting to measure the $z\sim2-3$

coeval galaxy samples, to measure alignment between galaxies and the cosmic web

$\Delta\langle\cos\theta\rangle$, with respect to the tidal tensor eigenvectors
from the underlying density field, and also consider observational effects such
as errors in the galaxy position angle, inclination, and redshift. Measurements
using the upcoming $\sim1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ CLAMATO tomographic survey and 600
coeval zCOSMOS-Deep galaxies should place $3\sigma$ limits on extreme alignment

To find their periods I calculated the autocorrelation function of the Kepler
mission photometry for each star. In most systems for which good periods can be
found, the cooler star has a longer period than the hotter component in general
agreement with models. However, there is a wide range in the gradients of lines
connecting binary pairs in a period-color diagram. Furthermore, near the solar
color, only a few stars have longer periods than the Sun, suggesting that they,
and their cooler companions are not much older than the Sun. In addition, there
is an apparent gap at intermediate periods in the period distribution of the
late K and early M stars. Either star formation in this direction has been
variable, or stars evolve in period at a non-uniform rate, or some stars evolve
more rapidly than others at the same mass. Finally, using the autocorrelation
function as a measure of the activity level, I found that while the F, G and
early K stars become less active as their periods increase, there is no
correlation between period and activity for the mid K to early M stars.

tractable proba- bility density functions. This largely limits the design and
implementation of vari- ational inference methods. We consider wild variational
inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the

of subsystems in a pure state. We investigate entanglement entropy (EE) growth
in global quenches in holographic field theories and relate some of its aspects
to quantities characterizing chaos. More specifically we obtain four key
results:
  1. We prove holographic bounds on the entanglement velocity $v_E$ and the
butterfly effect speed $v_B$ that arises in the study of chaos.
  2. We obtain the EE as a function of time for large spherical entangling
surfaces analytically. We show that the EE is insensitive to the details of the
initial state or quench protocol.
  3. In a thermofield double state we determine analytically the two-sided
mutual information between two large concentric spheres separated in time.
  4. We derive a bound on the rate of growth of EE for arbitrary shapes, and
develop an expansion for EE at early times.
  In a companion paper arXiv:1608.05101, we put these results in the broader
context of EE growth in chaotic systems: we relate EE growth to the chaotic
spreading of operators, derive bounds on EE at a given time, and compare the
holographic results to spin chain numerics and toy models. In this paper, we
perform holographic calculations that provide the basis of arguments presented

  Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, various deep-neural-network (DNN)-based approaches have been
proposed for single-image super-resolution (SISR). Despite their promising
results on major structure regions such as edges and lines, they still suffer
from limited performance on texture regions that consist of very complex and
fine patterns. This is because, during the acquisition of a low-resolution (LR)
image via down-sampling, these regions lose most of the high frequency
information necessary to represent the texture details. In this paper, we
present a novel texture enhancement framework for SISR to effectively improve
the spatial resolution in the texture regions as well as edges and lines. We
call our method, high-resolution (HR) style transfer algorithm. Our framework
consists of three steps: (i) generate an initial HR image from an interpolated
LR image via an SISR algorithm, (ii) generate an HR style image from the
initial HR image via down-scaling and tiling, and (iii) combine the HR style
image with the initial HR image via a customized style transfer algorithm.
Here, the HR style image is obtained by down-scaling the initial HR image and
then repetitively tiling it into an image of the same size as the HR image.
This down-scaling and tiling process comes from the idea that texture regions
are often composed of small regions that similar in appearance albeit sometimes
different in scale. This process creates an HR style image that is rich in
details, which can be used to restore high-frequency texture details back into
the initial HR image via the style transfer algorithm. Experimental results on
a number of texture datasets show that our proposed HR style transfer algorithm
provides more visually pleasing results compared with competitive methods.

useful in settings where providing an ML or a CL constraint is difficult

  Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for learning a kernel matrix
using the log determinant divergence --- a variant of the Bregman divergence
--- subject to a set of relative-distance constraints. The learned kernel
matrix can then be employed by many different kernel methods in a wide range of
applications. In our experimental evaluations, we consider a semi-supervised

yield clusterings of higher quality than existing approaches that either use
ML/CL constraints or a different means to implement the supervision using

energy produced per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass, which has
important consequences for life organization. This phenomenon, when considered
across different taxa, is called interspecific allometric scaling. Here, on the
basis of introduced biomechanical models, physiological and evolutionary
principles, we discover and validate its fundamental mechanisms. Calculated
theoretical values of allometric exponents for the maximal and basal metabolic
rates, for mammals, reptiles, fish and birds, correspond to experimental data.
This proves that the cooperative action of discovered mechanisms, indeed, is
the cause of this phenomenon, and that allometric scaling is rather a
statistical effect of individual evolutionary and physiological adaptations of
organisms within the food chain, both in terms of metabolism and biomechanical
constraints. The increase in size is coupled with the increase of the overall
metabolic rate due to the change of biomechanical characteristics and the need
to meet certain functional requirements for a successful reproduction (like the
speed advantage over the prey). On one hand, organisms have to reliably acquire
sufficient food for that. On the other hand, neither biomechanical nor
metabolic advantage can be too strong - otherwise, the food chain could be
destroyed. The counteraction of these two needs establishes a dynamic balance
in the food chain, which, together with biomechanical constraints, explains the
phenomenon of allometric scaling. Once acknowledged, this discovery will have
numerous important implications in ecological, evolutionary, physiological and
other studies, as well as in practical applications.

show that it is trivial when the residual representation has full image. When
the residual representation is a symmetric cube, the zero locus defined by the

(EVs) in a charging station. The EVs can inject energies by discharging via a
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service which can enhance the profits of the charging
station. However, frequent charging and discharging degrade battery life. A
proper compensation needs to be paid to the users to participate in the V2G
service. We propose a menu-based pricing scheme, where the charging station
selects a price for each arriving user for the amount of battery utilization,
the total energy, and the time (deadline) that the EV will stay. The user can
accept one of the contracts or rejects all depending on their utilities. The
charging station can serve users using a combination of the renewable energy
and the conventional energy bought from the grid. We show that though there
exists a profit maximizing price which maximizes the social welfare, it
provides no surplus to the users if the charging station is aware of the
utilities of the users. If the charging station is not aware of the exact
utilities, the social welfare maximizing price may not maximize the expected
profit. In fact, it can give a zero profit. We propose a pricing strategy which
provides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and it also
maximizes the expected profit for a wide range of utility functions. Our
analysis shows that when the harvested renewable energy is small the users have
higher incentives for the V2G service. We, numerically, show that the charging
station's profit and the user's surplus both increase as V2G service is
efficiently utilized by the pricing mechanism.

procurement up to the detection of sources, is generally automated. One of the
main challenges is contamination by artifacts, especially in regions of strong
unresolved emission. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for
variables and transients from the outputs of such surveys' data pipelines. We
use the method to systematically search for novae in iPTF observations of the
bulge of M31. We demonstrate that most artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline
form a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying
Poissonian statistics, whereas genuine variables and transients as well as
artifacts associated with bright stars result in clusters of detections, whose
spread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the
problem analogous to source detection on images produced by X-ray telescopes,
enabling one to utilize tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we
use a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis
package CIAO. Starting from ~2.5x10^5 raw detections made by the iPTF data
pipeline, we obtain ~4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these
candidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image, we find
counterparts for ~90% of them. These are either artifacts due to imperfect PSF
matching or genuine variable sources. The remaining ~400 detections are
transient sources. We identify novae among these candidates by applying
selection cuts based on the expected properties of nova lightcurves. Thus, we
recovered all 12 known novae registered during the time span of the survey and
discovered three nova candidates. Our method is generic and can be applied for
mining any target out of the artifacts in optical time-domain data. As it is
fully automated, its incompleteness can be accurately computed and corrected
for.

simulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to study the spatial distribution of
specific angular momenta, $j(r,\theta)$. We show that by stacking haloes with
similar masses to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the profile can be fitted
as a simple function, $j(r,\theta)=j_s \sin^2(\theta/\theta_s)
(r/r_s)^2/(1+r/r_s)^4 $, with three free parameters, $j_s, r_s$, and
$\theta_s$. Specifically, $j_s$ correlates with the halo mass $M_\mathrm{vir}$
as $j_s\propto M_\mathrm{vir}^{2/3}$, $r_s$ has a weak dependence on the halo
mass as $r_s \propto M_\mathrm{vir}^{0.040}$, and $\theta_s$ is independent of
$M_\mathrm{vir}$. This profile agrees with that from a rigid shell model,
though its origin is unclear. Our universal specific angular momentum profile
$j(r,\theta)$ is useful in modelling haloes' angular momenta. Furthermore, by
using an empirical stellar mass - halo mass relation, we can infer the averaged
angular momentum distribution of a dark matter halo. The specific angular
momentum - stellar mass relation within a halo computed from our profile is
shown to share a similar shape as that from the observed disk galaxies.

systems can be triggered and the role played by external perturbations. A
famous example is the origin of randomness in the laminar-turbulence
transition, which is raised in the pipe flow experiment by Reynolds as a
century old unresolved problem. Although there exist different hypotheses, it
is widely believed that the randomness is ""intrinsic"", which, however, remains
as an open question to be verified. Simulating the modeled Rayleigh-Benard
convection system by means of the so-called clean numerical simulation (CNS)
with negligible numerical noises that are smaller even than thermal
fluctuation, we verify that turbulence can be self-excited from the inherent
thermal fluctuation, without any external disturbances, i.e. out of nothing.
This reveals a relationship between microscopic physical uncertainty and
macroscopic randomness. It is found that in physics the system nonlinearity
functions as a channel for randomness information, and energy as well, to
transport microscopic uncertainty toward large scales. Such scenario can
generally be helpful to understand the various relevant phenomena. In
methodology, compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS), CNS opens a new
direction to investigate turbulent flows with largely improved accuracy and
reliability.

An efficient pattern recognition algorithm should be able to provide correct

learning pattern recognition algorithms, Artificial fish swarm algorithm is one
of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithms that works based on
population and stochastic search. In order to achieve acceptable result, there
are many parameters needs to be adjusted in AFSA. Among these parameters,
visual and step are very significant in view of the fact that artificial fish
basically move based on these parameters. In standard AFSA, these two
parameters remain constant until the algorithm termination. Large values of
these parameters increase the capability of algorithm in global search, while
small values improve the local search ability of the algorithm. In this paper,
we empirically study the performance of the AFSA and different approaches to
balance between local and global exploration have been tested based on the
adaptive modification of visual and step during algorithm execution. The
proposed approaches have been evaluated based on the four well-known benchmark
functions. Experimental results show considerable positive impact on the

channels. On the other hand, as only the sparsity is assumed, the proposed
method is robust with respect to the statistical properties of the channel and

the separation of interfering users from adjacent base stations. Additionally,
a performance limit is derived based on the clairvoyant Cram\'er Rao lower

key step towards this challenge is to adapt models learned on domains where
large amounts of annotated training data are available to domains with scarce

  In this paper, we propose methods to effectively adapt models learned on one
domain onto other domains using distributed word representations. First we
analyze the linguistic variation present across domains to identify key
linguistic insights that can boost performance across domains. We propose
methods to capture domain specific semantics of word usage in addition to

the time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays

report results on MNIST and SVHN datasets, and also test regular deterministic
autoencoders, reaching similar conclusions in all cases. Finally, we show that
the usual adversarial attack for classifiers, while being much easier, also

  2. The fixed-terminal edge-weighted bicut is known to have a tight

The goal of this paper is analyzing a specific and relevant RE problem in
detail: incomplete/hidden requirements. We replicated a global family of RE
surveys with representatives of software organizations in Austria and Brazil.
We used the data to (a) characterize the criticality of the selected RE
problem, and to (b) analyze the reported main causes and mitigation actions.
Based on the analysis, we discuss how to prevent the problem. The survey
includes 14 different organizations in Austria and 74 in Brazil, including
small, medium and large sized companies, conducting both, plan-driven and agile
development processes. Respondents from both countries cited the
incomplete/hidden requirements problem as one of the most critical RE problems.
We identified and graphically represented the main causes and documented
solution options to address these causes. Further, we compiled a list of
reported mitigation actions. From a practical point of view, this paper
provides further insights into common causes of incomplete/hidden requirements
and on how to prevent this problem.

Bose-Einstein condensate, which is in the Thomas-Fermi regime at zero
temperature and described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, is considered in
the hydrodynamic ""anelastic"" approximation. In the presence of a smoothly
inhomogeneous array of filaments (vortex lattice), a non-canonical Hamiltonian
equation of motion is derived for the macroscopically averaged vorticity, with
taking into account the spatial non-uniformity of the equilibrium condensate
density determined by the trap potential. A minimum of the corresponding
Hamiltonian describes a static configuration of deformed vortex lattice against
a given density background. The minimum condition is reduced to a vector
nonlinear partial differential equation of the second order, for which some
approximate and exact solutions are found. It is shown that if the condensate
density has an anisotropic Gaussian profile then equation of motion for the
averaged vorticity admits solutions in the form of a spatially uniform vector
with a nontrivial time dependence. An integral representation is obtained for
the matrix Green function determining the non-local Hamiltonian of a system of
arbitrary shaped vortex filaments in a condensate with Gaussian density. ... A
simple approximate expression for the two-dimensional Green function is
suggested at rather arbitrary density profile, and its successful comparison to
the exact result in the Gaussian case is done. Approximate equations of motion
are derived which describe a long-wave dynamics of interacting vortex filaments
in condensates with the density depending on the transverse coordinates only.

demonstrate that the pure conformal invariant gravity models can be constructed

estimates of detection probabilities. The standard model for estimating
detection from removal-sampled point-count surveys assumes that organisms at a
survey site are detected at a constant rate; however, this assumption is often
not justified. We consider a class of N-mixture models that allows for
detection heterogeneity over time through a flexibly defined time-to-detection
distribution (TTDD) and allows for fixed and random effects for both abundance
and detection. Our model is thus a combination of survival time-to-event
analysis with unknown-N, unknown-p abundance estimation. We specifically
explore two-parameter families of TTDDs, e.g. gamma, that can additionally
include a mixture component to model increased probability of detection in the
initial observation period. We find that modeling a TTDD by using a
two-parameter family is necessary when data have a chance of arising from a
distribution of this nature. In addition, models with a mixture component can
outperform non-mixture models even when the truth is non-mixture. Finally, we
analyze an Overbird data set from the Chippewa National Forest using mixed
effect models for both abundance and detection. We demonstrate that the effects
of explanatory variables on abundance and detection are consistent across
mixture TTDDs but that flexible TTDDs result in lower estimated probabilities

the microlensing and multi-frequency emissions as these objects are expected to
be faint and microlensing experiments have already hinted at their possibility.
In the case that these objects are composed of Dark Matter (DM) then there are
both few limits on their abundance but many consequences of their existence or
non-existence on both local and cosmic scales. In this work we examine the
possibility of Ultra-Compact Mini-Halos (UCMHs) formed in the early universe.
These objects can persist to the present epoch due to their large central
density inuring them to the worst effects of later tidal stripping. As such,
these objects could constitute probes of many details of early universe
physics, such as primordial phase-transitions, inflation, small scale
exploration of the primordial density perturbation field and non-Gaussianity of
these density perturbations. The fact that they are also highly dark
matter-dominated objects means that they are attractive objects of study in the
continuing hunt for the nature of Dark Matter (DM) through indirect detection.
Another reason to study such objects in the local environment is found in the
conjecture that encounters with UCMHs could induce catastrophic events on
planets within our solar system, e.g. mass-extinction events on Earth. We will
outline a strategy for multi-frequency UCMH searches within the region of the
Milky-Way in which Gaia can accurately reconstruct microlens masses. This
methodology ensures that any candidate UCMH DM emission should correlate to
some unidentified microlensing object with determinable mass and demonstrate
that large-scale volcanic extinctions on Earth due to UCMHs are unlikely but
that it is possible for loss of the Martian geodynamo to be driven encounters
with such compact objects.

drawn growing attention since the discovery of heat interference in 2012.
Thermal interferometers, diodes, transistors and nano-valves have been
theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated by exploiting the
quantum phase difference between two superconductors coupled through a
Josephson junction. So far, the quantum-phase modulator has been realized in
the form of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) or a
superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor (SQUIPT). Thence, an
external magnetic field is necessary in order to manipulate the heat transport.
Here, we theoretically propose the first on-chip fully thermal caloritronic
device: the phase-tunable temperature amplifier. Taking advantage of a recent
thermoelectric effect discovered in spin-split superconductors coupled to a
spin-polarized system, by a temperature gradient we generate the magnetic flux
controlling the transport through a temperature biased SQUIPT. By employing
commonly used materials and a geometry compatible with state-of-the-art
nano-fabrication techniques, we simulate the behavior of the temperature
amplifier and define a number of figures of merit in full analogy with voltage
amplifiers. Notably, our architecture ensures infinite input thermal impedance,
maximum gain of about 11 and efficiency reaching the 95%. This device concept
could represent a breakthrough in coherent caloritronic devices, and paves the
way for applications in radiation sensing, thermal logics and quantum

generation is to equip the renewable plants with energy storage systems. This
paper focuses on designing profit maximization offering strategies, i.e., the
strategies that determine the offering price and volume, for a storage-assisted
renewable power producer that participates in hour-ahead electricity market.
Designing the strategies is challenging since (i) the underlying problem is
coupled across time due to the evolution of the storage level, and (ii) inputs
to the problem including the renewable output and market clearing price are
unknown when submitting offers. Following the competitive online algorithm
design approach, we first study a basic setting where the renewable output and
the clearing price are known for the next hour. We propose sOffer, a simple
online offering strategy that achieves the best possible competitive ratio of
O(log \theta), where $\theta$ is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum
clearing prices. Then, we consider the case where the clearing price is
unknown. By exploiting the idea of submitting multiple offers to combat price
uncertainty, we propose mOffer, and demonstrate that the competitive ratio of
mOffer converges to that of sOffer as the number of offers grows. Finally, we
extend our approach to the scenario where the renewable output has forecasting
error. We propose gOffer as the generalized offering strategy and characterize
its competitive ratio as a function of the forecasting error. Our trace-driven
experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve performance close to the
offline optimal and outperform a baseline alternative significantly.

describing glassy systems. By construction, their equilibrium state is trivial
and there are no equal-time correlations between the occupancy of different
sites. We drive such models out of equilibrium by connecting them to two
reservoirs of different densities, and measure the response of the system to
this perturbation. We find that under the proper coarse-graining, the behavior
of these models may be expressed by a nonlinear diffusion equation, with a
model- and density-dependent diffusion coefficient. We find a simple
approximation for the diffusion coefficient, and show that the relatively mild
discrepancy between the approximation and our numerical results arises due to
non-negligible correlations that appear as the system is driven out of
equilibrium, even when the density gradient is infinitesimally small. Similar
correlations appear when such kinetically-constrained models are driven out of
equilibrium by applying a uniform external force. We suggest that these
correlations are the reason for the same discrepancy between the approximate
diffusion coefficient and the numerical results for a broader group of models,
non-gradient lattice-gas models, for which kinetically-constrained models are
arguably the simplest example thereof.

Then we present a new parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows
efficient training of an RNN while ensuring that the matrix is always

allocation games: atomic splittable congestion games and multimarket Cournot
oligopolies. For atomic splittable congestion games with singleton strategies
and player-specific affine cost functions, we devise the first polynomial time
algorithm computing a pure Nash equilibrium. Our algorithm is combinatorial and
computes the exact equilibrium assuming rational input. The idea is to compute
an equilibrium for an associated integrally-splittable singleton congestion
game in which the players can only split their demands in integral multiples of
a common packet size. While integral games have been considered in the
literature before, no polynomial time algorithm computing an equilibrium was
known. Also for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and
use it as a building block for our main algorithm.
  We then develop a polynomial time computable transformation mapping a
multimarket Cournot competition game with firm-specific affine price functions
and quadratic costs to an associated atomic splittable congestion game as
described above. The transformation preserves equilibria in either games and,
thus, leads -- via our first algorithm -- to a polynomial time algorithm
computing Cournot equilibria. Finally, our analysis for integrally-splittable
games implies new bounds on the difference between real and integral Cournot
equilibria. The bounds can be seen as a generalization of the recent bounds for

238U(n,g) reaction cross section in the energy region from 1 eV to 700 keV.
This reaction is of fundamental importance for the design calculations of
nuclear reactors, governing the behaviour of the reactor core. In particular,
fast reactors, which are experiencing a growing interest for their ability to
burn radioactive waste, operate in the high energy region of the neutron
spectrum. In this energy region most recent evaluations disagree due to
inconsistencies in the existing measurements of up to 15%. In addition, the
assessment of nuclear data uncertainty performed for innovative reactor systems
shows that the uncertainty in the radiative capture cross-section of 238U
should be further reduced to 1-3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV. To
this purpose, addressed by the Nuclear Energy Agency as a priority nuclear data
need, complementary experiments, one at the GELINA and two at the n_TOF
facility, were proposed and carried out within the 7th Framework Project ANDES
of the European Commission.
  The results of one of these 238U(n,g) measurements performed at the n_TOF
CERN facility are presented in this work. The gamma-ray cascade following the
radiative neutron capture has been detected exploiting a setup of two C6D6
liquid scintillators. Resonance parameters obtained from this work are on
average in excellent agreement with the ones reported in evaluated libraries.
In the unresolved resonance region, this work yields a cross section in
agreement with evaluated libraries up to 80 keV, while for higher energies our
results are significantly higher.

flow problem. Specifically, we present a strategy that takes advantage of
existing black-box fast iterative linear solvers, i.e. algebraic multigrid
methods. We show with standard benchmarks that, while less competitive than
combinatorial techniques on small problems that run on a single core, our
approach scales well with problem size, complexity, and number of processors,
allowing for tackling large-scale problems on modern parallel architectures.
Our approach is based on combining interior-point with multigrid methods for
solving the nonlinear KKT equations via Newton's method. However, the Jacobian
matrix arising in the Newton iteration is indefinite and its condition number
cannot be expected to be bounded. In fact, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian can
both vanish and blow up near the solution, leading to a significant slow-down
of the convergence speed of iterative solvers - or to the loss of convergence
at all. In order to allow for the application of multigrid methods, which have
been originally designed for elliptic problems, we furthermore show that the
occurring Jacobian can be interpreted as the stiffness matrix of a mixed
formulation of the weighted graph Laplacian of the network, whose metric
depends on the slack variables and the multipliers of the inequality
constraints. Together with our regularization, this allows for the application
of a black-box algebraic multigrid method on the Schur-complement of the
system.

Traditionally, they have been studied
through their extraction from hot stars, because of their smooth continuum. In
an era where there are several going-on or planned massive Galactic surveys
using multi-object spectrographs, cool stars constitute an appealing set of
targets. From the technical point of view, the extraction of DIBs in their
spectra is more challenging due to the complexity of the continuum. In this
contribution we will provide the community with an improved set of stellar
lines in the spectral regions associated to the strong DIBs at l6196, l6269,
l6284, and l6379. These lines will allow for the creation of better stellar
synthetic spectra, reproducing the background emission and a more accurate
extraction of the magnitudes associated with a given DIB. The Sun and Arcturus
were used as representative examples of dwarf and giant stars, respectively. A
high quality spectrum for each of them was modeled using TURBOSPECTRUM and the
VALD stellar line list. The oscillator strength log(gf) and/or wavelength of
specific lines were modified to create synthetic spectra where the residuals in
both the Sun and Arcturus were minimized. The synthetic spectra based on the
improved line lists reproduce the observed spectra for the Sun and Arcturus in
the mentioned spectral ranges with greater accuracy. Residuals between the
synthetic and observed spectra are always <10%, much better than with
previously existing options. The new line list has been tested with some
characteristic spectra, from a variety of stars, including both giant and dwarf
stars, and under different degrees of extinction. As it happened with the Sun
and Arcturus residuals in the fits used to extract the DIB information are
smaller when using synthetic spectra made with the updated line lists. Tables
with the updated parameters are provided to the community.

very useful yet very dangerous platform for the victim and the suspect to

be reduced to bitwise operations and popcounts, which can offer much higher
throughput than 32-bit multiplications and additions.

robust crowd count estimator using computer vision techniques has attracted
significant research interest in recent years. Applications for crowd counting
systems exist in many diverse areas including city planning, retail, and of
course general public safety. Developing a highly generalised counting model
that can be deployed in any surveillance scenario with any camera perspective
is the key objective for research in this area. Techniques developed in the
past have generally performed poorly in highly congested scenes with several
thousands of people in frame (Rodriguez et al., 2011). Our approach, influenced
by the work of (Zhang et al., 2016), consists of the following contributions:
(1) A training set augmentation scheme that minimises redundancy among training
samples to improve model generalisation and overall counting performance; (2) a
deep, single column, fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture; (3) a
multi-scale averaging step during inference. The developed technique can
analyse images of any resolution or aspect ratio and achieves state-of-the-art
counting performance on the Shanghaitech Part B and UCF CC 50 datasets as well
as competitive performance on Shanghaitech Part A.

with production decisions that have to be evaluated based on their expectations
about the future utility of the produced entity which in turn depends on the
global production level via a trading mechanism. While the original dynamical
systems formulation assumes an infinite number of homogeneously adapting agents
obeying strong rationality conditions, the agent-based setting allows to
discuss the effects of heterogeneous and adaptive expectations and enables the
analysis of non-equilibrium trajectories. Starting from a baseline
implementation that matches the asymptotic behavior of the original model, we
show how agent heterogeneity can be accounted for in the aggregate dynamical
equations. We then show that when agents adapt their strategies by a simple
temporal difference learning scheme, the system converges to one of the fixed
points of the original system. Systematic simulations reveal that this is the
only stable equilibrium solution.

challenges to multi-year planning decision making. Second, the long
construction periods of transmission lines may not be able to keep pace with
the fast growing uncertainty due to the increasing integration of renewable

the hourly net load ramping uncertainty (HLRU) set to characterize the
variation of hourly net load including wind power generation, and the annual
net load duration curve uncertainty (LDCU) set for the uncertainty of normal
annual net load duration curve. This results in a two-stage robust optimization

two different sets of subproblems to make the entire solution process

(XOS) is optimized to provide coupled cluster (CC) excitation energies at a
reduced computational cost. In this article, we present an extension of the

seen that the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES\,1011+496 can
be successfully reproduced by synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton emission
models. Notably, the observed curvature in the photon spectrum at X-ray
energies demands a smooth transition of the underlying particle distribution
from a simple power law to a power law with an exponential cutoff or a smooth
broken power law distribution, which may possibly arise when the escape of the
particles from the main emission region is energy dependent. Specifically, if

arcsine Lamperti anomalous diffusions due to their marginal distribution which

In this paper, we study non-linear runtime estimation functions for runtime
estimation. In particular, we study exponential and mixed models for the
estimation of the runtimes of planners. To this end, we evaluate three
different models for runtime on six datasets using 400 link specifications. We

  To automatically extract multiword expressions from a corpus, an extraction

differ from each other widely by construction. We employ different methods to
detect different types of multiword expressions. Given a POS tagged corpus in
English or any Indian language the system initially applies some regular
expression filters to narrow down the search space to certain patterns (like,
reduplication, partial reduplication, compound nouns, compound verbs, conjunct
verbs etc.). The word sequences matching the required pattern are subjected to
a series of linguistic tests which include verb filtering, named entity
filtering and hyphenation filtering test to exclude false positives. The
candidates are then checked for semantic relationships among themselves (using
Wordnet). In order to detect partial reduplication we make use of Wordnet as a
lexical database as well as a tool for lemmatising. We detect complex
predicates by investigating the features of the constituent words. Statistical
methods are applied to detect collocations. Finally, lexicographers examine the
list of automatically extracted candidates to validate whether they are true

convex hull $C_n:=\mathrm{Conv}(S_0,S_1,\dots,S_n)$. Assuming that the tuple
$(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n)$ is exchangeable and a certain general position condition
holds, we prove that the expected number of $k$-dimensional faces of $C_n$ is
given by the formula $$ \mathbb E [f_k(C_n)] = \frac{2\cdot k!}{n!}

i_1<\dots <i_{k+1}\leq n$, the points $S_{i_1},\dots,S_{i_{k+1}}$ form a
$k$-dimensional face of $\mathrm{Conv}(S_0,S_1,\dots,S_n)$. This is done in two
different settings: for random walks with symmetrically exchangeable increments
and for random bridges with exchangeable increments. These results generalize
the classical one-dimensional discrete arcsine law for the position of the
maximum due to E. Sparre Andersen. All our formulae are distribution-free, that
is do not depend on the distribution of the increments $\xi_k$'s.
  The main ingredient in the proof is the computation of the probability that
the origin is absorbed by a joint convex hull of several random walks and
bridges whose increments are invariant with respect to the action of direct
product of finitely many reflection groups of types $A_{n-1}$ and $B_n$. This
probability, in turn, is related to the number of Weyl chambers of a

study both the influence of the Reynolds number and spanwise rotation on
channel flow, the Reynolds number $Re = U_b h/\nu$ is varied from a low 3000 to
a moderate $31\,600$ and the rotation number $Ro = 2 \Omega h/U_b$ is varied
from 0 to 2.7, where $U_b$ is the mean bulk velocity, $h$ the channel half gap
and $\Omega$ the system rotation rate. The mean streamwise velocity profile
displays also at higher $Re$ the characteristic linear part with a slope near
to $2 \Omega$ and a corresponding linear part in the profiles of the production
and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy appears. With increasing $Ro$
a distinct unstable side with large spanwise and wall-normal Reynolds stresses
and a stable side with much weaker turbulence develops in the channel. The flow
starts to relaminarize on the stable side of the channel and persisting
turbulent-laminar patterns appear at higher $Re$. If $Ro$ is further increased
the flow on the stable side becomes laminar-like while at yet higher $Ro$ the
whole flow relaminarizes, although the calm periods might be disrupted by
repeating bursts of turbulence, as explained by Brethouwer (2016). The
influence of the Reynolds number is considerable, in particular on the stable
side of the channel where velocity fluctuations are stronger and the flow
relaminarizes less quickly at higher $Re$. Visualizations and statistics show
that at $Ro=0.15$ and 0.45 large-scale structures and large counter rotating
streamwise roll cells develop on the unstable side. These become less
noticeable and eventually vanish when $Ro$ raises, especially at higher $Re$.
At high $Ro$, the largest energetic structures are larger at lower $Re$.

also allows us to characterize Riccati chain equations geometrically in terms
of the projective vector fields of a flat Riemannian metric and to easily
derive their associated superposition rules. Next, we establish necessary and
sufficient conditions under which it is possible to map second-order Riccati
chain equations into conformal Riccati equations through a local
diffeomorphism. This fact can be used to determine superposition rules for
particular higher-order Riccati chain equations which depend on fewer
particular solutions than in the general case. Therefore, we analyze the
properties of Euclidean, hyperbolic and projective vector fields on the plane
in detail. Finally, the use of contact transformations enables us to apply the

efficiency, customizability, extensibility, and ease of use for novice
programmers. To solve Kassiopeia's target physics problem the software is
capable of simulating particle trajectories governed by arbitrarily complex
differential equations of motion, continuous physics processes that may in part
be modeled as terms perturbing that equation of motion, stochastic processes
that occur in flight such as bulk scattering and decay, and stochastic surface
processes occuring at interfaces, including transmission and reflection
effects. This entire set of computations takes place against the backdrop of a
rich geometry package which serves a variety of roles, including initialization
of electromagnetic field simulations and the support of state-dependent
algorithm-swapping and behavioral changes as a particle's state evolves. Thanks
to the very general approach taken by Kassiopeia it can be used by other
experiments facing similar challenges when calculating particle trajectories in

by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory with shifted boundary
conditions in the time direction. At each given temperature, up to $230\, T_c$
with $T_c$ being the critical temperature, the entropy density is computed at
several lattice spacings so to be able to extrapolate the results to the
continuum limit with confidence. Taken at face value, above a few $T_c$ the
results exhibit a striking linear behaviour in $\ln(T/T_c)^{-1}$ over almost 2
orders of magnitude. Within errors, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann
value but with a slope grossly different from the leading-order perturbative
prediction. The pressure is determined by integrating the entropy in the
temperature, while the energy density is extracted from $T s=(\epsilon + p )$.
The continuum values of the potentials are well represented by Pad\'e
interpolating formulas, which also connect them well to the Stefan-Boltzmann
values in the infinite temperature limit. The pressure, the energy and the
entropy densities are compared with results in the literature. The discrepancy
among previous computations near $T_c$ is analyzed and resolved thanks to the

Although much has been written about its benefits, little is known about the
limitations of globalization, including how immigration affects the
anti-globalist sentiment. Analyzing polls data, we find that over the last
three years in a group of EU countries affected by the recent migrant crisis,
the percentage of right-wing (RW) populist voters in a given country depends on
the prevalence of immigrants in this country's population and the total
immigration inflow into the entire EU. The latter is likely due to the EU
resembling a supranational state, where the lack of inner borders causes that
""somebody else's problem"" easily turns into ""my problem"". We further find that
the increase in the percentage of RW voters substantially surpasses the
immigration inflow, implying that if this process continues, RW populism may
democratically prevail and eventually lead to a demise of globalization. We
present evidence for tipping points in relation to the rise of RW populism.
Finally, we model these empirical findings using a complex network framework
wherein the success of globalization largely rests on the balance between
immigration and immigrant integration.

interest since they allow us to look into physical processes characteristic of
the early Universe, from the assembly of galaxy disks to the formation of stars
in conditions of low metallicity. Given the luminosity-metallicity
relationship, all galaxies fainter than Mr < -13 are expected to be XMPs.
Therefore, XMPs should be common in galaxy surveys. However, they are not,
because several observational biases hamper their detection. This work compares
the number of faint XMPs in the SDSS-DR7 spectroscopic survey with the expected
number, given the known biases and the observed galaxy luminosity function. The
faint end of the luminosity function is poorly constrained observationally, but
it determines the expected number of XMPs. Surprisingly, the number of observed
faint XMPs (around 10) is over-predicted by our calculation, unless the upturn
in the faint end of the luminosity function is not present in the model. The
lack of an upturn can be naturally understood if most XMPs are central galaxies
in their low-mass dark matter halos, which are highly depleted in baryons due
to interaction with the cosmic ultraviolet background and to other physical
processes. Our result also suggests that the upturn towards low luminosity of
the observed galaxy luminosity function is due to satellite galaxies.

geographical maps, and more generally he developed a theory for the distorsion
of mappings between general surfaces. His ideas are at the heart of the work on

production are scrutinized in terms of vorticity alignment with respect to
strain principal axes. For that purpose, a stochastic Lagrangian model for the
velocity gradient tensor and the scalar gradient vector is used. The model
results show that the major part of scalar dissipation occurs for stretched
vorticity, namely when the vorticity vector aligns with the extensional and
intermediate strain eigenvectors. More specifically, it appears that the mean
scalar dissipation is well represented by the sample defined by alignment with
the extensional strain, while the most intense scalar dissipation is promoted
by the set of events for which vorticity aligns with the intermediate strain.
This difference is explained by rather subtle mechanisms involving the
statistics of both the strain intensities and the scalar gradient alignment
resulting from these special alignments of vorticity. The analysis allowing for
the local flow structure confirms the latter scenario for both the strain-and
rotation-dominated events. However, despite the prevailing role of strain in
promoting scalar dissipation, the difference in the level of scalar dissipation
when vorticity aligns with either the extensional or the intermediate strain
mostly arises from rotation-dominated events.

complex environments, which is flight through narrow gaps. While previous works
relied on off-board localization systems or on accurate prior knowledge of the
gap position and orientation, we rely solely on onboard sensing and computing
and estimate the full state by fusing gap detection from a single onboard
camera with an IMU. This problem is challenging for two reasons: (i) the
quadrotor pose uncertainty with respect to the gap increases quadratically with
the distance from the gap; (ii) the quadrotor has to actively control its
orientation towards the gap to enable state estimation (i.e., active vision).
We solve this problem by generating a trajectory that considers geometric,
dynamic, and perception constraints: during the approach maneuver, the
quadrotor always faces the gap to allow state estimation, while respecting the
vehicle dynamics; during the traverse through the gap, the distance of the
quadrotor to the edges of the gap is maximized. Furthermore, we replan the
trajectory during its execution to cope with the varying uncertainty of the
state estimate. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approach
in many real experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that addresses and achieves autonomous, aggressive flight through narrow gaps
using only onboard sensing and computing and without prior knowledge of the
pose of the gap.

enables an agent having multi-link body structure to discover its kinematic
structure, i.e., body schema, from tactile information alone. The DPGMM-LJ is a
probabilistic model based on Bayesian nonparametrics and an extension of
Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). In a simulation experiment,
we used a simple fetus model that had five body parts and performed structured
random movements in a womb-like environment. It was shown that the method could
estimate the number of body parts and kinematic structures without any
pre-existing knowledge in many cases. Another experiment showed that the degree
of motor coordination in random movements affects the result of body schema
formation strongly. It is confirmed that the accuracy rate for body schema
estimation had the highest value 84.6% when the ratio of motor coordination was
0.9 in our setting. These results suggest that kinematic structure can be
estimated from tactile information obtained by a fetus moving randomly in a
womb without any visual information even though its accuracy was not so high.
They also suggest that a certain degree of motor coordination in random
movements and the sufficient dimension of state space that represents the body
map are important to estimate body schema correctly.

asymptotic consensus given the topology of the graph. The controller depends
only on relative information of the agents. Since finding the control gain for
such controller is hard, we focus on finding an optimal controller among a
classical family of controllers which is based on Algebraic Riccati Equation
(ARE) and guarantees asymptotic consensus. Through analysis, we find that the
energy cost is bounded by an interval and hence we minimize the upper bound. In
order to do that, there are two classes of variables that need to be optimized:
the control gain and the edge weights of the graph and are hence designed from
two perspectives. A suboptimal control gain is obtained by choosing $Q=0$ in
the ARE. Negative edge weights are allowed, and the problem is formulated as a
Semi-definite Programming (SDP) problem. Having negative edge weights means
that ""competitions"" between the agents are allowed. The motivation behind this
setting is to have a better system performance. We provide a different proof
from the angle of optimization and show that the lowest control energy cost is
reached when the graph is complete and with equal edge weights. Furthermore,
two sufficient conditions for the existence of negative optimal edge weights
realization are given.

that these particle sizes are clearly outside the range of validity of the
point-particle approximation, as has been shown by Homann & Bec (2010). At the
present parameter points the global effect of the particles upon the fluid flow
is weak. We observe that the dispersed phase exhibits clustering with moderate
intensity. The tendency to cluster, which was quantified in terms of the
standard deviation of Voronoi cell volumes, decreases with the particle
diameter. We have analyzed the relation between particle locations and the
location of intense vortical flow structures. The results do not reveal any
significant statistical correlation. Contrarily, we have detected a small but
statistically significant preferential location of particles with respect to
the `sticky points' proposed by Goto & Vassilicos (2008), i.e. points where the
fluid acceleration field is acting such as to increase the local particle
concentration in one-way coupled point-particle models under Stokes drag. The
presently found statistical correlation between the `sticky points' and the
particle locations further increases when focusing on regions with high local
concentration. Our results suggest that small finite-size particles can be
brought together along the expansive directions of the fluid acceleration
field, as previously observed only for the simplest model for sub-Kolmogorov

to doubly-resonant diagrams that overlap with $t \bar t$, and similarly for

remove this overlap, thus avoiding double counting and separating the two
processes. In Diagram Removal 1, the amplitudes of doubly-resonant diagrams are
set to zero, which also removes the interference of $Wt$ with $t \bar t$. If a
measurement is performed in a region where this interference is not negligible,
it would be of interest to take it into account. Another method, Diagram
Subtraction, preserves the interference. However, it relies upon momentum
reshuffling, which introduces uncertainties to the prediction. An alternative

  Selling Stored Energy in Regulated and Unregulated Power Markets","26 pages",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is concerned with the application of game theoretic principles to
model competition between demand response aggregators for selling excess energy
stored in electrochemical storage devices directly to other aggregators in a
power market. This market framework is presented as an alternative to the
traditional vertically integrated market structure, which may be better suited
for developing demand response and smart grid technologies, in addition to
increasing penetration of independent renewable energy generation devices.
Demand for power generated by the utility through combustion of fuel could be
replaced, lowering emission of pollutants, when the energy used to charge the
batteries is produced sustainably and traded on smaller scales. The four
variants of game are considered: both non-cooperative (unregulated competition)
and Stackelberg (regulations on transaction price and size), each with and
without DR scheduling. The Nash equilibrium is derived for each game variant in
order to serve as a bid-price decision making criteria which determines the
optimal bidding strategy for an aggregator to sell in the market. The model is
applied to a case study involving completion for selling between two
aggregators. Bidding strategy is dependent on parameters inherent to an
aggregator's energy storage hardware, and the strategy selected by each
aggregator does not vary with the variations in the game conditions considered.
Demand response scheduling offers greater payoff for aggregators who implement
it, compared with those who do not. Addition of transaction price and volume
regulations to the market do not affect the participants optimal bidding
strategies (the Nash equilibrium), but lowers payoffs for all aggregators
participating in the market relative to unregulated competition.

relational data arising in several domains. One of the most important aspect of
network analysis is community detection or network clustering. Until recently,
the major focus have been on discovering community structure in single (i.e.,

modalities, multiplex networks, i.e., networks composed of multiple layers
representing different aspects of relations, have emerged. Consequently,
community detection in multiplex network, i.e., detecting clusters of nodes

Network Fusion for Composite Community Extraction (NF-CCE), a new class of
algorithms, based on four different non-negative matrix factorization models,
capable of extracting composite communities in multiplex networks. Each
algorithm works in two steps: first, it finds a non-negative, low-dimensional
feature representation of each network layer; then, it fuses the feature
representation of layers into a common non-negative, low-dimensional feature
representation via collective factorization. The composite clusters are
extracted from the common feature representation. We demonstrate the superior

  or Child/Adult Mortality",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BACKGROUND. The majority of countries in Africa and nearly one third of all
countries require mortality models to infer complete age schedules of
mortality, required for population estimates, projections/forecasts and many
other tasks in demography and epidemiology. Models that relate child mortality
to mortality at other ages are important because all countries have measures of
child mortality.
  OBJECTIVE. 1) Design a general model for age-specific mortality that provides
a standard way to relate covariates to age-specific mortality. 2) Calibrate
that model using the relationship between child or child/adult mortality and
mortality at other ages. 3) Validate the calibrated model and compare its
performance to existing models.
  METHODS. A general, parametrizable component model of mortality is designed
using the singular value decomposition (SVD-Comp) and calibrated to the
relationship between child or child/adult mortality and mortality at other ages
in the observed mortality schedules of the Human Mortality Database. Cross
validation is used to validate the model, and the predictive performance of the
model is compared to that of the Log-Quad model, designed to do the same thing.
  RESULTS. Prediction and cross validation tests indicate that the child
mortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is able to accurately represent the observed
mortality schedules in the Human Mortality Database, is robust to the selection
of mortality schedules used to calibrate it, and performs better than the
Log-Quad Model.
  CONCLUSIONS. The child mortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is a useful tool that
can be used where child mortality is available but mortality at other ages is
unknown. Together with earlier work on an HIV prevalence-calibrated version of
SVD-Comp, this work suggests that this approach is truly general and could be
used to develop a wide range of additional useful models.

  Sampled Data with Application to eGFR","Preprint submitted to Journal of Biomedical Informatics",,,,"q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order for clinicians to manage disease progression and make effective
decisions about drug dosage, treatment regimens or scheduling follow up
appointments, it is necessary to be able to identify both short and long-term
trends in repeated biomedical measurements. However, this is complicated by the
fact that these measurements are irregularly sampled and influenced by both
genuine physiological changes and external factors. In their current forms,
existing regression algorithms often do not fulfil all of a clinician's
requirements for identifying short-term events while still being able to
identify long-term trends in disease progression. Therefore, in order to
balance both short term interpretability and long term flexibility, an
extension to broken-stick regression models is proposed in order to make them
more suitable for modelling clinical time series. The proposed probabilistic
broken-stick model can robustly estimate both short-term and long-term trends
simultaneously, while also accommodating the unequal length and irregularly
sampled nature of clinical time series. Moreover, since the model is parametric
and completely generative, its first derivative provides a long-term non-linear
estimate of the annual rate of change in the measurements more reliably than
linear regression. The benefits of the proposed model are illustrated using
estimated glomerular filtration rate as a case study for managing patients with
chronic kidney disease.

excitability of Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) resonances in isotropic plates is
investigated both theoretically and experimentally for axially symmetric
sources. Optimal parameters and amplitude gains are derived analytically for
spot and annular sources of either Gaussian or rectangular energy profiles. For
a Gaussian spot source, the optimal radius is found to be $\lambda_{ZGV}/\pi$.
Annular sources increase the amplitude by at least a factor of 3 compared to
the optimal Gaussian source. Rectangular energy profiles provide higher gain
than Gaussian ones. These predictions are confirmed by semi-analytical
simulation of the thermoelastic generation of Lamb waves, including the effect
of material attenuation. Experimentally, Gaussian ring sources of controlled
width and radius are produced with an axicon-lens system. Measured optimal
geometric parameters obtained for Gaussian and annular beams are in good
agreement with theoretical predictions. A ZGV resonance amplification factor of
2.1 is obtained with the Gaussian ring. Such source should facilitate the
inspection of highly attenuating plates made of low ablation threshold

The amount of visitors a place received, the distribution of distance traveled
