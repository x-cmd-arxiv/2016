Schwartz kernel of the complex powers of $m$-Laplace type operators $L$ on
compact Riemannian manifolds in terms of Riesz distributions. The constant term
in this asymptotic expansion turns turns out to be given by the local zeta
function of $L$. In particular, the constant term in the asymptotic expansion
of the Green's function $L^{-1}$ is often called the mass of $L$, which (in
case that $L$ is the Yamabe operator) is an important invariant, namely a
positive multiple of the ADM mass of a certain asymptotically flat manifold
constructed out of the given data. We show that for general conformally
invariant $m$-Laplace operators $L$ (including the GJMS operators), this mass
is a conformal invariant in the case that the dimension of $M$ is odd and that
$\ker L = 0$, and we give a precise description of the failure of the conformal
invariance in the case that these conditions are not satisfied.

$hp$-adaptive finite element method are applied to partial differential
equations arising in quantum mechanics, namely, the Schr\""odinger equation with
Coulomb and harmonic potentials, and the Poisson problem. Implementational
details of the partition-of-unity method related to enforcing continuity with
hanging nodes and the degeneracy of the basis are discussed. The
partition-of-unity method is equipped with an a posteriori error estimator,
thus enabling implementation of error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement
strategies. To that end, local interpolation error estimates are derived for
the partition-of-unity method enriched with a class of exponential functions.
The results are the same as for the finite element method and thereby admit the
usage of standard residual error indicators. The efficiency of the $h$-adaptive
partition-of-unity method is compared to the $h$- and $hp$-adaptive finite
element method. The latter is implemented by adopting the analyticity estimate
from Legendre coefficients. An extension of this approach to multiple solution
vectors is proposed. Numerical results confirm the remarkable accuracy of the
$h$-adaptive partition-of-unity approach. In case of the Hydrogen atom, the
$h$-adaptive linear partition-of-unity method was found to be comparable to the
$hp$-adaptive finite element method for the target eigenvalue accuracy of
$10^{-3}$.

major challenge for theoretical methods that rely on analytic continuation of
correlations functions obtained numerically in Matsubara space. While maximum
entropy methods can be used for certain correlation functions, this is not
possible in general, important examples being the Seebeck, Hall, Nernst and
Reggi-Leduc coefficients. Indeed, positivity of the spectral weight on the
positive real-frequency axis is not guaranteed in these cases. The spectral
weight can even be complex in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry.
Various workarounds, such as the neglect of vertex corrections or the study of
the infinite frequency or Kelvin limits have been proposed. Here, we show that
one can define auxiliary response functions that allow to extract the desired
real-frequency susceptibilities from maximum entropy methods in the most
general multiorbital cases with no particular symmetry. As a benchmark case, we
study the longitudinal thermoelectric response and corresponding Onsager
coefficient in the single-band two-dimensional Hubbard model treated with
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo

detailed modelling of the evolutionary processes that shape galaxies. We
analyse the nature of M31's triaxial bulge with an extensive set of N-body
models, which include Box/Peanut (B/P) bulges as well as initial classical
bulges (ICBs). Comparing with IRAC 3.6$\mu m$ data, only one model matches
simultaneously all the morphological properties of M31's bulge, and requires an
ICB and a B/P bulge with 1/3 and 2/3 of the total bulge mass respectively. We
find that our pure B/P bulge models do not show concentrations high enough to
match the S\'ersic index ($n$) and the effective radius of M31's bulge.
Instead, the best model requires an ICB component with mass $M^{\rm
ICB}=1.1\times10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and three-dimensional half-mass radius
$r_{\rm half}^{\rm ICB}$=0.53 kpc (140 arcsec). The B/P bulge component has a
mass of $M^{\rm B/P}=2.2\times10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a half-mass radius of
$r_{\rm half}^{\rm B/P}$=1.3 kpc (340 arcsec). The model's B/P bulge extends to
$r^{\rm B/P}$=3.2 kpc (840 arcsec) in the plane of the disk, as does M31's
bulge. In this composite bulge model, the ICB component explains the velocity
dispersion drop observed in the centre within $R<$190 pc (50 arcsec), while the
B/P bulge component reproduces the observed rapid rotation and the kinematic
twist of the observed zero velocity line. This model's pattern speed is
$\Omega_p$=38 km/s/kpc, placing corotation at $r_{\rm cor}$=5.8 kpc (1500
arcsec). The outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) is then at $r_{\rm OLR}$=10.4kpc,
near the 10kpc-ring of M31, suggesting that this structure may be related to
the bar's OLR. By comparison with an earlier snapshot, we estimate that M31's
thin bar extends to $r_{\rm bar}^{\rm thin}\sim$4.0 kpc (1000 arcsec) in the

with $p$-wave interaction in two dimensions, simply using the short-range
asymptotic behavior of fermion-pair wave functions. For $p$-wave interactions,
an additional contact related to the effective range needs to be introduced,
besides the one related to the scattering volume. Since the subleading tail
($k^{-4}$) of the large-momentum distribution cannot fully be captured by the
contacts defined by the adiabatic relations, an extra term resulted from the
center-of-mass motions of the pairs gives rise to an additional divergence in
the kinetic energy of the system, besides those related to the contacts
defined. We show in Tan's energy theorem that if only two-body correlations are
taken into account, all these divergences are reasonably removed, leading to a
finite internal energy of the system. In addition, we find that all the other
universal relations, such as the high-frequency behavior of the radio-frequency
response, short-range behavior of the pair correlation function, generalized
virial theorem, and pressure relation, remain unaffected by the center-of-mass
motions of the pairs, and are fully governed by the contacts defined by the
adiabatic relations. Our results confirm the feasibility of generalizing the
contact theory for higher-partial-wave scatterings, and could readily be
confirmed in current experiments with ultracold $^{40}$K and $^{6}$Li atoms.

time-dependent boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric
asymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure
of the HP, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is
demonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the HP creates
consecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are
magnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation
of abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by
Voyager 1 when it was crossing the HP structure for a period of about one month
in the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting
simulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ

the HP is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. We discuss the
transport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath,
concentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the
pitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the

While this omission seems not to impact the detection of sources having mass
ratios and spins similar to those of GW150914, even for total masses $M >
200M_{\odot}$; we show that it can cause large fractional losses of sensitive
volume for binaries with mass ratio $q \geq 4$ and $M>100M_{\odot}$, measured

the source is face-on to the detector. Quantitatively, we show that the
aforementioned omission can lead to fractional losses of sensitive volume of
$\sim15\%$, reaching $>25\%$ for the worst cases studied. Loss estimates are
obtained by evaluating the effectualness of the SEOBNRv2-ROM double spin model,
currently used in binary black hole searches, towards gravitational wave
signals from precessing binaries computed by means of numerical relativity. We
conclude that, for sources with $q \geq 4$, a reliable search for binary black
holes heavier than $M>100M_\odot$ needs to consider the effects of higher order
modes and precession. The latter seems specially necessary when Advanced LIGO
reaches its design sensitivity.

that colliding jets can be cast into two categories: 1) bouncing jets, in which
case the jets bounce off each other keeping their identities, and 2) merging
jets, when only one jet emerges from the collision. Under some conditions the
interaction causes the jets to break up into oscillating filaments of opposite
helicity, with consequences for their downstream stability. When one jet is
significantly faster than the other and the impact parameter is small, the jets
merge; the faster jet takes over the slower one. In the case of merging jets,
the oscillations of the filaments, in projection, may show a feature which
resembles a double helix, similar to the radio image of 3C 75. Thus we
interpret the morphology of 3C 75 as a consequence of the collision of two jets
with distinctly different speeds at a small impact parameter, with the faster
jet breaking up into two oscillating filaments.

outgoing $\pi N$ invariant masses below 1.4 GeV. Our motivation is to get a
better description of the $\nu_\mu n\to\mu^- n\pi^+$ cross section, for which
current theoretical models give values significantly below data. This channel
is very sensitive to the crossed $\Delta (1232)$ contribution and thus to spin
1/2 components in the Rarita-Schwinger $\Delta$ propagator. We show how these
spin 1/2 components are nonpropagating and give rise to contact interactions.
In this context, we point out that the discrepancy with experiment might be
corrected by the addition of appropriate extra contact terms and argue that
this procedure will provide a natural solution to the $\nu_\mu n\to\mu^-
n\pi^+$ puzzle. To keep our model simple, in this work we propose to change the
strength of the spin 1/2 components in the $\Delta$ propagator and use the
$\nu_\mu n\to\mu^- n\pi^+$ data to constraint its value. With this
modification, we now find a good reproduction of the $\nu_\mu n\to\mu^- n\pi^+$
cross section without affecting the good results previously obtained for the
other channels. We also explore how this change in the $\Delta$ propagator
affects our predictions for pion photoproduction and find also a better

novelty of the game is that the game definition embeds a \textit{coalition

the game into partition-specific strategy domains, what makes every partition
to be a non-cooperative game with partition-specific payoffs for every player.
The mechanism includes a maximum coalition size, a set of eligible partitions
with coalitions sizes no greater than this number (which also serves as a
restriction for a maximum number of deviators) and a coalition structure
formation rule. The paper defines a family of nested non-cooperative games
parametrized by a size of a maximum coalition size. Every game in the family
has an equilibrium in mixed strategies. The equilibrium can generate more than
one coalition and encompasses intra and inter group externalities, what makes
it different from the Shapley value. Presence of individual payoff allocation
makes it different from a strong Nash, coalition-proof equilibrium, and some

multiple experiments, increases linearly with the number of experiments. A
recently proposed method to decrease this cost uses only a small number of
random linear combinations of all experiments for solving the inverse problem.
This approach applies to inverse problems where the PDE solution depends
linearly on the right-hand side function that models the experiment. As this
method is stochastic in essence, the quality of the obtained reconstructions
can vary, in particular when only a small number of combinations are used. We
develop a Bayesian formulation for the definition and computation of encoding
weights that lead to a parameter reconstruction with the least uncertainty. We
call these weights A-optimal encoding weights. Our framework applies to inverse
problems where the governing PDE is nonlinear with respect to the inversion
parameter field. We formulate the problem in infinite dimensions and follow the
optimize-then-discretize approach, devoting special attention to the
discretization and the choice of numerical methods in order to achieve a
computational cost that is independent of the parameter discretization. We
elaborate our method for a Helmholtz inverse problem, and derive the
adjoint-based expressions for the gradient of the objective function of the
optimization problem for finding the A-optimal encoding weights. The proposed
method is potentially attractive for real-time monitoring applications, where
one can invest the effort to compute optimal weights offline, to later solve an
inverse problem repeatedly, over time, at a fraction of the initial cost.

the usual gapped bands with an effective, RSOC-dependent Zeeman field due to
the interplay of SDI. Using these bands we obtain the closed analytical

the dielectric function corresponds to the collective mode. Upon including the
full dispersion of graphene on TMDC, we find that there is in fact only one

that cluster galaxies are on average 1.6 mags brighter and a factor 2-3
smaller. We tentatively divided our cluster galaxies by total mass (i.e., Vmax)
to investigate a possible mass dependency in the environmental evolution of
galaxies. The average deviation from the local B-band TFR is -0.7 mags for the
high-mass subsample. This mild evolution may be driven by younger stellar
populations of distant galaxies with respect to their local counterparts, and
thus, an increasing luminosity is expected towards higher redshifts. However,
the low-mass group is made of 3 highly overluminous galaxies with average TFR
offsets of -2.4 mags. This deviation can no longer be explained by the gradual
evolution of SP with lookback time and thus, we suspect that we see rather
compact galaxies that got an enhancement of star formation during their infall

Borodin-Okounkov formula or a Riemann-Hilbert problem for integrable operators.
Our approach to the $L^{1}$-phase is based on a generalization of the
construction in Berestycki \cite{Berestycki15} to random fields which are only
\textit{asymptotically} Gaussian. In particular, our method could have
applications to other random fields coming from either random matrix theory or
a different context.

transitioned from reflectance modeling using in-lab controlled radiometric

materials captured in the scene. We propose to take a middle-ground approach
for material recognition that takes advantage of both rich radiometric cues and

The database consists of over 30,000 images covering 40 classes of outdoor
ground terrain under varying weather and lighting conditions. We develop a
novel approach for material recognition called a Differential Angular Imaging

recognition performance that surpasses single view or coarsely quantized
multiview images. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of differential

and the cell area falling inside the deployment domain would have different

calculate the second moment of cell area at two locations for the seed: (i) at
the corner of a quadrant, and (ii) at the boundary of the half-plane. We
illustrate that the two-parameter Gamma distribution, with location-dependent

network (MSN) and its analysis. One of the crucial problems in multi-layered
social network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the
CLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the
thesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two
given users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm
for community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The
algorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and
multi-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN
Benchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special
extension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to
produce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem
considered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem
have led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution
Discovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups
in successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a
real social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding
accuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a
new approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was
developed. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It
is shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several
preceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned
model can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.

originating from regional fire activity. Despite a variety of methods to
identify local fires from sediment charcoal records, an integrated statistical
framework for fire reconstruction is lacking. We develop a Bayesian point
process model to estimate probability of fire associated with charcoal counts
from individual-lake sediments and estimate mean fire return intervals. A
multivariate extension of the model combines records from multiple lakes to
reduce uncertainty in local fire identification and estimate a regional mean
fire return interval. The univariate and multivariate models are applied to 13
lakes in the Yukon Flats region of Alaska. Both models resulted in similar mean
fire return intervals (100-350 years) with reduced uncertainty under the
multivariate model due to improved estimation of regional charcoal deposition.
The point process model offers an integrated statistical framework for
paleo-fire reconstruction and extends existing methods to infer regional fire
history from multiple lake records with uncertainty following directly from
posterior distributions.

$O(n^{11/6})$ upper bound on the number of solutions of trivariate polynomial

geometry.
  We prove that there exist bounded-degree algebraic decision trees of depth
$O(n^{\frac{12}{7}+\varepsilon})$ that solve 3POL, and that 3POL can be solved
in $O(n^2 {(\log \log n)}^\frac{3}{2} / {(\log n)}^\frac{1}{2})$ time in the

to solve GPT in subquadratic time when the input points lie on $o({(\log

curves. This constitutes a first step towards closing the major open question
of whether GPT can be solved in subquadratic time.

(MSSM) refer to the parameter regions where the couplings of the DM particles
to the $Z$-boson or the Higgs boson are almost zero, leading to vanishingly
small signals for the DM direct detections. In this paper, we carry out
comprehensive analyses for the DM searches under the blind-spot scenarios in
MSSM. Guided by the requirement of acceptable DM relic abundance, we explore
the complementary coverage for the theory parameters at the LHC, the projection
for the future underground DM direct searches, and the indirect searches from
the relic DM annihilation into photons and neutrinos. We find that (i) the
spin-independent (SI) blind spots may be rescued by the spin-dependent (SD)
direct detection in the future underground experiments, and possibly by the
indirect DM detections from IceCube and SuperK neutrino experiments; (ii) the
detection of gamma rays from Fermi-LAT may not reach the desirable sensitivity
for searching for the DM blind-spot regions; (iii) the SUSY searches at the LHC
will substantially extend the discovery region for the blind-spot parameters.
The dark matter blind spots thus may be unblinded with the collective efforts
in future DM searches.

are hosts to planet candidates or confirmed planets were observed. We combine
measurements of companions to KOI host stars from different bands to create a
comprehensive catalog of projected separations, position angles, and magnitude
differences for all detected companion stars (some of which may not be bound).
Our compilation includes 2297 companions around 1903 primary stars. From
high-resolution imaging, we find that ~10% (~30%) of the observed stars have at
least one companion detected within 1"" (4""). The true fraction of systems with
close (< ~4"") companions is larger than the observed one due to the limited
sensitivities of the imaging data. We derive correction factors for planet
radii caused by the dilution of the transit depth: assuming that planets orbit
the primary stars or the brightest companion stars, the average correction
factors are 1.06 and 3.09, respectively. The true effect of transit dilution
lies in between these two cases and varies with each system. Applying these
factors to planet radii decreases the number of KOI planets with radii smaller
than 2 R_Earth by ~2-23% and thus affects planet occurrence rates. This effect
will also be important for the yield of small planets from future transit
missions such as TESS.

$\gamma$-ray emitting region for a given flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In
the model, the extra-relativistic electrons are injected at the base of the jet
and non-thermal photons are produced by both synchrotron radiation and
inverse-Comtpon (IC) scattering in the energy dissipation region. The target
photons dominating inverse-Comtpon scattering originate from both synchrotron
photons and external ambient photon fields, and the energy density of external
radiation field is a function of the distance between the position of
dissipation region and a central super-massive black hole, and their spectra
are seen in the comoving frame. Moreover, the energy dissipation region could
be determined by the model parameter through reproducing the $\gamma$-ray
spectra. Such a model is applied to reproduce the quasi-simultaneous
multi-wavelength observed data for 36 FSRQs. In order to define the width of
the broad-line region shell and dusty molecular torus shell, a simple numerical
constraint is used to determine the outer boundary of the broad-line region and
dusty molecular torus. Our results show that 1) the $\gamma$-ray emitting
regions are located at the range from 0.1 pc to 10 pc; 2) the $\gamma$-ray
emitting regions are located outside the broad-line regions and within the
dusty molecular tori; and 3) the $\gamma$-ray emitting region are located
closer to the dusty molecular torus ranges than the broad-line regions.
Therefore, it may concluded that a direct evidence for the \emph{far site}
scenario could be obtained on the basis of the model results.

influencing how such systems relax via quantum tunneling of magnetization
(QTM). By reducing a system's symmetry, through the application of a magnetic
field or uniaxial pressure, these dynamics can be modified. We report
measurements of the magnetization dynamics of a crystalline sample of the
high-symmetry [Mn12O12(O2CMe)16(MeOH)4]MeOH single-molecule magnet as a
function of uniaxial pressure applied either parallel or perpendicular to the
sample's ""easy"" magnetization axis. At temperatures between 1.8 and 3.3 K,
magnetic hysteresis loops exhibit the characteristic steplike features that
signal the occurrence of QTM. After applying uniaxial pressure to the sample in
situ, both the magnitude and field position of the QTM steps changed. The step
magnitudes were observed to grow as a function of pressure in both arrangements
of pressure, while pressure applied along (perpendicular to) the sample's easy
axis caused the resonant-tunneling fields to increase (decrease). These
observations were compared with simulations in which the system's Hamiltonian
parameters were changed. From these comparisons, we determined that parallel
pressure induces changes to the second-order axial anisotropy parameter as well
as either the fourth-order axial or fourth-order transverse parameter, or to
both. In addition, we find that pressure applied perpendicular to the easy axis
induces a rhombic anisotropy E ~ D/2000 per kbar that can be understood as
deriving from a symmetry-breaking distortion of the molecule.

both pairs of opposite sides having comparable lengths.
  For rectangular elements our interpolation error estimate agrees with the
usual one whereas for perturbations of rectangles (the most general
quadrilateral elements previously considered as far as we know) our result has
some advantages with respect to the pre-existing ones: the interpolation error
estimate that we proved is written by using two neighboring sides of the
element instead of the sides of the unknown perturbed rectangle and, on the
other hand, conditions $MAC$ and $clos$ are much simpler requirements to verify
and with a clearer geometrical sense than those involved in the definition of
perturbations of a rectangle.

of successive CMEs in the corona and inner heliosphere, focusing on the
initiation of series of CMEs, their interaction in the heliosphere, the
particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs, and the effect of
compound events on Earth's magnetosphere. The two main mechanisms resulting in
the eruption of series of CMEs are sympathetic eruptions and homologous
eruptions. The interaction of successive CMEs has been observed remotely in
coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and inferred from in situ measurements.
It is associated with magnetic reconnection, momentum exchange, the propagation
of a fast magnetosonic shock through a magnetic ejecta and changes in CME
expansion. The presence of a CME a few hours before a fast eruption is
connected with higher fluxes of SEPs, while CME-CME interaction occurring in
the corona is often associated with unusual radio bursts. Higher suprathermal
population, enhanced turbulence and wave activity, stronger shocks, and
shock-shock or shock-CME interaction have been proposed as physical mechanisms
to explain these SEP events. When measured in situ, CME-CME interaction may be
associated with relatively well organized multiple-magnetic cloud events,
instances of shocks propagating through a previous magnetic ejecta or more
complex ejecta. The compression of a CME by another and the propagation of a
shock inside a magnetic ejecta can lead to extreme values of the southward
magnetic field, sometimes associated with large values of the dynamic pressure.
This can result in intense geomagnetic storms, but also trigger substorms and
large earthward motions of the magnetopause, potentially associated with
changes in the outer radiation belts. Future measurements by Solar Probe+ and
Solar Orbiter may shed light on the evolution of CMEs as they interact.

restored quark matter, which result from the large angular momentum in
non-central collisions, can generate an axial charge dipole moment in the
transverse plane of a heavy ion collision, it does not produce a difference in
the eccentricities of negatively and positively charged particles. As a result,
including the chiral vortical effect alone cannot lead to a splitting between
the elliptic flows of negatively and positively charged particles. On the other
hand, negatively and positively charged particles do develop a splitting in
their elliptic flows if the effect due to a strong and long-lived magnetic
field is also included. However, to have a positive slope in the dependence of
the elliptic flow splitting on the charge asymmetry of the quark matter, as
seen in experiments, requires the neglect of the effect of the Lorentz force.
In this case, an elliptic flow splitting appears even at vanishing charge
asymmetry.

previous work cannot reproduce the persistent argon enhancement observed over
the western maria. They also fail to match the observed local time of the
near-sunrise peak in argon density, which is the same for the highland and mare

ubiquitous desorption energy of 28 kJ/mol. A localised source can explain the
observations, with a trade-off between an unexpectedly localised source or an
unexpectedly brief lifetime of argon atoms in the exosphere. To match the
observations, a point-like source requires source and loss rates of
~$1.9\times10^{21}$ atoms/s. A more diffuse source, weighted by the
near-surface potassium, requires much higher rates of ~$1.1\times10^{22}$
atoms/s, corresponding to a mean lifetime of just 1.4 lunar days. We do not
address the mechanism for producing a localised source, but demonstrate that
this appears to be the only model that can reproduce the observations. Large,
seasonally varying cold traps could explain the long-term fluctuation in the

the $\sim 5$--70 TeV cosmic-ray electron spectrum. Further, we show that HAWC
can immediately make an even stronger test with nondirectional observations of
cosmic-ray electrons. Together, these gamma-ray and electron studies will

rope-like, twisted bundles and fibers by introducing gradients of both filament
shape (i.e. curvature) and packing throughout the structure. Previous models of
chiral filament bundle formation have shown that this frustration gives rise to
several distinct morphological responses, including self-limiting bundle
widths, anisotropic domain (tape-like) formation and topological defects in the
lateral inter-filament order. In this paper, we employ a combination of
continuum elasticity theory and discrete filament bundle simulations to explore
how these distinct morphological responses compete in the broader phase diagram

formation exhibits at least four classes of equilibrium structure --
finite-width, twisted bundles with isotropic and anisotropic shapes, with and
without topological defects, as well as bulk phases of untwisted, columnar
assembly (i.e. ""frustration escape""). These competing equilibrium morphologies
are selected by only a relatively small number of parameters describing
filament assembly: bundle surface energy, preferred chiral twist and stiffness
of chiral filament interactions, and mechanical stiffness of filaments and
their lateral interactions. Discrete filament bundle simulations test and
verify continuum theory predictions for dependence of bundle structure (shape,

progress in the theory of turbulent magnetic relaxation to specify a
dissipative closure of the stationary magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind equations,
yielding predictions of the magnetic energy dissipation rate throughout the

model's efficacy, we show that it can reproduce many features of the Crab
Nebula, including its expansion speed, radiative efficiency, peak photon
energy, and mean magnetic field strength. Unlike ideal MHD models of the Crab
(which lead to the so-called sigma problem) our model accounts for the
transition from ultra to weakly magnetized plasma flow, and for the associated
heating of relativistic electrons. We discuss how the predicted heating rates
may be utilized to improve upon models of particle transport and acceleration

experience periodic pulsed accretion events as streams of material form at the
inner edge of a circumbinary disk, cross a dynamically cleared gap, and feed
circumstellar disks or accrete directly onto the stars. The archetype for the
pulsed-accretion theory is the eccentric, short-period, classical T Tauri
binary DQ Tau. Low-cadence (~daily) broadband photometry has shown brightening
events near most periastron passages, just as numerical simulations would
predict for an eccentric binary. Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during
the collision of stellar magnetospheres near periastron could, however, produce
the same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. To
reveal the dominate physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau's low-cadence
observations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multi-band
photometry over 10 orbital periods, supplemented with 27 nights of
minute-cadence photometry centered on 4 separate periastron passages. While
both accretion and stellar flares are present, the dominant timescale and
morphology of brightening events are characteristic of accretion. On average,
the mass accretion rate increases by a factor of 5 near periastron, in good
agreement with recent models. Large variability is observed in the morphology
and amplitude of accretion events from orbit-to-orbit. We argue this is due to
the absence of stable circumstellar disks around each star, compounded by
inhomogeneities at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and within the
accretion streams themselves. Quasi-periodic apastron accretion events are also
observed, which are not predicted by binary accretion theory.

the $J-K$ versus $W_1-W_2$ diagram and very cool temperatures ($J-K>0.7$). They
overlap with the reference pre-main sequence RAVE stars often displaying X-ray

to an additional process. Here we assume the additional process corresponds to
the weak r-process or alpha-process taking place in neutrino-driven winds.
Based on a trajectory obtained from hydrodynamical simulations we study the

the uncertainties of the statistical model and its nuclear physics input,
mainly alpha optical potentials under the conditions found in the wind. Our
results show that $(\alpha,n)$ reactions are indeed very important to predict

critical reactions. Since the nucleosynthesis path is close to stability, these
reactions can be measured in the near future. This will uniquely allow to
reduce the nuclear physics uncertainties and thus to use observations to

gives rise to a strong quasiparticle drift in the direction perpendicular to

Boltzmann kinetic equation with sample electrostatics, we develop a microscopic
theory of magnetotransport in two and three spatial dimensions. The compensated
Hall effect in confined geometry is always accompanied by electron-hole
recombination near the sample edges and at large-scale inhomogeneities. As the
result, classical edge currents may dominate the resistance in the vicinity of
charge compensation. The effect leads to linear magnetoresistance in two
dimensions in a broad range of parameters. In three dimensions, the
magnetoresistance is normally quadratic in the field, with the linear regime
restricted to rectangular samples with magnetic field directed perpendicular to
the sample surface. Finally, we discuss the effects of heat flow and

this paper, we present a protocol capable of transferring a quantum state

asymptotically independent of $L$; if $\alpha = d$, the time is logarithmic in

$L^{\alpha - d}$; and if $\alpha \geq d + 1$, it occurs in time proportional to

state specified by a MERA (multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz)

then it can be created in time that scales with $L$ identically to state

implications for baryogenesis. In particular, as highlighted recently, the CKM
matrix alone could be the source of CP-violation during electroweak
baryogenesis provided that the Yukawa couplings were large and varied during
the electroweak phase transition. We provide a natural realisation of this idea
in the context of Randall-Sundrum models and show that the geometrical warped
approach to the fermion mass hierarchy may naturally display the desired
cosmological dynamics. The key ingredient is the coupling of the
Goldberger-Wise scalar, responsible for the IR brane stabilisation, to the bulk
fermions, which modifies the fermionic profiles. This also helps alleviating
the usually tight constraints from CP-violation in Randall-Sundrum scenarios.
We study how the Yukawa couplings vary during the stabilisation of the
Randall-Sundrum geometry and can thus induce large CP-violation during the
electroweak phase transition. Using holography, we discuss the 4D
interpretation of this dynamical interplay between flavour and electroweak
symmetry breaking.

decades of the observational evidence that a non-vanishing, positive,
$\Lambda$-term could be the simplest phenomenological explanation for the
observed acceleration of the Universe. This mixed state of affairs already
shows that we do no currently understand the theoretical nature of $\Lambda$.
In particular, we are still facing the crucial question whether $\Lambda$ is
truly a fundamental constant or a mildly evolving dynamical variable. At this
point the matter should be settled once more empirically and, amazingly enough,
the wealth of observational data at our disposal can presently shed true light
on it. In this short review I summarize the situation of some of these studies.
It turns out that the $\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being the simplest,
may well not be the most favored one when we put it in hard-fought competition
with specific dynamical models of the vacuum energy. Recently it has been shown
that the overall fit to the cosmological observables
$SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB$ do favor the class of ""running"" vacuum models
(RVM's) -- in which $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$ is a function of the Hubble rate --
against the ""concordance"" $\Lambda$CDM model. The support is at an
unprecedented level of $\sim4\sigma$ and is backed up with Akaike and Bayesian
criteria leading to compelling evidence in favor of the RVM option and other
related dynamical vacuum models. I also address the implications of this
framework on the possible time evolution of the fundamental constants of
Nature.

  We conduct preliminary mathematical analysis of the wellposedness of

of the nine combinations of three different forms of FDEs that are closed by
three types of Neumann boundary conditions are well posed and the remaining

at least one type of Neumann boundary condition such that the corresponding

is ill posed. This fully demonstrates the subtlety of the study of FDE.

uniform measure on $n$-step SAWs starting from a fixed vertex. It is
conjectured that the mean square displacement of an $n$-step SAW is

in mathematical and scientific research for long.
  In this paper we show that on any locally finite Cayley graph of an infinite,
finitely-generated group with more than two ends, the number of SAWs whose
end-to-end distances are linear in lengths has the same exponential growth rate
as the number of all the SAWs. We also prove that for any infinite,

square displacement exponent $\nu=1$ on such graphs.

quasi-transitive graphs with more than one end, which make use of a variation

acceleration of the fast solar wind emanating from coronal holes. Nonlinear
interactions between the dominant ${\bf z}_{+}$ waves and minority ${\bf
z}_{-}$ waves have the potential to transfer wave energy either to smaller
perpendicular scales (""direct cascade"") or to larger scales (""inverse
cascade""). In this paper we use reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations
to investigate how the cascade rates $\epsilon_{\pm}$ depend on perpendicular
wavenumber and radial distance from Sun center. For models with a smooth
background atmosphere we find that an inverse cascade ($\epsilon_{+} < 0$)
occurs for the dominant waves at radii between 1.4 and 2.5 $R_\odot$ and
dimensionless wavenumbers in the inertial range ($15 < a_\perp < 44$), and a
direct cascade ($\epsilon_{+} > 0$) occurs elsewhere. For a model with density
fluctuations there are multiple regions with inverse cascade. In both cases the
cascade rate $\epsilon_{+}$ varies significantly with perpendicular wavenumber,
indicating that the cacsade is a highly non-local process. As a result of the
inverse cascades, the enery dissipation rates are much lower than expected from
a phenomenological model, and are insufficient to maintain the temperature of
the background atmosphere. We conclude that RMHD models are unable to reproduce
the observed properties of the fast solar wind.

prove analogous output bounds for disjunctive datalog rules, and answer several
open questions regarding the tightness and looseness of these bounds along the

then show how such a proof sequence can be interpreted as symbolic instructions
guiding an algorithm called ""PANDA"", which answers disjunctive datalog rules
within the time that the size bound predicted. We show that PANDA can be used
as a black-box to devise algorithms matching precisely the fractional hypertree
width and the submodular width runtimes for aggregate and conjunctive queries
with functional dependencies and degree constraints.
  Our results improve upon known results in three ways. First, our bounds and
algorithms are for the much more general class of disjunctive datalog rules, of
which conjunctive queries are a special case. Second, the runtime of PANDA
matches precisely the submodular width bound, while the previous algorithm by
Marx has a runtime that is polynomial in this bound. Third, our bounds and
algorithms work for queries with input cardinality bounds, functional
dependencies, and degree constraints.
  Overall, our results show a deep connection between three seemingly unrelated

emission from the $^{12}$CO J=2-1 line, H30$\alpha$ recombination line, and
continuum is imaged at a resolution of $\sim$8$""$, revealing the morphology of
the molecular environment around the star. The continuum emission is unresolved
and peaks at the position of the star. The radio recombination line H30$\alpha$
shows unresolved emission at the star, with an approximately gaussian spectrum
centered on a velocity of 21$\pm$3~km/s with a width of 57$\pm$6~km/s. In
contrast, the CO 2-1 emission is complex and decomposes into several components
beyond the contamination from interstellar gas in the line of sight. The CO
spectrum toward the star is a broad plateau, centered at the systemic velocity
of +18 km/s and with an expansion velocity of 100$\pm$10 km/s. Assuming
isotropic and constant mass-loss, we estimate a mass-loss rate of 8$\pm$1.5
$\times10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At a radius of 25$""$ from the star, we
detect CO emission associated with the dust ring previously imaged by {\it
Herschel}. The kinematics of this ring, however, is not consistent with an
expanding shell, but show a velocity gradient of $v_{sys} \pm$20 km/s. In
addition, we find a puzzling bright feature radially connecting the star to the
CO ring, at a velocity of +40 km/s relative to the star. This spur feature may
trace a unidirectional ejection event from the star. Our ACA observations
reveal the complex morphology around IRAS 17163 and illustrate the
breakthroughs that ALMA will bring to the field of massive stellar evolution.

Perhaps surprisingly, our positive results show that for a broad class of

predictions only on the most recent few observation together with a set of
simple summary statistics of the past observations. Specifically, we show that
for any distribution over observations, if the mutual information between past

Markov model over the most recent $I/\epsilon$ observations obtains expected KL
error $\epsilon$---and hence $\ell_1$ error $\sqrt{\epsilon}$---with respect to
the optimal predictor that has access to the entire past and knows the data
generating distribution. For a Hidden Markov Model with $n$ hidden states, $I$
is bounded by $\log n$, a quantity that does not depend on the mixing time, and

frequencies of length $O(\log n/\epsilon)$ windows of observations achieves
this error, provided the length of the sequence is $d^{\Omega(\log

  We also establish that this result cannot be improved upon, even for the

necessary to achieve expected $\ell_1$ error $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Second, the

this robust mechanism can generate black holes over the entire mass range

predict the performance of such structures and optimize the geometrical

is exploited to solve the electromagnetic scattering of plasmonic

large geometrical elements, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns
for a given problem. Compared to other well-known methods for EM modeling of
plasmonic nanostructures, the LCN is computationally efficient, straightforward
to implement and provides exponential convergence. A full comparison, in terms

makes two images similar? Most existing work on visual similarity assumes that
images are similar because they contain the same object instance or category.
However, the reason why images are similar is much more complex. For example,
from the perspective of category, a black dog image is similar to a white dog
image. However, in terms of color, a black dog image is more similar to a black
horse image than the white dog image. This example serves to illustrate that
visual similarity is ambiguous but can be made precise when given an explicit
contextual perspective. Based on this observation, we propose the concept of
contextual visual similarity. To be concrete, we examine the concept of
contextual visual similarity in the application domain of image search. Instead
of providing only a single image for image similarity search (\eg, Google image
search), we require three images. Given a query image, a second positive image
and a third negative image, dissimilar to the first two images, we define a
contextualized similarity search criteria. In particular, we learn feature
weights over all the feature dimensions of each image such that the distance
between the query image and the positive image is small and their distances to
the negative image are large after reweighting their features. The learned
feature weights encode the contextualized visual similarity specified by the
user and can be used for attribute specific image search. We also show the
usefulness of our contextualized similarity weighting scheme for different
tasks, such as answering visual analogy questions and unsupervised attribute

energy distribution (SED) of the star WOCS-5885, after combining with flux
measurements from GALEX, UIT, UVOT, SPITZER, WISE and several ground-based
facilities. The resulting SED spans a wavelength range of 0.15~${\mu}$m to
7.8~${\mu}$m. This object is found to be one of the brightest FUV sources in
the cluster. An analysis of the SED reveals the presence of two components. The
cooler component is found to have a temperature of 6,000$\pm$150~K, confirming
that it is a BSS. Assuming it to be a main-sequence star, we estimate its mass
to be $\sim$ 1.1 - 1.2M$_\odot$. The hotter component, with an estimated
temperature of 17,000$\pm$500~K, has a radius of $\sim$ 0.6R$_\odot$ and L
$\sim$ 30L$_\odot$. Bigger and more luminous than a white dwarf, yet cooler
than a sub-dwarf, we speculate that it is a post-AGB/HB star that has recently
transferred its mass to the BSS, which is known to be a rapid rotator. This
binary system, which is the first BSS with a post-AGB/HB companion identified
in an open cluster, is an ideal laboratory to study the process of BSS

retrieval. Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking
advantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently.
However, existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one
hand, a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to
the discrete Hamming distance, which raises a critical issue of image retrieval
where fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand, different
hash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently, and treating
them equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the
above two problems, we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH)
approach, which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by
weighted Hamming distance. First, a novel deep hashing network is proposed to
learn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly, so that the
learned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different
image classes. Second, a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed,
which rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing
its semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image
retrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance, which can provide
more accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance. Experiments on
four widely used datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms eight
state-of-the-art hashing methods.

can estimate the parameter without access to the data. However, the memory or
code size for storing the sufficient statistic may nonetheless still be
prohibitive. Indeed, for $n$ independent samples drawn from a $k$-nomial
distribution with $d=k-1$ degrees of freedom, the length of the code scales as
$d\log n+O(1)$. In many applications, we may not have a useful notion of
sufficient statistics (e.g., when the parametric family is not an exponential
family) and we also may not need to reconstruct the generating distribution
exactly. By adopting a Shannon-theoretic approach in which we allow a small
error in estimating the generating distribution, we construct various {\em
approximate sufficient statistics} and show that the code length can be reduced
to $\frac{d}{2}\log n+O(1)$. We consider errors measured according to the
relative entropy and variational distance criteria. For the code constructions,
we leverage Rissanen's minimum description length principle, which yields a
non-vanishing error measured according to the relative entropy. For the
converse parts, we use Clarke and Barron's formula for the relative entropy of
a parametrized distribution and the corresponding mixture distribution.
However, this method only yields a weak converse for the variational distance.
We develop new techniques to achieve vanishing errors and we also prove strong
converses. The latter means that even if the code is allowed to have a
non-vanishing error, its length must still be at least $\frac{d}{2}\log n$.

contributed by hard hadrons ($p_T > 8.0$~GeV/$c$) in both peripheral and
central PbPb collisions, while the opposite direction in central collisions is
dominated by soft hadrons ($p_T = 0.5$-$2.0$~GeV/$c$). The study of in-cone and
out-of-cone contributions to $\langle \slashed{p}_{T}^{||} \rangle$ shows that
these soft hadrons are mostly emitted at large angles away from the dijet axis.
Our AMPT calculation is in qualitative agreement with the CMS measurements and
the primary mechanism for the energy transported to large angles in the AMPT
model is the elastic scattering at the partonic stage. Future studies including
also inelastic processes should be helpful in understanding the overestimation
of the magnitudes of in-cone and out-of-cone imbalances from our AMPT
calculations, and shed light on different roles played by radiative and
collisional processes in the redistribution of the lost energy from hard jets.

contributions, most notably at 22GHz, using advanced phase referencing
techniques. Nevertheless to increase the capability for high precision
astrometric measurements at low radio frequencies (<8GHz) an effective
calibration strategy of the systematic ionospheric propagation effects that is
widely applicable is required. Observations at low frequencies are dominated by
distinct direction dependent ionospheric propagation errors, which place a very
tight limit on the angular separation of a suitable phase referencing
calibrator.
  The MultiView technique holds the key to the compensation of atmospheric
spatial-structure errors, by using observations of multiple calibrators and 2-D
interpolation. In this paper we present the first demonstration of the power of
MultiView using three calibrators, several degrees from the target, along with
a comparative study of the astrometric accuracy between MultiView and
phase-referencing techniques.
  MultiView calibration provides an order of magnitude improvement in
astrometry with respect to conventional phase referencing, achieving ca. 100
micro-arcseconds astrometry errors in a single epoch of observations,
effectively reaching the thermal noise limit.
  MultiView will achieve its full potential with the enhanced sensitivity and
multibeam capabilities of SKA and the pathfinders, which will enable
simultaneous observations of the target and calibrators. Our demonstration

with a viscoelastic body made of Maxwell material. Our approach remains regular
for any spin rate and orientation, and for any orbital configuration including
high eccentricities and close encounters. The method is to integrate
simultaneously the rotation and the position of the planet as well as its
deformation. We provide the equations of motion both in the body frame and in
the inertial frame. With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the
spatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from
quantum theory. We also provide the vectorial expression of the secular tidal
torque expanded in Fourier series. Applying this model to close-in exoplanets,
we observe that if the relaxation time is longer than the revolution period,
the phase space of the system is characterized by the presence of several
spin-orbit resonances, even in the circular case. As the system evolves, the
planet spin can visit different spin-orbit configurations. The obliquity is
decreasing along most of these resonances, but we observe a case where the
planet tilt is instead growing. These conclusions derived from the secular
torque are successfully tested with numerical integrations of the instantaneous
equations of motion on HD 80606b. Our formalism is also well adapted to
close-in super-Earths in multiplanet systems which are known to have non-zero
mutual inclinations.

attributed-guided augmentation (AGA) which learns a mapping that allows to

to a large external corpus of heavily annotated samples. While prior works
primarily augment in the space of images, we propose to perform augmentation in

demonstrate the utility of our approach on the problems of (1) one-shot object
recognition in a transfer-learning setting where we have no prior knowledge of
the new classes, as well as (2) object-based one-shot scene recognition. As

positioning of the cavities and radio bubbles. The radio lobes and X-ray
cavities are apparently not spatially coincident and exhibit offsets by ~61 kpc

Radial temperature and density profiles reveal the presence of a cool core in

amount of matter from the core of the cluster by the radio jets. A detailed
analysis of the temperature and density profiles showed the presence of a
rarely detected elliptical shock in the cluster. Detection of inflating

central engine feeds a remarkable amount of radio power (~6.3 X 10^44 erg/s)

cooling luminosity of the cluster was estimated to be ~8.30 X 10^43 erg/s,

patients maximize community participation and living independence. To further
improve the precision and efficiency of rehabilitative therapy, more objective
methods need to be developed based on sensory data. In this paper, an
algorithmic framework is proposed to provide classification of gait disorders
caused by two common neurological diseases, stroke and Parkinson's Disease
(PD), from ground contact force (GCF) data. An advanced machine learning
method, multi-task feature learning (MTFL), is used to jointly train
classification models of a subject's gait in three classes, post-stroke, PD and
healthy gait. Gait parameters related to mobility, balance, strength and rhythm
are used as features for the classification. Out of all the features used, the
MTFL models capture the more important ones per disease, which will help
provide better objective assessment and therapy progress tracking. To evaluate
the proposed methodology we use data from a human participant study, which
includes five PD patients, three post-stroke patients, and three healthy
subjects. Despite the diversity of abnormalities, the evaluation shows that the
proposed approach can successfully distinguish post-stroke and PD gait from
healthy gait, as well as post-stroke from PD gait, with Area Under the Curve

gait features to better understand the key characteristics that distinguish

feedback between the embedded system and its environment. These three
formulations: it density functional embedding, Green's function embedding, and
density matrix embedding, respectively use the single-particle density,
single-particle Green's function, and single-particle density matrix as the
quantum variables of interest. Many excellent reviews exist covering these
methods individually. However, a unified presentation of the different
formalisms is so far lacking. Indeed, the various languages commonly used:
functional equations for density functional embedding; diagrammatics for
Green's function embedding; and entanglement arguments for density matrix
embedding, make the three formulations appear vastly different. In this
account, we introduce the basic equations of all three formulations in such a
way as to highlight their many common intellectual strands. While we focus
primarily on a straightforward theoretical perspective, we also give a brief
overview of recent applications, and possible future developments.

at least two of the jets are tagged as $b$-quark jets. The fitted fractions of
longitudinal, left- and right-handed polarisation states are $F_{\mathrm{0}}=

phenomena. The temporal dynamics and the probability density function of the
oscillation amplitude are described by a Langevin equation and its associated
Fokker-Planck equation, respectively. One method consists in fitting the
postulated analytical drift and diffusion coefficients with their estimated
values, obtained from data processing by taking the short-time limit of the
first two transition moments. However, this limit estimation loses robustness
in some situations - for instance when the data is band-pass filtered to
isolate the spectral contents of the oscillatory phenomena of interest. In this
paper, we use a robust alternative where the adjoint Fokker-Planck equation is
solved to compute Kramers-Moyal coefficients exactly, and an iterative
optimisation yields the parameters that best fit the observed statistics
simultaneously in a wide range of amplitudes and time scales. The method is
illustrated with a stochastic Van der Pol oscillator serving as a prototypical
model of thermoacoustic instabilities in practical combustors, where system
identification is highly relevant to control.

  Heterogeneous Motion Blur",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Removing pixel-wise heterogeneous motion blur is challenging due to the
ill-posed nature of the problem. The predominant solution is to estimate the
blur kernel by adding a prior, but the extensive literature on the subject
indicates the difficulty in identifying a prior which is suitably informative,
and general. Rather than imposing a prior based on theory, we propose instead
to learn one from the data. Learning a prior over the latent image would
require modeling all possible image content. The critical observation
underpinning our approach is thus that learning the motion flow instead allows
the model to focus on the cause of the blur, irrespective of the image content.
This is a much easier learning task, but it also avoids the iterative process
through which latent image priors are typically applied. Our approach directly
estimates the motion flow from the blurred image through a fully-convolutional
deep neural network (FCN) and recovers the unblurred image from the estimated
motion flow. Our FCN is the first universal end-to-end mapping from the blurred
image to the dense motion flow. To train the FCN, we simulate motion flows to
generate synthetic blurred-image-motion-flow pairs thus avoiding the need for
human labeling. Extensive experiments on challenging realistic blurred images
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

dynamic nuclear polarization effects on electronic transport and in turn the
electron-spin polarization effects on the nuclear spin dynamics. In particular,
we show that the hysteresis noted experimentally in the conductance-voltage
trace as well as in the resistively detected NMR lineshape results from a lack
of quasi-equilibrium between electronic transport and nuclear polarization
evolution. In addition, we present circuit models to emulate such hyperfine
mediated transport effects to further facilitate a clear understanding of the

hence the star formation history. For NGC 185 we found that the main epoch of
star formation occurred 8.3 Gyr ago, followed by a much lower, but relatively
constant star formation rate. In the case of NGC 147, the star formation rate
peaked only 7 Gyr ago, staying intense until ~ 3 Gyr ago, but no star formation

that the electron-hole attraction rules x-ray absorption for deep core states,

introduced by the exchange interaction between the excited electron and the

the context of web-caching and content delivery network previously, the
conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to ICN due to the fine

within the category of complex systems. They can be described

constitute the grounds for output-only model-based system identification. It
has been shown recently that one can extract the governing parameters of the
instabilities, namely the linear growth rate and the nonlinear component of the
thermoacoustic feedback, using dynamic pressure time series only. This is
highly relevant for practical systems, which cannot be actively controlled due
to a lack of cost-effective actuators. The thermoacoustic stability is given by
the linear growth rate, which results from the combination of the acoustic
damping and the coherent feedback from the flame. In this paper, it is shown
that it is possible to quantify the acoustic damping of the system, and thus to
separate its contribution to the linear growth rate from the one of the flame.
This is achieved by post-processing in a simple way simultaneously acquired
chemiluminescence and acoustic pressure data. It provides an additional
approach to further unravel from observed time series the key mechanisms
governing the system dynamics. This straightforward method is illustrated here
using experimental data from a combustion chamber operated at several linearly

spin-changing forward scattering are captured by a mean-field description and
scale linearly with density regardless of the dimension of the system.
Conversely, ""incoherent"" collision processes which e.g. lead to the damping of
spin oscillations, behave differently. In the usual three-dimensional (3D)
case, the rate of incoherent processes increases faster with density than
mean-field effects, but in 1D it increases slower. This means, that in the 1D
case, incoherent collisions become more important at lower densities. We study
these effects by deriving and integrating a quantum Boltzmann equation. We
demonstrate that the well known fact that in one dimension, interaction-induced
correlations become more dominant at low densities can be observed in
far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics.

sufficiently large. As a consequence, Glauber dynamics is stable to small,

by the statistical ensemble of domain wall networks which represents the almost
everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon field configurations.
Calculations of the form factors are performed consistently with mass spectra
of light, heavy-light and double-heavy mesons, their weak and strong decay
constants. Influence of the nonperturbative intermediate range gluon fields on
asymptotic behaviour of pion transition form factor is of particular interest,
as it can potentially lead to the growth of $Q^2F_{\pi\gamma^*\gamma}(Q^2)$. It
is found that $Q^2F_{\pi\gamma^*\gamma}(Q^2)$ approaches a constant value at
asymptotically large $Q^2$. However, this limit differs from the standard
factorization bound, though for pion form factor complies with Belle data more
likely than with BaBar ones. At the same time the generally accepted
factorization bound is shown to be satisfied for the case of the symmetric
kinematics, $Q^2F_{P\gamma^*\gamma^*}(Q^2)$. Peculiarities of description of

the rotational light curve and in the absolute magnitude. This suggests that
the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight has changed
noticeably during the last 16 years as Bienor orbits the Sun. From the light
curve amplitude data we are able to determine the orientation of the rotation
axis of Bienor ($\beta_p=50\pm3^{\circ}$, $\lambda_p=35\pm8^{\circ}$). We are
also able to constrain the $b/a$ axial ratio of a triaxial Jacobi ellipsoidal
body (with semi-axis $a>b>c$). The best fit is for $b/a=0.45\pm0.05$, which
corresponds to a density value of $594^{+47}_{-35}$ kg$\,$m$^{-3}$ under the
usual assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and given that Bienor's rotational
period is 9.17 h. However, the absolute magnitude of Bienor at several epochs
is not well reproduced. We tested several explanations such as relaxing the
hydrostatic equilibrium constraint, a large North-South asymmetry in the
surface albedo of Bienor or even a ring system. When a ring system of similar
characteristics to those of Chariklo and Chiron is included, we can fit both
the light curve amplitude and absolute magnitude. In this case the derived
axial ratio is modified to $b/a=0.37\pm0.10$. The implied density is
$678^{+209}_{-100}$ kg$\,$m$^{-3}$. Also the existence of a ring is consistent
with the spectroscopic detection of water ice on Bienor. Nevertheless the other

properties and residual stress has been studies thoroughly. Refractive index
estimated from ellipsometric measurement and suitable modeling depicts an
interesting decreasing behavior with substrate rotation and has been explained
in the light of varying columnar structure with substrate rotation. Refractive
index of GLAD ZrO2 films varies between and 1.901 to 2.011. Normally deposited
film exhibits refractive index value of 2.178 which is substantially greater
than that of GLAD films. Lowering in refractive index of glancing angle
deposited films is the attribute of dominant atomic shadowing at glancing
angles. Further, correlation length which is the representative of surface
grain size was obtained from suitable modeling of atomic force microscopy data
and it exhibits a decreasing trend with substrate rotation. The trend has also
been attributed to the varying columnar microstructure with substrate rotation.
All the glancing angle deposited ZrO2 films possess root mean square roughness
between 4.6 and 5.1 nm whereas normally deposited film depicts 1.0 nm rms
roughness. Dominant atomic shadowing is responsible for high roughness of GLAD
films. Both glancing angle and normally deposited films exhibit preferential
growth of monoclinic phase oriented in different directions. GLAD films also
depict a tetragonal peak which has been attributed to the fine nano-crystallite
size (~13 nm). Residual stress depicts a great switching from large compressive
to small tensile as the deposition angle switches from normal to glancing angle

that uses our algorithms. Heavy hitter detection in streams is a fundamental
problem with many applications, including detecting certain DDoS attacks and
anomalies. A (classic) heavy hitter (HH) in a stream of elements is a key
(e.g., the domain of a query) which appears in many elements (e.g., requests).
When stream elements consist of a <key; subkey> pairs, (<domain; subdomain>) a
distinct heavy hitter (dhh) is a key that is paired with a large number of
different subkeys. Our dHH algorithms are considerably more practical than
previous algorithms. Specifically the new fixed-size algorithms are simple to
code and with asymptotically optimal space accuracy tradeoffs. In addition we
introduce a new measure, a combined heavy hitter (cHH), which is a key with a
large combination of distinct and classic weights. Efficient algorithms are
also presented for cHH detection. Finally, we perform extensive experimental
evaluation on real DNS attack traces, demonstrating the effectiveness of both
our algorithms and our DNS malicious queries identification system.

dimension $4$. Here, $j$ can be a positive integer, which corresponds to a
boson; $j$ can also be a positive half-integer, which corresponds to a fermion.
In this paper, we introduce regularly decomposable tensors and show that a
spin-$j$ state is classical if and only if its representing tensor is a
regularly decomposable tensor. In the even-order case, a regularly decomposable
tensor is a completely decomposable tensor but not vice versa; a completely
decomposable tensors is a sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor but not vice versa; an
SOS tensor is a positive semi-definite (PSD) tensor but not vice versa. In the
odd-order case, the first row tensor of a regularly decomposable tensor is
regularly decomposable and its other row tensors are induced by the regular
decomposition of its first row tensor. We also show that complete
decomposability and regular decomposability are invariant under orthogonal
transformations, and that the completely decomposable tensor cone and the
regularly decomposable tensor cone are closed convex cones. Furthermore, in the
even-order case, the completely decomposable tensor cone and the PSD tensor
cone are dual to each other. The Hadamard product of two completely
decomposable tensors is still a completely decomposable tensor. Since one may
apply the positive semi-definite programming algorithm to detect whether a
symmetric tensor is an SOS tensor or not, this gives a checkable necessary
condition for classicality of a spin-$j$ state. Further research issues on
regularly decomposable tensors are also raised.

basis ${\cal L}_\ell(\hat{k} \cdot \hat{n})$ but the bipolar spherical harmonic
one $\{Y_{\ell}(\hat{k}) \otimes Y_{\ell'}(\hat{n})\}_{LM}$, the
symmetry-breaking signal can be completely distinguished from the usual
isotropic one since the former yields nonvanishing $L \geq 1$ modes but the
latter is confined to the $L = 0$ one. As a demonstration, we analyze the
signatures due to primordial-origin symmetry breakings such as the well-known
quadrupolar-type and dipolar-type power asymmetries and find nonzero $L = 2$

indicate that the $Planck$-level sensitivity could be achieved by the SDSS or

algorithm of Moser & Tardos only works in the setting of independent variables,
and does not apply in this context. We resolve this by developing a randomized
polynomial-time algorithm for such applications. A noteworthy application is
for Latin transversals: the best-known general result here (Bissacot et al.,
improving on Erd\H{o}s and Spencer), states that any $n \times n$ matrix in
which each entry appears at most $(27/256)n$ times, has a Latin transversal. We
present the first polynomial-time algorithm to construct such a transversal. We
also develop RNC algorithms for Latin transversals, rainbow Hamiltonian cycles,
strong chromatic number, and hypergraph packing.
  In addition to efficiently finding a configuration which avoids bad-events,
the algorithm of Moser & Tardos has many powerful extensions and properties.
These include a well-characterized distribution on the output distribution,
parallel algorithms, and a partial resampling variant. We show that our
algorithm has nearly all of the same useful properties as the Moser-Tardos
algorithm, and present a comparison of this aspect with recent works on the LLL
in general probability spaces.

star belongs to the group of weak G-band stars that present very strong carbon

  We use spectropolarimetric data, which allows the simultaneous measurement of
the longitudinal magnetic field $B_{l}$, line activity indicators (H$\alpha$,
Ca\,{\sc ii} IRT, S-index) and radial velocity of the star, and consequently
perform a direct comparison of their time variability. Mean Stokes V profiles

the surface magnetic field of the star is reconstructed via the Zeeman Doppler

  A periodogram analysis is performed on our dataset and it reveals a rotation
period of 111 days. We interpret this period to be the rotation period of 37
Com. The reconstructed magnetic map reveals that the structure of the surface
magnetic field is complex and features a significant toroidal component. The
time variability of the line activity indicators, radial velocity and magnetic
field $B_{l}$ indicates a possible evolution of the surface magnetic structures
in the period from 2008 to 2011. For completeness of our study, we use
customized stellar evolutionary models suited to a weak G-band star. Synthetic

  We deduce that 37 Com is a 6.5~$M_{\odot}$ weak G-band star located in the

regular peaks in the light curves during the flare emissions. Sometimes, QPPs
show multiple periods at the same wavelength. However, changing periods in
various channels are rare. Aims. We report QPPs in a solar flare on 2014
October 27. They showed a period change that depended on whether thermal or
nonthermal components were included. The flare was simultaneously observed by
many instruments. Methods. Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), we
decomposed the light curves at multiple wavelengths into slowly varying and
rapidly varying signals. Then we identified the QPPs as the regular and
periodic peaks from the rapidly varying signals. The periods are derived with
the wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly
varying signals. Results. We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions
during the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At
the same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal
emissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is
exactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection
rate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our
results further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength,
such as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the
periodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. Conclusions. To our knowledge,
this is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal
components in a single flare that occur at almost the same time. This new
observational finding could be a challenge to the theory of flare QPPs.

the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical,

online group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills.
  Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized
exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period
of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a
tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group
(individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post-
measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social
wellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET
Ethics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N.
2014-001).
  Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in
terms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group
fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case
for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For
psychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both
groups, regardless of the application used.
  Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating
and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter
individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together
despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise
can reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. Longer term
interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts
on wellbeing.

We employ two tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states as
the quantum channel linking the parties. We find the success probability to be
$1/4$. However, this probability can be ameliorated to $3/4$ if the state
preparers assist by transmitting individual partial information through

investigate the effects of five quantum noises: the bit-flip noise, bit-phase
flip noise, amplitude-damping noise, phase-damping noise and depolarizing noise
on the JRSP process. We obtain the analytical derivation of the fidelities
corresponding to each quantum noisy channel, which is a measure of information
loss as the qubits are being distributed in these quantum channels. We find
that the system loses some of its properties as a consequence of unwanted
interactions with environment. For instance, within the domain
$0<\lambda<0.65$, the information lost via transmission of qubits in amplitude

$K$-prescription, our n-body simulations adopt the damping formulae for
eccentricity and inclination provided by the hydrodynamical simulations of our
companion paper. We follow the evolution of $11000$ numerical experiments of
three giant planets in the late stage of the gas disc, exploring different
initial configurations, planetary mass ratios and disc masses. The dynamical
evolutions of the planetary systems are studied along the simulations, with
emphasis on the resonance captures and inclination-growth mechanisms. Most of
the systems are found with small inclinations ($\le10^{\circ}$) at the
dispersal of the disc. Even though many systems enter an inclination-type
resonance during the migration, the disc usually damps the inclinations on a
short timescale. Although the majority of the multiple systems in our results
are quasi-coplanar, $\sim5\%$ of them end up with high mutual inclinations
($\ge10^{\circ}$). Half of these highly mutually inclined systems result from
two- or three-body MMR captures, the other half being produced by orbital
instability and/or planet-planet scattering. When considering the long-term
evolution over $100$ Myr, destabilization of the resonant systems is common,
and the percentage of highly mutually inclined systems still evolving in
resonance drops to $30\%$. Finally, the parameters of the final system
configurations are in very good agreement with the semi-major axis and
eccentricity distributions in the observations, showing that planet-planet
interactions during the disc phase could have played an important role in

amplification of the probe pulse power together and adequately small probe
pulse distortion. We then show that the use of pulse mode EDFA is a
cost-effective solution, which allows one to avoid nonlinear effect and ensure
sufficient sensitivity of the setup.

Dietrich and Adrian Koenigstein","Schwinger's proper time and worldline holographic renormalisation","12 pages",,,,"hep-th hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Worldline holography states that within the framework of the worldline
approach to quantum field theory, sources of a quantum field theory over
Mink$_4$ naturally form a field theory over AdS$_5$ {\sl to all orders} in the
elementary fields and in the sources of arbitrary spin. (Such correspondences
are also available for other pairs of spacetimes, not only
Mink$_4\leftrightarrow\mathrm{AdS}_5$.) Schwinger's proper time of the
worldline formalism is automatically grouped with the physical four spacetime
dimensions into an AdS$_5$ geometry. We show that the worldline holographic
effective action in general and the proper-time profiles of the sources in
particular solve a renormalisation group equation and, reversely, can be
defined as solution to the latter. This fact also ensures regulator
independence.

models with many layers of latent variables. We include deterministic paths
between all latent variables and the generated output, and provide a richer set
of connections between computations for inference and generation, which enables
more effective communication of information throughout the model during
training. To improve performance on natural images, we incorporate a
lightweight autoregressive model in the reconstruction distribution. These
techniques permit end-to-end training of models with 10+ layers of latent
variables. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on standard image modelling benchmarks, can expose latent class
structure in the absence of label information, and can provide convincing
imputations of occluded regions in natural images.

solve and it is of major relevance in pattern recognition. In the recent years,
many methods and algorithms have been proposed; still, a definitive solution is
far from being found. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on fuzzy
logic. The proposed method combines in a novel way three features for
segmenting touching characters that have been already proposed in other studies
but have been exploited only singularly so far. The proposed strategy is based
on a 3--input/1--output fuzzy inference system with fuzzy rules specifically
optimized for segmenting touching characters in the case of Latin printed and
handwritten characters. The system performances are illustrated and supported
by numerical examples showing that our approach can achieve a reasonable good
overall accuracy in segmenting characters even on tricky conditions of touching
characters. Moreover, numerical results suggest that the method can be applied
to many different datasets of characters by means of a convenient tuning of the
fuzzy sets and rules.

However, when treating harmonic oscillators the effect of sliding friction is
often neglected. Here, we propose a simple analytical model to include both
viscous and sliding fiction in common harmonic oscillator equations, allowing
to separate these different types of dissipation. To compare this model with
experimental data, a nanometric vibration was imposed on a quartz tuning fork,
while an atomic force microscope tip was used to disturb its motion. We
analyzed tuning fork resonance curves and `ring down' experiments and for each
case calculated the amount of sliding friction and of viscous damping, finding
an agreement between the two different experiments and the model proposed.

system and provide several results. We derive the Radon-Nikodym derivative
(with respect to Lebesgue measure) of the measure that describes the average
distribution of customer priority levels in the system; we provide a formula
for the expected sojourn time of a customer as a function of his priority
level; and we provide a formula for the expected waiting time of a customer as
a function of his priority level. We verify our theoretical analysis with
discrete-event simulations. We discuss how each of our results generalizes
previous work on infinite dimensional models for single server priority queues.

from a point of view of a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon-Fock equations. It is
shown that the Nahm reduction does not work, another choice is proposed and

Feynmann-Maslov path integral construction and its zeta function representation
in terms of a Green function diagonal for an auxiliary heat equation with an
elliptic potential. The natural renormalization use a freedom in vacuum state
choice as well as the choice of the norm of an evolution operator eigenvectors.
A nonzero mass appears via the quasiclassical correction.
