be excited when the Compton wavelength of the field equals a dynamical scale in
the problem. For binaries composed of a star orbiting a supermassive black
hole, these resonances lead to a smoking-gun effect: a periastron distance
which {\it stalls}, even in the presence of gravitational-wave dissipation.
This effect, also called a {\it floating orbit}, occurs for generic equatorial
but eccentric orbits and we argue that finite-size effects are not enough to
suppress it.

to match image patches for stereo reconstruction. However, training such
metrics requires large amount of labeled stereo images, which can be difficult
or costly to collect for certain applications. The main contribution of our
work is a new semi-supervised method for learning deep metrics from unlabeled
stereo images, given coarse information about the scenes and the optical
system. Our method alternatively optimizes the metric with a standard
stochastic gradient descent, and applies stereo constraints to regularize its
prediction. Experiments on reference data-sets show that, for a given network
architecture, training with this new method without ground-truth produces a
metric with performance as good as state-of-the-art baselines trained with the
said ground-truth. This work has three practical implications. Firstly, it
helps to overcome limitations of training sets, in particular noisy ground
truth. Secondly it allows to use much more training data during learning.
Thirdly, it allows to tune deep metric for a particular stereo system, even if
ground truth is not available.

those objects are often endowed with some kind of features. How does the
presence or absence of such features interplay with the network link structure?
Although the situation here described is truly ubiquitous, there is a limited
body of research dealing with large graphs of this kind. Many previous works
considered homophily as the only possible transmission mechanism translating
node features into links. Other authors, instead, developed more sophisticated
models, that are able to handle complex feature interactions, but are unfit to
scale to very large networks. We expand on the MGJ model, where interactions
between pairs of features can foster or discourage link formation. In this
work, we will investigate how to estimate the latent feature-feature
interactions in this model. We shall propose two solutions: the first one
assumes feature independence and it is essentially based on Naive Bayes; the
second one, which relaxes the independence assumption assumption, is based on
perceptrons. In fact, we show it is possible to cast the model equation in
order to see it as the prediction rule of a perceptron. We analyze how
classical results for the perceptrons can be interpreted in this context; then,
we define a fast and simple perceptron-like algorithm for this task, which can
process $10^8$ links in minutes. We then compare these two techniques, first
with synthetic datasets that follows our model, gaining evidence that the Naive
independence assumptions are detrimental in practice. Secondly, we consider a
real, large-scale citation network where each node (i.e., paper) can be
described by different types of characteristics; there, our algorithm can
assess how well each set of features can explain the links, and thus finding
meaningful latent feature-feature interactions.

first-principles calculations, we discover that gray tin becomes a Dirac
semimetal under tensile uniaxial strain, in contrast to a topological insulator
under compressive uniaxial strain as known before. In this newly found Dirac
semimetal state, two Dirac points which are tunable by tensile [001] strains,
lie in the $k_z$ axis and Fermi arcs appear in the (100) surface. Duo the low
carrier concentration and high mobility of gray tin, a large chiral anomaly
induced negative magnetoresistance and a strong SdH oscillation are anticipated
in this half of strain spectrum. Comparing to other Dirac semimetals, the
proposed Dirac semimetal state in the nontoxic elemental gray tin can be more
easily manipulated and accurately controlled. We envision that gray tin
provides a perfect platform for strain engineering of chiral magnetic effects

versa.

function of the chain length $N$ and the temperature difference $\Delta T$

500$ K), the chains, with $N > 18$ atoms, present a diffusive transport regime
with the presence of a temperature gradient across the system. For lower

ballistic-like regime is also obtained for shorter chains ($N \le 15 $). Our
detailed analysis suggests that the behaviour at higher temperatures and

construct ensembles. The first one is based on the fact that in the minimax
game which is played to optimize the GAN objective the generator network keeps
on changing even after the network can be considered optimal. As such ensembles
of GANs can be constructed based on the same network initialization but just
taking models which have different amount of iterations. These so-called self
ensembles are much faster to train than traditional ensembles. The second
method, called cascade GANs, redirects part of the training data which is badly
modeled by the first GAN to another GAN. In experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset

better model the data distribution. In addition, we show that these improved

controlled passivation of the edges of subnanometer pores and subsequent doping

into a Higgs boson and a top quark is performed using data from pp collisions
at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the
CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns.
The top quark decay includes an electron or a muon while the Higgs boson decays
into a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds
is observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the production cross section
and the branching fraction are derived in the T quark mass range 700 to 1800
GeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, values of the product of the production cross
section and the branching fraction greater than 0.8 and 0.7 pb are excluded at
95% confidence level, assuming left- and right-handed coupling of the T quark
to standard model particles, respectively. This is the first analysis setting
exclusion limits on the cross section of singly produced vector-like T quarks
at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

a circularly polarized field breaks the equivalence of valleys in different

as sets of resonance frequencies, that emerge in ensembles of fully branched

not determined by the cluster topology, but has rather the number-theoretic

processes on complex networks. In real societies, it is expected that these two
processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the
effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most
studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter
model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for
disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of
connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on
two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction $q$ of links present in both
networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both, the
opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion
dynamics has striking consequences on the properties of disease spreading. The
most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an
endemic phase observed in the contact process, becomes abrupt (discontinuous)
in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics
on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of
the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when
the coupling $q$ overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the
disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that
varies non-monotonically with $q$ in a large range of the model's parameters. A
mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease
can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled
from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and
disease transmission.

serve as `truth-values'. As usual with powerdomains, everything comes in three
flavours: lower, upper, and order-convex. The powerdomains are suitable convex
sets of subprobability valuations, corresponding to resolving nondeterministic
choice before probabilistic choice. Algebraically this corresponds to the
probabilistic choice operator distributing over the nondeterministic choice
operator. (An alternative approach to combining the two forms of nondeterminism
would be to resolve probabilistic choice first, arriving at a domain-theoretic
version of random sets. However, as we also show, the algebraic approach then
runs into difficulties.)
  Rather than working directly with valuations, we take a domain-theoretic
functional-analytic approach, employing domain-theoretic abstract convex sets
called Kegelspitzen; these are equivalent to the abstract probabilistic
algebras of Graham and Jones, but are more convenient to work with. So we
define power Kegelspitzen, and consider free algebras, functional
representations, and predicate transformers. To do so we make use of previous
work on domain-theoretic cones (d-cones), with the bridge between the two of

only to improve the visual quality, but for its impact on other post-processing
algorithms like image registration or segmentation. Many presented
state-of-the-art denoising methods are based on the self-similarity or
patch-based image processing. Specifically, Non-Local Means (NLM) as a
patch-based filter has gained increasing attention in recent years.
Essentially, this filter tends to obtain the noise-less signal value by
computing the Gaussian-weighted Euclidean distance between the patch
under-processing and other patches inside the image. However, the NLM filter is
sensitive to the outliers (pixels that their intensity values are far away from
other pixels) inside the patch, meaning that the pixels with the symmetric
locations in the patch are assigned the same weight. This can lead to
sub-optimal denoising performance when the destructive nature of noise
generates some outliers inside patches. In this paper, we propose a new
weighting approach to modify the Gaussian kernel of the NLM filter. Our
approach employs the geometric distance between image intensities to come up
with new weights for each pixel of a patch, lowering the impact of outliers on
the denoising performance. Experiments on a set of standard images and
different noise levels show that our proposed method outperforms the other
compared denoising filters.

at least in theory, to produce logical qubits with significantly lower error
rates than the underlying physical qubits. Suppose, however, that the gates
that act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate.
This can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set
of Clifford and $T$ gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of
gates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate
can add coherently so that, roughly, the error $\epsilon$ in the unitary of
each gate must scale as $\epsilon \lesssim 1/N$, where $N$ is the number of
gates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries
near the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the
target, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be
made to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly,
one needs $\epsilon \lesssim 1/\sqrt{N}$. We remark on one particular
application to distilling magic states where this effect happens automatically

Current statistical methods for analyzing these fibers reduce the rich

the rich functional data on the shape, size and orientation of fibers,
developing flexible models for characterizing the population distribution of
fibers between brain regions of interest within and across different

a corresponding rotation matrix, shape and translation from a global reference

of different Euclidean spaces and manifolds. To non-parametrically model the
distribution within and across individuals, we rely on a hierarchical mixture

population synthesis models to galaxy photometry or spectra. The state of the
art method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total
stellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods
yield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work
we improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the
resolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an
apparent filamentary mass distribution, and a spatial coincidence between mass
structures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on
iterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named
Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP). We have applied BSP to M 51, and to a pilot
sample of 90 spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral
Galaxy Survey. By comparing quantitatively both methods, we find that the
average fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half than
previously thought. In contrast with the previous method, the output BSP
mass-maps bear a better resemblance to near infrared images.

find the EAGLE galaxy population to perform significantly better on both

  When $W$ is a duality (or well-generated) group, we give an explicit

coefficients are not just polynomials, but differential forms with polynomial
coefficients.
  For every complex reflection group $W$, we show that the space of invariant
differential derivations is finitely generated as a module over the invariant
differential forms by the basic derivations together with their exterior
derivatives. When $W$ is a duality group, we show that the space of invariant
differential derivations is free as a module over the exterior subalgebra of

functions consisting of smooth regions separated by $C^2$ discontinuity curves,
is a well-established model for image data. The quest for optimal approximation
of this class has among others led to the development of curvelets,
contourlets, and shearlets. Due to parabolic scaling, these systems are able to
provide a quasi-optimal $N$-term approximation rate of order $N^{-2}$.
Replacing parabolic scaling by $\alpha$-scaling, one obtains $\alpha$-curvelets
and $\alpha$-shearlets, which interpolate between wavelet-type systems
($\alpha=1$), parabolically scaled systems ($\alpha=\frac12$), and
ridgelet-type systems ($\alpha=0$). Previous research shows that in the range
$\alpha\in[\frac{1}{2},1)$ they provide quasi-optimal approximation for
cartoons of regularity $C^{1/\alpha}$ with a rate of order $N^{-1/\alpha}$.
  In this work we continue to explore $\alpha$-scaled representation systems,
with the aim to better understand the role of the parameter $\alpha$ for
approximation. Concerning $\alpha$-curvelets with $\alpha<1$, we prove that the
best possible $N$-term approximation rate achievable for cartoons with curved
edges is limited to at most $N^{-1/(1-\alpha)}$, independent of the smoothness
of the cartoons. The maximal rate achievable by simple thresholding of the
frame coefficients is even bounded by $N^{-1/\max\{\alpha,1-\alpha\}}$. If the
edges of the cartoons are straight the approximation performance of
$\alpha$-curvelets is different: Assuming $C^\beta$ regularity, we establish an
approximation rate of order $N^{-\min\{\alpha^{-1},\beta\}}$, which is
quasi-optimal if $\alpha\in [0,\beta^{-1}]$. Finally, via the framework of
$\alpha$-molecules, the obtained results are extended to other $\alpha$-scaled
systems including in particular $\alpha$-shearlets.

which we show to be the main reason for the superior properties of black TiO2.
This work not only achieves an unprecedented understanding of black TiO2, but
also provides a new perspective for investigating carrier generation and
transport behavior at oxide interfaces, which are of tremendous fundamental and

entity (products) that may potentially work together with the reviewed product.
Knowing complementary entities of the reviewed product is very important
because customers want to buy compatible products and avoid incompatible ones.
In this paper, we address the problem of Complementary Entity Recognition
(CER). Since no existing method can solve this problem, we first propose a
novel unsupervised method to utilize syntactic dependency paths to recognize
complementary entities. Then we expand category-level domain knowledge about
complementary entities using only a few general seed verbs on a large amount of
unlabeled reviews. The domain knowledge helps the unsupervised method to adapt
to different products and greatly improves the precision of the CER task. The
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require any labeled data
for training. We conducted experiments on 7 popular products with about 1200
reviews in total to demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective.

distributions $P$ and $Q$, respectively, over the same finite set, with access
to shared randomness. Without any communication, the two players are each
required to output an element sampled according to their respective
distributions, while trying to minimize the probability that their outputs
disagree. A well known strategy due to Kleinberg-Tardos and Holenstein, with a
close variant (for a similar problem) due to Broder, solves this task with
disagreement probability at most $2 \delta/(1+\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the
total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. This strategy has been used in
several different contexts, including sketching algorithms, approximation
algorithms based on rounding linear programming relaxations, the study of
parallel repetition and cryptography.
  In this paper, we give a surprisingly simple proof that this strategy is
essentially optimal. Specifically, for every $\delta \in (0,1)$, we show that
any correlated sampling strategy incurs a disagreement probability of
essentially $2\delta/(1+\delta)$ on some inputs $P$ and $Q$ with total
variation distance at most $\delta$. This partially answers a recent question
of Rivest.
  Our proof is based on studying a new problem that we call ""constrained
agreement"". Here, the two players are given subsets $A \subseteq [n]$ and $B
\subseteq [n]$, respectively, and their goal is to output an element $i \in A$
and $j \in B$, respectively, while minimizing the probability that $i \neq j$.
We prove tight bounds for this question, which in turn imply tight bounds for
correlated sampling. Though we settle basic questions about the two problems,
our formulation leads to more fine-grained questions that remain open.

ionized gas rotation curve maximum for the galaxies. Our VTD galaxies have low
dust content, in contrast to regular disc galaxies. Apparently, VTD galaxies
reside in specific cosmological low-density environments and tend to have less
connection with filaments. Comparing a toy model that assumes marginally low
star formation in galactic discs with obtained gas kinematics data, we conclude
that there is a threshold central surface density of about 88 Mo/pc**2, which

Magnetometer usage is often troublesome, as it is prone to be interfered by
onboard or ambient magnetic disturbance. The onboard soft-iron material
distorts not only the magnetic field, but the magnetometer sensor frame
coordinate and the cross-sensor misalignment relative to inertial sensors. It
is desirable to conveniently put magnetic and inertial sensors information in a
common frame. Existing methods either split the problem into successive
intrinsic and cross-sensor calibrations, or rely on stationary accelerometer
measurements which is infeasible in dynamic conditions. This paper formulates
the magnetometer calibration and alignment to inertial sensors as a state
estimation problem, and collectively solves the magnetometer intrinsic and
cross-sensor calibrations, as well as the gyroscope bias estimation. Sufficient
conditions are derived for the problem to be globally observable, even when no
accelerometer information is used at all. An extended Kalman filter is designed
to implement the state estimation and comprehensive test data results show the
superior performance of the proposed approach. It is immune to acceleration

rises from $\sim$$63\%$ to $\sim$$95\%$ in the rising phase, and keeps a high

others are passive. Active objects can, if they possess information, share it
with an encountered passive object. We focus on a particular case such that
active objects communicate independently with randomly chosen passive objects.
Such model is motivated by two real-life scenarios. The first one is a very
dynamic system of mobile devices distributing information among stationary
devices. The second is an architecture wherein clients communicate with several
servers and can leave some information learnt from other servers. The main
question we investigate is how many rounds is needed to deliver the information
to all objects under the assumption that at the beginning exactly one object
has the information?
  In this paper we provide mathematical models of such process and show rigid
and very precise mathematical analysis for some special cases important from
practical point of view. Some mathematical results are quite surprising -- we
find relation of investigated process to both coupon collector's problem as

been explored systematically. In this paper, the universal design factors of
image CAPTCHAs, such as image layouts, quantities, sizes, tilting angles and
colors were experimentally evaluated through the following four dimensions:
eye-tracking, efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. The cognitive
processes revealed by eye-tracking indicate that the distribution of eye gaze
is equally assigned to each candidate image and irrelevant to the variation of
image contents. In addition, the gazing plot suggests that more than 70% of the
participants inspected CAPTCHA images row-by-row, which is more efficient than
scanning randomly. Those four-dimensional evaluations essentially suggest that
square and horizontal rectangle are the preferred layout; image quantities may
not exceed 16 while the image color is insignificant. Meanwhile, the image size
and tilting angle are suggested to be larger than 55 pixels x 55 pixels and
within -45~45 degrees, respectively. Basing on those usability experiment
results, we proposed a design guideline that is expected to be useful for
developing more usable image CAPTCHAs.

Eur. Phys. J. Plus 130 (2015) 130] and the $\Lambda$CDM model. These two models
behave similarly at large (cosmological) scales up to the present. Differences
will appear only in the far future, in about $25\, {\rm Gyrs}$, when the
Logotropic Universe becomes phantom while the $\Lambda$CDM Universe enters in
the de Sitter era. However, the Logotropic model differs from the $\Lambda$CDM
model at small (galactic) scales, where the latter encounters serious problems.
Having a nonvanishing pressure, the Logotropic model can solve the cusp problem
and the missing satellite problem of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, it
leads to dark matter halos with a constant surface density $\Sigma_0=\rho_0
r_h$, and can explain its observed value $\Sigma_0=141 \, M_{\odot}/{\rm pc}^2$
without adjustable parameter. This makes the logotropic model rather unique
among all the models attempting to unify dark matter and dark energy. In this
paper, we compare the Logotropic and $\Lambda$CDM models at the cosmological
scale where they are very close to each other in order to determine
quantitatively how much they differ. This comparison is facilitated by the fact
that these models depend on only two parameters, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and
the present fraction of dark matter $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. Using the latest
observational data from Planck 2015+Lensing+BAO+JLA+HST, we find that the best
fit values of $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ are $H_0=68.30\, {\rm km}\, {\rm
s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.3014$ for the Logotropic model,
and $H_0=68.02\, {\rm km}\, {\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{\rm

on single-label image classification, and various progress also have been made
to apply CNN methods on multi-label image classification, which requires to
annotate objects, attributes, scene categories etc. in a single shot. Recent
state-of-the-art approaches to multi-label image classification exploit the
label dependencies in an image, at global level, largely improving the labeling
capacity. However, predicting small objects and visual concepts is still
challenging due to the limited discrimination of the global visual features. In
this paper, we propose a Regional Latent Semantic Dependencies model (RLSD) to
address this problem. The utilized model includes a fully convolutional
localization architecture to localize the regions that may contain multiple
highly-dependent labels. The localized regions are further sent to the
recurrent neural networks (RNN) to characterize the latent semantic
dependencies at the regional level. Experimental results on several benchmark
datasets show that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to
the state-of-the-art models, especially for predicting small objects occurred
in the images. In addition, we set up an upper bound model (RLSD+ft-RPN) using
bounding box coordinates during training, the experimental results also show
that our RLSD can approach the upper bound without using the bounding-box
annotations, which is more realistic in the real world.

reduces the energy loss in the exciton diffusion-dissociation process, and
thus, significantly improves the device efficiency especially for the

performances are comprehensively investigated under the conditions of
short-circuit and open-circuit. Particularly, bulk recombination dependent fill

is non-trivial, particularly when they are curved. One technique that may be

measuring the applied force and displacement. This gives immediate information
on the fracture strength of the material (from the force required to puncture),
but it is also theoretically possible to determine the elastic properties by
comparing the resulting force-displacement curves with a mathematical model.
Existing mathematical studies generally assume that the elastic surface is
initially flat, which is often not the case for biological membranes. We
previously outlined a theory for the indentation of curved isotropic,
incompressible, hyperelastic membranes (with no bending stiffness) which breaks
down for highly curved surfaces, as the entire membrane becomes wrinkled. Here
we introduce the effect of bending stiffness, ensuring that energy is required
to change the shell shape without stretching, and find that commonly neglected
terms in the shell equilibrium equation must be included. The theory presented
here allows for the estimation of shape- and size-independent elastic

alternative steady states among individual living cells, inducing phenotypic
variability. The effects of white noise on the regime shift in bistable systems
have been well characterized, however little is known about such effects of
colored noise (noise with non-zero correlation time). Here, we show that noise
correlation time, by considering a genetic circuit of autoactivation, can have
significant effect on the regime shift in gene expression. We demonstrate this
theoretically, using stochastic potential, stationary probability density
function and first-passage time based on the Fokker-Planck description, where
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used to model colored noise. We find that
increase in noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime
shift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable
regime, while increase in noise correlation time in basal rate retain the
bimodal distribution. We then show how cross-correlated colored noises in basal
and degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein
concentration state, but reduce the bistable regime. In addition, we show that
early warning indicators can also be used to predict shifts between distinct
phenotypic states in gene expression. Predictions that a cell is about to shift
to a harmful phenotype could improve early therapeutic intervention in complex

duct flows is studied by means of direct numerical simulations of the carrier
phase turbulence with one-way coupled Lagrangian particles. The geometries are
a square and a rectangular duct with width-to-height aspect ratio $AR$ of 3
operating at $Re_{\tau,c}=360$ . The present study is designed to determine the
effect of turbulence-driven secondary motion on the particle dynamics. Our
results show that a weak cross-flow secondary motion significantly changes the
cross-sectional map of the particle concentration, mean velocity and
fluctuations. As the geometry of the duct is widened from $AR=1$ to 3, the
secondary vortex on the horizontal wall significantly expands in the spanwise
direction, and although the kinetic energy of the secondary flow increases
close to the corner, it decays towards the duct centreplane in the $AR=3$ case
so as the turbulent carrier phase approaches the behavior in spanwise-periodic
channel flows, a fact that significantly affects the particle statistics. In
the square duct the particle concentration in the viscous sublayer is maximum
at the duct centreplane, whereas the maximum is found closer to the corner, at
a distance of $|z/h|\approx1.25$ from the centreplane, in the $AR=3$ case.
Interestingly the centreplane concentration in the rectangular duct is around 3
times lower than that in the square duct. Moreover, a second peak in the
accumulation distribution is found right at the corners for both ducts. At this
location the concentration increases with particle inertia. The secondary
motion changes also the cross-stream map of the particle velocities
significantly in comparison to the fluid flow statistics. These directly affect
the particle velocity fluctuations such that multiple peaks appear near the
duct walls for the particle streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations.

process also can be done in parallel. Second, along with the Kronecker

weighted $\ell_1$-minimization methods for reconstruction. Furthermore,
conventional methods for BCS consider an equal number of samples for all
blocks. However, the sparsity order of blocks in natural images could be
different and, therefore, a various number of samples could be required for
their reconstruction. Motivated by this point, we will adaptively allocate the
samples for each cube in a video sequence. Our aim is to show that our simple
linear sampling approach can be competitive with the other state-of-the-art

investigated using hydrographic observations combined with satellite
observations of sea-surface height. A three-dimensional (spatial and vertical)
estimate of the isopycnal eddy-diffusivity in the Southern Ocean is obtained
using the theory of Ferrari & Nikurashin (2010), that includes the influence of
suppression of the diffusivity by the strong, time-mean flows. It is found that
the eddy diffusivity is enhanced at depth, reaching a maximum at the ""critical
layer"" near 1000m. The estimate of diffusivity is used with a simple diffusive
parameterization to estimate the meridional eddy volume flux. Together with an
estimate of the meridional Ekman transport and the time-mean meridional
geostrophic transport, the eddy volume flux is used to reconstruct the
time-mean overturning circulation. By comparing the reconstruction with, and
without, suppression of the eddy diffusivity by the mean flow, the influence of
the suppression on the overturning is illuminated. It is shown that the
suppression of the eddy diffusivity results in a large reduction of interior
eddy transports, and a more realistic eddy induced overturning circulation.
Finally, a simple conceptual model is used to show that the MOC is influenced
not only by the existence of enhanced diffusivity at depth, but also by the
details of the vertical structure of the eddy diffusivity, such as the depth of
the critical layer.

flexibility it offers for customers as well as for providers has become a
crucial factor for large parts of the computer industry. Virtualization is the
key technology that allows for sharing of hardware resources among different
customers. The controlling software component, called hypervisor, provides a
virtualized view of the computer resources and ensures separation of different
guest virtual machines. However, this important cornerstone of cloud computing
is not necessarily trustworthy. To mitigate this threat AMD introduced Secure
Encrypted Virtualization, short SEV. SEV is a processor extension that encrypts
guest memory in order to prevent a potentially malicious hypervisor from
accessing guest data. In this paper we analyse whether the proposed features
can resist a malicious hypervisor and discuss the trade-offs imposed by
additional protection mechanisms. To do so, we developed a model of SEV's
security capabilities based on the available documentation as actual silicon
implementations are not yet on the market. We found that the currently proposed
version of SEV is not up to the task owing to three design shortcomings. First,
as with standard AMD-V, under SEV, the virtual machine control block is not
encrypted and handled directly by the hypervisor, allowing him to bypass VM
memory encryption by executing conveniently chosen gadgets. Secondly, the
general purpose registers are not encrypted upon vmexit, leaking potentially
sensitive data. Finally, the control of the nested pagetables allows a
malicious hypervisor to closely control the execution of a VM and attack it
with memory replay attacks.

analytical theory, a numerical self-consistent field approach, and Monte Carlo

distribution. We specifically focus on three different polydispersities
representing sharp, moderate and extremely wide chain length distributions and
derive explicit analytical expressions for the chain end distributions in these
brushes. The results are in very good agreement with numerical data obtained
with self-consistent field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. With
increasing polydispersity, the brush density profile changes from convex to
concave, and for given average chain length $N_n$ and grafting density
$\sigma$, the brush height $H$ is found to scale as
$(H/H_{\mathrm{mono}}-1)\propto(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$ over a wide range of
polydispersity indices $N_w/N_n$ (here $H_{\mathrm{mono}}$ is the height of the
corresponding monodisperse brush. Chain end fluctuations are found to be
strongly suppressed already at very small polydispersity. Based on this
observation, we introduce the concept of the brush as a near-critical system
with two parameters (scaling variables), $(N_{n}\sigma^{2/3})^{-1}$ and
$(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$, controlling the distance from the critical point. This
approach provides a good description of the simulation data. Finally we study
the hydrodynamic penetration length $l_\mathrm{p}$ for brush-coated surfaces in
flow. We find that it generally increases with polydispersity. The scaling
behavior crosses over from $l_\mathrm{p}\sim N_\mathrm{n}^{1/2}\sigma^{-1/6}$
for monodisperse and weakly polydisperse brushes to $l_\mathrm{p}\sim
N_{n}^{2/3}$ for strongly polydisperse brushes.

magnetic field form the Hofstadter butterfly pattern. We study the evolution of
this pattern as a function of bond percolation disorder (removal or dilution of
lattice bonds). With increasing concentration of the bonds removed, the
butterfly pattern gets smoothly decimated. However, in this process of
decimation, bands develop interesting characteristics and features. For
example, in the high disorder limit, some butterfly-like pattern still persists
even as most of the states are localized. We also analyze, in the low disorder
limit, the effect of percolation on wavefunctions (using inverse participation
ratios) and on band gaps in the spectrum. We explain and provide the reasons
behind many of the key features in our results by analyzing small clusters and
finite size rings. Furthermore, we study the effect of bond dilution on
transverse conductivity($\sigma_{xy}$). We show that starting from the clean
limit, increasing disorder reduces $\sigma_{xy}$ to zero, even though the
strength of percolation is smaller than the classical percolation threshold.
This shows that the system undergoes a direct transition from a integer quantum
Hall state to a localized Anderson insulator beyond a critical value of bond
dilution. We further find that the energy bands close to the band edge are more
stable to disorder than at the band center. To arrive at these results we use
the coupling matrix approach to calculate Chern numbers for disordered systems.

Two

corresponds to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The term defined by the boundary area
is proportional to the third power of temperature and inversely proportional to
the emitter's effective size, which is defined as the ratio of its volume to
its boundary area. It is shown that the cubic temperature contribution is

It is also quantitatively confirmed by data from the NIST calibration of

validity of which was shown well"" in textbooks. However in this paper, we
indicate that this conjecture has never been proved mathematically. By
enumerating a counterexample, we find that this mathematical conjecture is
flawed, and it is not persuasive to use a flawed mathematical conjecture as a
starting point to resolve Abraham-Minkowski controversy over light momentum in
a dielectric medium. We also indicate that this flawed mathematical conjecture
is actually a widely-accepted conjecture in the dynamics of relativity in
textbooks for many decades. To eliminate a misunderstanding of this flawed
conjecture in the community, we provide a detailed elucidation of why
M{\o}ller's mathematical statement, also called ""M{\o}ller's version of von
Laue's theorem"", only defines a trivial zero 4-vector for an electromagnetic
stress-energy Lorentz 4-tensor.

alternative gravity theories to General Relativity and cosmology and torsion
detection by showing how they can simply used in the investigation of helicity
and magnetic energy spectra of primordial fields by using a strong value of
torsion of $10MeV$ previously computed by the author. dynamo mechanism seeds in
the Primordial Universe has been a matter of intense investigation lately. The
second purpose is to apply these torsion theories in the special random spins
gauge where its time component torsion gauge $T^{0}=0$, which implies that
spins of the nucleons are polarised orthogonal to QCD domain walls. A
modification of circular polarization at $1Mpc$ scale, give rise to left
torsion helicity which using a QCD seed $B_{QCD}\sim{10^{16}G}$ yields MF of
$B_{-}\sim{10^{30}Gauss}$ which was the value obtained by Enqvist et al using
neutrinos and galactic dynamos at QED scales. The $B_{+}$ mode can be shown to
constrain torsion to $T\sim{10^{7}Mev}$ at $1pc$ which can be detected at LHC
scales. These constraints at 1Mpc reach only $10^{-10}MeV$

Traditional organic
solvents easily reach the atmosphere as they have high vapor pressure and are
linked to a host of negative environmental effects including climate change,
urban air-quality and human illness. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL), on
the other hand, have low vapor pressure and are not flammable or explosive,
thereby resulting in fewer environmental burdens and health hazards. However,
their life cycle environmental impacts as well as freshwater ecotoxicity
implications are poorly understood. RTILs are molten salts that exist as
liquids at relatively low temperatures and have unique properties. Ionic
liquids consist of a large organic cation and charge-delocalized inorganic or
organic anion of smaller size and asymmetric shape. The organic cation can
undergo unlimited structural variations through modification of the alkyl
groups attached to the side chain of the base cation skeleton and most of these
structural variations are feasible, from chemical synthesis point of view, due
to the easy nature of preparation of their components. Functionally, ionic
liquids can be tuned to impart specific desired properties by switching
anions/cations or by incorporating functionalities into the cations/anions. It
is estimated that theoretically more than a trillion ionic liquid structures
can be formed. Due to their tunable nature, these molten salts have the
potential to be used as solvents for variety of applications.

which captures the stationary density-flow relationships in both uncongested
and congestion conditions. The proposed model is based on the $M/g/c/c$ state
dependent queuing model of Jain and Smith, and is inspired from the
deterministic Godunov scheme for the road traffic simulation. We first propose
a reformulation of the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent model that works with
density-flow fundamental diagrams rather than density-speed relationships. We
then extend this model in order to consider upstream traffic demand as well as
downstream traffic supply. Finally, we calculate the speed and travel time
distributions for the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model and for the
proposed model, and derive stationary performance measures (expected number of
cars, blocking probability, expected travel time, and throughput). A comparison
with results predicted by the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model shows
that the proposed model correctly represents the dynamics of traffic and gives
good performances measures. The results illustrate the good accuracy of the
proposed model.
