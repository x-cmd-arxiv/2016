elements and an ordered basis a lexicographic ordering of the module R^n is
produced. This is used to set up a greedy algorithm that selects vectors for
which all linear combination with the previously selected vectors satisfy a
pre-specified selection property and updates the to-be-constructed code to the
linear hull of the vectors selected so far. The output is called a lexicode.
This process was discussed earlier in the literature for fields and chain
rings. In this paper we investigate the properties of such lexicodes over
finite principal left ideal rings and show that the total ordering of the ring
elements has to respect containment of ideals in order for the algorithm to
produce meaningful results. Only then it is guaranteed that the algorithm is
exhaustive and thus produces codes that are maximal with respect to inclusion.
It is further illustrated that the output of the algorithm heavily depends on
the total ordering and chosen basis.

is combined with a penalized and constrained multinomial logit model. It is
shown that this synthesis yields a powerful classification tool for functional
data (possibly mixed with non-functional predictors), which also provides
automatic variable selection. The choice of an appropriate, sparsity-inducing
penalty allows to estimate most model coefficients to exactly zero, and permits
class-specific coefficients in multiclass problems, such that feature selection
is obtained. An additional constraint within the multinomial logit model
ensures that the model coefficients can be considered as weights. Thus, the
estimation results become interpretable with respect to the discriminative
importance of the selected features, which is rated by a feature importance
measure. In two application examples, data of a cell chip used for water

The electrons self-organization is expected to yield complex intra and inter

unambiguous experimental proof of such complex orders, namely the direct
observation of distinct dispersions, is still missing. Here we report a Nano

membrane curvature leads to the appearance of a prominent additional peak in

the curved membrane involves a contribution from surface-normal displacements
which is not the case for planar membranes. In the vanishing frequency limit,
the particle self-mobility near a no-slip hard sphere is recovered only when
the membrane possesses a non-vanishing resistance towards shearing. We further
investigate capsule motion, finding that the pair-mobility function is solely
determined by membrane shearing properties. Our analytical predictions are
validated by fully resolved boundary integral simulations where a very good

represents a potential systematic for measurements of the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) scale. The relative velocity effect is sourced by the
different evolution of baryon and cold dark matter perturbations before
decoupling. Our power spectrum model includes all $1$-loop redshift-space terms
corresponding to $v_{\rm bc}$ parameterised by the bias parameter $b_{v^2}$. We
also include the linear terms proportional to the relative density,
$\delta_{\rm bc}$, and relative velocity dispersion, $\theta_{\rm bc}$, which
we parameterise with the bias parameters $b^{\rm bc}_{\delta}$ and $b^{\rm
bc}_{\theta}$. Our data does not support a detection of the relative velocity
effect in any of these parameters. Combining the low and high redshift bins of
BOSS, we find limits of $b_{v^2} = 0.012 \pm 0.015\;(\pm 0.031)$, $b^{\rm

restrict the potential systematic shift in $D_A(z)$, $H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8$,

the current uncertainties on the BAO measurements of BOSS these shifts

plateau-like scalar potential within the framework of fluctuation-dissipation
dynamics. We consider, in particular, that inflation was preceded by a
radiation-dominated epoch where the inflaton is coupled to light degrees of
freedom and may reach a near-equilibrium state. We show that the homogeneous
field component can be sufficiently localized at the origin to trigger a period
of slow-roll if the interactions between the inflaton and the thermal degrees
of freedom are sufficiently strong and argue that this does not necessarily
spoil the flatness of the potential at the quantum level. We further conclude
that the inflaton can still be held at the origin after its potential begins to
dominate the energy balance, leading to a period of thermal inflation. This
then suppresses the effects of nonlinear interactions between the homogeneous
and inhomogeneous field modes that could prevent the former from entering a
slow-roll regime. Finally, we discuss the possibility of an early period of
chaotic inflation, at large field values, followed by a first stage of
reheating and subsequently by a second inflationary epoch along the plateau
about the origin. This scenario could prevent an early overclosure of the
Universe, at the same time yielding a low tensor-to-scalar ratio in agreement
with observations.

magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with an initial, vertical, homogeneous

highlight the effect of magnetic fields on the internal gravity wave
propagation in the Sun's atmosphere. We find that the internal gravity waves
are absent or partially reflected back into the lower layers in the presence of
magnetic fields and argue that the suppression is due to the coupling of
internal gravity waves to slow magneto acoustic waves still within the
high-beta region of the upper photosphere. The conversion to Alfven waves is
highly unlikely in our model because there is no strongly inclined magnetic
field present. We argue that the suppression of internal waves observed within

first step on the way to producing heavier nuclei. If the strong force were
slightly weaker, deuterium would not be stable, and many authors have noted
that nuclesynthesis would be compromised so that helium production could not
proceed through standard reaction chains. Motivated by the possibility that
other regions of space-time could have different values for the fundamental
constants, this paper considers stellar evolution in universes without stable
deuterium and argues that such universes can remain habitable. Even in
universes with no stellar nucleosynthesis, stars can form and will generate
energy through gravitational contraction. We show that such stars can be
sufficiently luminous and long-lived to support life. Stars with initial masses
that exceed the Chandrasekhar mass cannot be supported by degeneracy pressure
and explode at the end of their contraction phase. The resulting explosive
nucleosynthesis can provide the universe with some heavy elements. We also
explore the possibility that helium can be produced in stellar cores through a
triple-nucleon reaction (roughly analogous to the triple-alpha reaction). Next
we show that with even trace amounts of heavy elements --- produced through the
triple-nucleon process or by explosive nucleosynthesis --- the CNO cycle can
operate and allow stars to function. Finally, we consider Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis without stable deuterium and find that only trace amounts of
helium are produced, with even smaller abundances of other nuclei. With stars
evolving through gravitational contraction, explosive nucleosynthesis, the
triple-nucleon reaction, and the CNO cycle, universes with no stable deuterium
are thus potentially habitable, contrary to many previous claims.

free energy of the black brane solutions to scale with the same N dependence as
the solution obtained by Guarino et al.. In this note, we will reproduce the
exotic N dependence of the free energy of such black brane solutions from field
theory at finite temperature using the Smilga-Wiseman approach. The free energy
expression thus obtained also tells us about the temperature dependence of free
energy of such black brane solutions in a given low temperature regime.

single buyer whose valuation $v$ for the items may exhibit both substitutes
(i.e., for some $S, T$, $v(S \cup T) < v(S) + v(T)$) and complements (i.e., for
some $S, T$, $v(S \cup T) > v(S) + v(T)$). We show that the mechanism first
proposed by Babaioff et al. [2014] - the better of selling the items separately
and bundling them together - guarantees a $\Theta(d)$ fraction of the optimal
revenue, where $d$ is a measure on the degree of complementarity. Note that
this is the first approximately optimal mechanism for a buyer whose valuation
exhibits any kind of complementarity, and extends the work of Rubinstein and
Weinberg [2015], which proved that the same simple mechanisms achieve a
constant factor approximation when buyer valuations are subadditive, the most
general class of complement-free valuations.
  Our proof is enabled by the recent duality framework developed in Cai et al.
[2016], which we use to obtain a bound on the optimal revenue in this setting.
Our main technical contributions are specialized to handle the intricacies of
settings with complements, and include an algorithm for partitioning edges in a
hypergraph. Even nailing down the right model and notion of ""degree of

Modern object detection algorithms in astronomy are oriented towards detection

scientific interest as possible trails of fast flybys of near-Earth asteroids
and meteors. In this work we describe a new linear feature detection algorithm
designed specifically for implementation in Big Data astronomy. The algorithm
combines a series of algorithmic steps that first remove other objects (stars,
galaxies) from the image and then enhance the line to enable more efficient
line detection with the Hough algorithm. The rate of false positives is greatly
reduced thanks to a step that replaces possible line segments with rectangles
and then compares lines fitted to the rectangles with the lines obtained
directly from the image. The speed of the algorithm and its applicability in
astronomical surveys are also discussed.

astrophysics. One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the
evolutionary state of the individual stars -- i.e. have they started to burn
Helium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data
provide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is an
highly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of
the power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can
provide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the
dipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to
determine some measures that are used in the categorisation. It does not
require that all the individual components of any given mode be separately
characterised. Some 6604 red giant stars have been classified. Of these 3566
are determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are
secondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low metallicity,
horizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondary-clump
stars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We
discuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead
to mis-categorisation in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were
not classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes
(so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the
parameters.

Poisson statistics and corrections to the thermodynamics limit become
logarithmic in $N$. In the conclusion, we present physical consequences of our

extend the visual question answering task to not only provide an answer but
also a natural language explanation for the answer. Second, we focus on
explaining human activities which is traditionally more challenging than object

stands for contour-based, parametric, superpositional intonation stylization.
In this framework intonation is represented as a superposition of global and
local contours that are described parametrically in terms of polynomial
coefficients. On the global level (usually associated but not necessarily
restricted to intonation phrases) the stylization serves to represent register
in terms of time-varying F0 level and range. On the local level (e.g. accent
groups), local contour shapes are described. From this parameterization several
features related to prosodic boundaries and prominence can be derived.
Furthermore, by coefficient clustering prosodic contour classes can be obtained
in a bottom-up way. Next to the stylization-based feature extraction also
standard F0 and energy measures (e.g. mean and variance) as well as rhythmic
aspects can be calculated. At the current state automatic annotation comprises:
segmentation into interpausal chunks, syllable nucleus extraction, and
unsupervised localization of prosodic phrase boundaries and prominent
syllables. F0 and partly also energy feature sets can be derived for: standard
measurements (as median and IQR), register in terms of F0 level and range,

Gestalt of accent groups in terms of their deviation from higher level prosodic
units, as well as for rhythmic aspects quantifying the relation between F0 and

great significance in the computer vision community. In order for a dense
labeling algorithm to be able to achieve accurate and precise results, it has
to consider the dependencies that exist in the joint space of both the input
and the output variables. An implicit approach for modeling those dependencies
is by training a deep neural network that, given as input an initial estimate
of the output labels and the input image, it will be able to predict a new
refined estimate for the labels. In this context, our work is concerned with
what is the optimal architecture for performing the label improvement task. We
argue that the prior approaches of either directly predicting new label
estimates or predicting residual corrections w.r.t. the initial labels with
feed-forward deep network architectures are sub-optimal. Instead, we propose a
generic architecture that decomposes the label improvement task to three steps:
1) detecting the initial label estimates that are incorrect, 2) replacing the
incorrect labels with new ones, and finally 3) refining the renewed labels by
predicting residual corrections w.r.t. them. Furthermore, we explore and
compare various other alternative architectures that consist of the
aforementioned Detection, Replace, and Refine components. We extensively
evaluate the examined architectures in the challenging task of dense disparity
estimation (stereo matching) and we report both quantitative and qualitative
results on three different datasets. Finally, our dense disparity estimation
network that implements the proposed generic architecture, achieves
state-of-the-art results in the KITTI 2015 test surpassing prior approaches by
a significant margin.

3D shape as a set of binary variables corresponding to 3D voxels of a uniform
3D grid centered on the shape, and resorts to deep convolutional neural
networks(CNNs) for modeling these binary variables. Robust learning of such
CNNs is currently limited by the small datasets of 3D shapes available, an
order of magnitude smaller than other common datasets in computer vision.
Related work typically deals with the small training datasets using a number of
ad hoc, hand-tuning strategies. To address this issue, we formulate CNN
learning as a beam search aimed at identifying an optimal CNN architecture,
namely, the number of layers, nodes, and their connectivity in the network, as
well as estimating parameters of such an optimal CNN. Each state of the beam
search corresponds to a candidate CNN. Two types of actions are defined to add
new convolutional filters or new convolutional layers to a parent CNN, and thus
transition to children states. The utility function of each action is
efficiently computed by transferring parameter values of the parent CNN to its
children, thereby enabling an efficient beam search. Our experimental
evaluation on the 3D ModelNet dataset demonstrates that our model pursuit using
the beam search yields a CNN with superior performance on 3D shape
classification than the state of the art.

base stations (BSs) in unlicensed bands. We denote such system as massive MIMO
unlicensed (mMIMO-U). We design the key procedures required at a cellular BS to
guarantee coexistence with nearby Wi-Fi devices operating in the same band. In
particular, spatial reuse is enhanced by actively suppressing interference
towards neighboring Wi-Fi devices. Wi-Fi interference rejection is also
performed during an enhanced listen-before-talk (LBT) phase. These operations
enable Wi-Fi devices to access the channel as though no cellular BSs were
transmitting, and vice versa. Under concurrent Wi-Fi and BS transmissions, the
downlink rates attainable by cellular user equipment (UEs) are degraded by the
Wi-Fi-generated interference. To mitigate this effect, we select a suitable set
of UEs to be served in the unlicensed band accounting for a measure of the
Wi-Fi/UE proximity. Our results show that the so-designed mMIMO-U allows
simultaneous cellular and Wi-Fi transmissions by keeping their mutual
interference below the regulatory threshold. Compared to a system without
interference suppression, Wi-Fi devices enjoy a median interference power
reduction of between 3 dB with 16 antennas and 18 dB with 128 antennas. With

of simultaneous state and parameters estimation arising in many areas of
research. The gradient-based schemes for adaptive Kalman filtering (KF) require
the corresponding filter sensitivity computations. The standard approach is
based on the direct differentiation of the KF equations. The shortcoming of
this strategy is a numerical instability of the conventional KF (and its
derivatives) with respect to roundoff errors. For decades, special attention
has been paid in the KF community for designing efficient filter
implementations that improve robustness of the estimator against roundoff. The
most popular and beneficial techniques are found in the class of square-root
(SR) or UD factorization-based methods. They imply the Cholesky decomposition
of the corresponding error covariance matrix. Another important matrix
factorization method is the singular value decomposition (SVD) and, hence,
further encouraging KF algorithms might be found under this approach.
Meanwhile, the filter sensitivity computation heavily relies on the use of
matrix differential calculus. Previous works on the robust KF derivative
computation have produced the SR- and UD-based methodologies. Alternatively, in
this paper we design the SVD-based approach. The solution is expressed in terms
of the SVD-based KF covariance quantities and their derivatives (with respect
to unknown system parameters). The results of numerical experiments illustrate
that although the newly-developed SDV-based method is algebraically equivalent
to the conventional approach and the previously derived SR- and UD-based
strategies, it outperforms the mentioned techniques for estimation accuracy in
ill-conditioned situations.

requires a combination of resolution and large three-dimensional data capture
provided by serial section electron microscopy (ssEM). The convergence of high
throughput ssEM imaging and improved tissue preparation methods now allows ssEM
capture of complete specimen volumes up to cubic millimeter scale. The
resulting multi-terabyte image sets span thousands of serial sections and must
be precisely registered into coherent volumetric forms in which neural circuits
can be traced and segmented. This paper introduces a Signal Whitening Fourier
Transform Image Registration approach (SWiFT-IR) under development at the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and its use to align mouse and zebrafish brain
datasets acquired using the wafer mapper ssEM imaging technology recently
developed at Harvard University. Unlike other methods now used for ssEM
registration, SWiFT-IR modifies its spatial frequency response during image
matching to maximize a signal-to-noise measure used as its primary indicator of
alignment quality. This alignment signal is more robust to rapid variations in
biological content and unavoidable data distortions than either phase-only or
standard Pearson correlation, thus allowing more precise alignment and
statistical confidence. These improvements in turn enable an iterative
registration procedure based on projections through multiple sections rather
than more typical adjacent-pair matching methods. This projection approach,
when coupled with known anatomical constraints and iteratively applied in a
multi-resolution pyramid fashion, drives the alignment into a smooth form that
properly represents complex and widely varying anatomical content such as the
full cross-section zebrafish data.

this is a nonperturbative phenomenon. A first principles calculation of the

ferroelectricity can be induced in the representative case of strained KTaO$_3$

possible to arbitrarily switch off the light-induced ferroelectric state,

set of observations and/or measurements that allow to identify the real cause
of a fault. Therefore, diagnosis systems often return many possible candidates,
leaving the burden of selecting the correct diagnosis to a user. Sequential
diagnosis techniques solve this problem by automatically generating a sequence
of queries to some oracle. The answers to these queries provide additional
information necessary to gradually restrict the search space by removing
diagnosis candidates inconsistent with the answers.
  During query computation, existing sequential diagnosis methods often require
the generation of many unnecessary query candidates and strongly rely on
expensive logical reasoners. We tackle this issue by devising efficient
heuristic query search methods. The proposed methods enable for the first time
a completely reasoner-free query generation while at the same time guaranteeing
optimality conditions, e.g. minimal cardinality or best understandability, of
the returned query that existing methods cannot realize. Hence, the performance
of this approach is independent of the (complexity of the) diagnosed system.
Experiments conducted using real-world problems show that the new approach is
highly scalable and outperforms existing methods by orders of magnitude.

class of high order accurate reconstruction based discontinuous Galerkin (DG)

while piecewise polynomials $w_h$ of degree $M \geq N$ are used for the
computation of the volume and boundary fluxes. The piecewise polynomials $w_h$
are obtained from $u_h$ via a suitable reconstruction or recovery operator. The
$P_NP_M$ approach contains high order finite volume methods ($N=0$) as well as
classical DG schemes ($N=M$) as special cases of a more general framework.
Furthermore, for $N \neq M$ and $N>0$, it leads to a new intermediate class of
methods, which can be denoted either as Hermite finite volume or as
reconstructed DG methods. We show analytically why $P_NP_M$ methods for $N \neq

well-known cell entropy inequality and the following $L^2$ stability result of
Jiang and Shu for DG methods (i.e. for $N=M$) to the general $P_NP_M$ case and
identify which part in the reconstruction step may cause the instability. With

weight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that

physical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code. Moreover, benefiting
from the twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by lattice surgery without
the need for state distillation. By a surgical transformation to the surface
code, we also develop a scheme of doing all Clifford gates on surface code
patches in an atypical planar layout, though with less qubit efficiency than
the triangle code. Finally, we remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle

remains open in the general case under individual per-antenna (PA) power
constraints, while some special cases have been solved. These include a
full-rank solution for the MIMO channel and a general solution for the
multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. In this paper, the fixed Gaussian
MISO channel is considered and its capacity as well as optimal transmission
strategies are determined in a closed form under the joint total and
per-antenna power constraints in the general case. In particular, the optimal
strategy is hybrid and includes two parts: first is equal-gain transmission and
second is maximum-ratio transmission, which are responsible for the PA and TP
constraints respectively. The optimal beamforming vector is given in a
closed-form and an accurate yet simple approximation to the capacity is
proposed. Finally, the above results are extended to the MIMO case by
establishing the ergodic capacity of fading MIMO channels under the joint power
constraints when the fading distribution is right unitary-invariant (of which
i.i.d. and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading are special cases). Unlike the fixed
MISO case, the optimal signaling is shown to be isotropic in this case.

a differential graded associative algebra (dga) to the singular chains on the

dga isomorphic to $\Omega Q_{\Delta}(S)$, the cobar construction on the dg
coalgebra $Q_{\Delta}(S)$ of normalized chains on $S$. We use these facts to

imaging modalities. It provides a powerful tool for the analysis of different
organs and non-invasive tissues. Therefore, significant amount of research has
been conducted to explore the possibility of using spectral imaging in
biomedical applications. To observe spectral image information in real time
during surgery and monitor the temporal changes in the organs and tissues is a
demanding task. Available spectral imaging devices are not sufficient to
accomplish this task with an acceptable spatial and spectral resolution. A
solution to this problem is to estimate the spectral video from RGB video and
perform visualization with the most prominent spectral bands. In this research,
we propose a framework to generate neurosurgery spectral video from RGB video.
A spectral estimation technique is applied on each RGB video frames. The RGB
video is captured using a digital camera connected with an operational
microscope dedicated to neurosurgery. A database of neurosurgery spectral
images is used to collect training data and evaluate the estimation accuracy. A
searching technique is used to identify the best training set. Five different
spectrum estimation techniques are experimented to indentify the best method.
Although this framework is established for neurosurgery spectral video
generation, however, the methodology outlined here would also be applicable to
other similar research.

implementation of the type I seesaw mechanism in a warped extra dimensional
framework is in reality a {\em natural} realization of ""inverse"" seesaw, i.e.,
the Standard Model (SM) neutrino mass is dominantly generated by exchange of
pseudo-Dirac {\em TeV}-mass SM singlet neutrinos. By the AdS/CFT
correspondence, this scenario is {\em dual} to these singlet particles being
composites of some new strong dynamics, along with the SM Higgs boson, with the
rest of the SM particles being mostly elementary. We study signals from
production of these heavy neutrinos at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We
focus on the scenario where the strong sector has a global $SU(2)_{\rm L}
\times SU(2)_{\rm R} \times U(1)_{\rm X}$ symmetry; such a left-right (LR)
structure being motivated by consistency with the electroweak (EW) precision
tests. The singlet neutrinos are charged under $SU(2)_{\rm R} \times U(1)_{\rm
X}$ symmetry, thus can be produced from $W^{ \pm }_R$ exchange, as in
four-dimensional (4D) LR symmetric models. However, the direct coupling of
light quarks to $W^{ \pm }_R$ is negligible, due to $W^{ \pm }_R$ also being
composite; nonetheless, a sizable coupling can be induced by mixings among the
various types of $W^{ \pm }$ bosons. Furthermore, $W^{ \pm }_R$ decays
dominantly into the singlet and {\em composite} partner of charged lepton. This
heavy charged lepton, in turn, decays into SM lepton, {\em plus} $Z$/Higgs,
thus the latter can be used for extra identification of the signal. For a
benchmark scenario with $W^{ \pm }_R$ of mass 2 TeV and singlet neutrino of
mass 750 GeV, we find that, in both the di-lepton + di-jet + Higgs and
tri-lepton + Higgs channels, significant evidence can be seen at the LHC14 for
an integrated luminosity of 300/fb and that even discovery is possible with
slightly more luminosity.

We also divide superclusters, according to their morphology, into filament- and

these results and the direct correlation between cluster substructure and SF.
These results indicate that cluster SF is affected by both the dynamical age of
the cluster (younger systems exhibit higher amounts of SF); the large-scale
density of the supercluster environment (high-density core regions exhibit
lower amounts of SF); and supercluster morphology (spider-type superclusters

freedom are quark-antiquark and meson-meson components, we have recently shown
that the $D^{(\ast)}K$ thresholds play an important role in lowering the mass
of the physical $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states. This
observation is also supported by other theoretical approaches such as
lattice-regularised QCD or chiral unitary theory in coupled channels. Herein,
we extend our computation to the lowest $P$-wave $B_{s}$ mesons, taking into
account the corresponding $J^{P} = 0^{+}$, $1^{+}$ and $2^{+}$ bottom-strange
states predicted by the naive quark model and the $BK$ and $B^{\ast}K$
thresholds. We assume that mixing with $B_{s}^{(\ast)}\eta$ and
isospin-violating decays to $B_{s}^{(\ast)}\pi$ are negligible. This
computation is important because there is no experimental data in the
$b\bar{s}$ sector for the equivalent $j_{q}^{P}=1/2^{+}$
($D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$) heavy-quark multiplet and, as it has
been seen in the $c\bar s$ sector, the naive theoretical result can be wrong by
more than $100\,{\rm MeV}$. Our calculation allows to introduce the coupling
with the $D$-wave $B^{\ast}K$ channel and to compute the probabilities
associated with the different Fock components of the physical state.

the formation and interaction of mass ejected in a tidal tail and a disk wind.
The outflows are neutron-rich, giving rise to optical/infrared emission powered
by the radioactive decay of $r$-process elements (a kilonova). Here we perform
an end-to-end study of this phenomenon, where we start from the output of a
fully-relativistic merger simulation, calculate the post-merger hydrodynamical
evolution of the ejecta and disk winds including neutrino physics, determine
the final nucleosynthetic yields using post-processing nuclear reaction network
calculations, and compute the kilonova emission with a radiative transfer code.
We study the effects of the tail-to-disk mass ratio by scaling the tail
density. A larger initial tail mass results in fallback matter becoming mixed
into the disk and ejected in the subsequent disk wind. Relative to the case of
a disk without dynamical ejecta, the combined outflow has lower mean electron
fraction, faster speed, larger total mass, and larger absolute mass free of
high-opacity Lanthanides or Actinides. In most cases, the nucleosynthetic yield
is dominated by the heavy $r$-process contribution from the unbound part of the
tidal tail. A Solar-like abundance distribution can however be obtained when
the total mass of the dynamical ejecta is comparable to the mass of the disk
outflows. The kilonova has a characteristic duration of 1 week and a luminosity
of ~$10^{41}$ erg/s, with orientation effects leading to variations of a factor
~2 in brightness. At early times (< 1 day) the emission includes an optical
component from the (hot) Lanthanide-rich material, but the spectrum evolves
quickly to the infrared thereafter.

intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The transient, iPTF 16bco, was
detected by iPTF in the nucleus of a galaxy with an archival SDSS spectrum with
weak narrow-line emission characteristic of a low-ionization emission line
region (LINER). Our follow-up spectra show the dramatic appearance of broad
Balmer lines and a power-law continuum characteristic of a luminous
(L_bol~10^45 erg/s) type 1 quasar 12 years later. Our photometric monitoring
with PTF from 2009-2012, and serendipitous X-ray observations from the
XMM-Newton Slew Survey in 2011 and 2015, constrain the change of state to have
occurred less than 500 days before the iPTF detection. An enhanced broad Halpha
to [OIII]5007 line ratio in the type 1 state relative to other changing-look
quasars also is suggestive of the most rapid change of state yet observed in a
quasar. We argue that the >10 increase in Eddington ratio inferred from the
brightening in UV and X-ray continuum flux is more likely due to an intrinsic
change in the accretion rate of a pre-existing accretion disk, than an external
mechanism such as variable obscuration, microlensing, or the tidal disruption
of a star. However, further monitoring will be helpful in better constraining
the mechanism driving this change of state. The rapid ""turn on"" of the quasar
is much shorter than the viscous infall timescale of an accretion disk, and
requires a disk instability that can develop around a ~10^8 M_sun black hole on
timescales less than a year.

potential advantage over simple light curve statistics that the parameters may
be physically meaningful. Here, we survey a large sample of periodic,
quasi-periodic, and stochastic OGLE-III variables using the damped random walk
(DRW, CARMA(1,0)) and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO, CARMA(2,1)) stochastic
process models. The QPO model is described by an amplitude, a period, and a
coherence time-scale, while the DRW has only an amplitude and a time-scale. We
find that the periodic and quasi-periodic stellar variables are generally
better described by a QPO than a DRW, while quasars are better described by the
DRW model. There are ambiguities in interpreting the QPO coherence time due to
non-sinusoidal light curve shapes, signal-to-noise, error mischaracterizations,
and cadence. Higher-order implementations of the QPO model that better capture
light curve shapes are necessary for the coherence time to have its implied
physical meaning. Independent of physical meaning, the extra parameter of the
QPO model successfully distinguishes most of the classes of periodic and
quasi-periodic variables we consider.

in this setup it can be negative for any index $\alpha>2$ while it is always
positive for $\alpha <2.$ Interestingly, even for $\alpha>2$ the calculated
prefactors show some universal features: for example, the same prefactor is
also shown to govern the logarithmic time dependence of the R\'enyi mutual
information before the system relaxes locally to the steady state. In
particular, it can decrease in the non-equilibrium evolution after the quench.

train has an instability that depends strongly on the interaction strength and
the spacing of solitons. It can be stabilized by filling each soliton with an
unpaired fermion, thus forming a commensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase. We find that such a state is always dynamically stable, which
paves the way for realizing long-lived FFLO states in experiments via phase
imprinting.

for existing systems, since videos that present the same action, can be taken
from significantly different viewing directions, performed by different actors

significant role in these systems. In this work we propose the
""temporal-needle"" descriptor which captures the dynamic behavior, while being
invariant to viewpoint and appearance. The descriptor is computed using multi
temporal scales of the video and by computing self-similarity for every patch
through time in every temporal scale. The descriptor is computed for every
pixel in the video. However, to find similar actions across videos, we consider
only a small subset of the descriptors - the statistical significant
descriptors. This allow us to find good correspondences across videos more
efficiently. Using the descriptor, we were able to detect the same behavior
across videos in a variety of scenarios. We demonstrate the use of the
descriptor in tasks such as temporal and spatial alignment, action detection
and even show its potential in unsupervised video clustering into categories.
In this work we handled only videos taken with stationary cameras, but the

Our
technique is based on the notion that each latent cluster is comprised of
layers that surround its core, where the external layers, or border points,
implicitly separate the clusters. Unlike previous techniques, such as DBSCAN,
where the cores of the clusters are defined directly by their densities, here
the latent cores are revealed by a progressive peeling of the border points.
Analyzing the density of the local neighborhoods allows identifying the border
points and associating them with points of inner layers. We show that the
peeling process adapts to the local densities and characteristics to
successfully separate adjacent clusters (of possibly different densities). We
extensively tested our technique on large sets of labeled data, including
high-dimensional datasets of deep features that were trained by a convolutional
neural network. We show that our technique is competitive to other
state-of-the-art non-parametric methods using a fixed set of parameters
throughout the experiments.

of marker allele substitution effects, but it is known that these effects might

tool for covariance estimation in high dimensional problems and it is an area
that has recently experienced a great expansion. In Gaussian covariance graph
models (GCovGM), the joint distribution of a set of random variables is assumed
to be Gaussian and the pattern of zeros of the covariance matrix is encoded in
terms of an undirected graph G. In this study, methods adapting the theory of
GCovGM to genome-wide prediction were developed (Bayes GCov, Bayes GCov-KR and
Bayes GCov-H). In simulated and real datasets, improvements in correlation
between phenotypes and predicted breeding values and accuracies of predicted

proposed in previous studies which consider spatial correlation only. In
addition, they allow incorporation of biological information in the prediction
process through its use when constructing graph G, and their extension to the

techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from

first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate
similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as
k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice
of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities.
In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale
estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an
auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a
similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of
the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying

several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and
single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs
outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches.

that captures its main features is used to search for solutions as sourced by
matter. We find that sufficiently dense matter produces a novel horizonless

solution down to about a Planck proper length of the would-be horizon. The
2-2-hole is characterized by an interior with a shrinking volume and a
seemingly innocuous timelike curvature singularity. The interior also has a
novel scaling behavior with respect to the physical mass of the 2-2-hole. This
leads to an extremely deep gravitational potential in which particles get
efficiently trapped via collisions. As a generic static solution, the 2-2-hole
may then be the nearly black endpoint of gravitational collapse. There is a
considerable time delay for external probes of the 2-2-hole interior, and this

electronic imaging databases along with advances in deep neural networks with
machine learning has provided a unique opportunity to achieve milestones in
automated image analysis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most
commonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and
rich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to
determine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images
from images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Methods:
Automated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to
clinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg
Spectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted
from EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two
cohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a
random subset of patients. Area under receiver operator curves (auROC) were
constructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient
level. Results: Of an extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical
datapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were
selected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either
normal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an auROC of 92.78% with an
accuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an auROC of 93.83% with an
accuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an auROC of 97.45% with an
accuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were
92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques are
effective for classifying OCT images. These findings have important
implications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and computer aided
diagnosis tools.

critical state model is available for the description of irreversible
properties. Here we propose a plausible overall macroscopic model for both
reversible and irreversible properties, combining London theory and Bean's
model together based on superposition principle. First, a simple case where
there is no pinning is discussed, from which a microscopic basis for Bean's
model is explored. It is shown that a new concept of 'flux share' is needed
when the field is increased above the lower critical field. A portion of
magnetic flux is completely shielded, named as 'Meissner share' and the rest
penetrates through vortices, named as 'vortices share'. We argue that the flux
shares are irreversible if there is pinning. It is shown that the irreversible
flux shares can be the reason for observed peculiar reversible magnetization
behavior near zero field. The overall macroscopic model seems to be valuable
for the analysis of fundamental physical properties as well. As an example, it
is shown the origin of paramagnetic Meissner effect can be explained by the

inflaton field around its slowly rolling classical trajectory is converted into
a distribution of classical spacetimes inflating at different rates, and if the
variance is large enough compared to the rate of classical rolling that the
probability of an increased rate of expansion is sufficiently high. Both of
these criteria depend sensitively on whether and how perturbation modes of the
inflaton interact and decohere. Decoherence is inevitable as a result of
gravitationally-sourced interactions whose strength are proportional to the
slow-roll parameters. However, the weakness of these interactions means that
decoherence is typically delayed until several Hubble times after modes grow
beyond the Hubble scale. We present perturbative evidence that decoherence of
long-wavelength inflaton modes indeed leads to an ensemble of classical
spacetimes with differing cosmological evolutions. We introduce the notion of
per-branch observables---expectation values with respect to the different
decohered branches of the wave function---and show that the evolution of modes
on individual branches varies from branch to branch. Thus single-field
slow-roll inflation fulfills the quantum-mechanical criteria required for the
validity of the standard picture of eternal inflation. For a given potential,
the delayed decoherence can lead to slight quantitative adjustments to the
regime in which the inflaton undergoes eternal inflation.

an efficient and stable treatment of constraints. The key observation is that
the stability of the forward problem permits the construction of a large

to this database to generate a regression function of controlled complexity,
which returns approximate solutions for previously unseen inputs; the
approximate solutions are then projected onto the subspace of functions
satisfying relevant constraints. We also derive and present uncertainty
estimates. We illustrate the approach by applying it to the analytical
continuation problem of quantum many-body physics, which involves
reconstructing the frequency dependence of physical excitation spectra from
data obtained at specific points in the complex frequency plane. Under standard
error metrics the method performs as well or better than the Maximum Entropy

is introduced for air vehicles operating under varying flight states and
uncertainty. In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a
model that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible
flight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework
is based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics
and aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state
characterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack,
forming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class
of Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit
analytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and,
hence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype
bio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind
tunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor
networks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing
capabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the
identification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model
parameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector
defined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to
successfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the
admissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared
to standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the
high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification
framework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of
fly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities.

been the subject of widespread theoretical and experimental attention, both for
the perspective it offers on quantum reality and for possible applications to
precision measurement. Yet almost all of the weak-measurement experiments
carried out so far could be alternatively understood in terms of the classical
(electro-magnetic wave) theory of optics. Here we present a truly quantum
version, the first in which a measurement apparatus deterministically entangles
two distinct optical beams, enabling us to experimentally ask a question
directly analogous to that of the original proposal: ""In a two-arm
interferometer containing one photon in total, can the result of a measurement
of the photon number in one arm turn out to be greater than 1?"" Specifically,
we show that a single photon, when properly post-selected, can have an effect
equal to that of eight photons: that is, in a system where a single photon has
been calibrated to write a nonlinear phase shift of \phi_0 on a probe beam, we
measure phase shifts as large as 8\phi_0 for appropriately post-selected single
photons. This is the first deterministic weak-value experiment in optics which
defies classical explanation, and constitutes a realization of our proposal for
weak-value amplification (WVA) of the small optical nonlinearity at the
single-photon level. It opens up a new regime for the study of entanglement of
optical beams, as well as further investigations of the power of WVA for the
measurement of small quantities.

spectral transition from the hard state to the soft state, on a time scale of
~30 ks. Across the transition, the 0.8-10 keV XIS count rate increased by a
factor ~3, that of HXD-PIN in 15-60 keV decreased by a similar factor, and the
unabsorbed 0.1-100 keV luminosity increased from 3.5 times 10^37 erg/s to 5.1
times 10^37 erg/s. The broadband spectral shape changed continuously, from a
power-law like one with a high-energy cutoff to a more convex one. Throughout
the transition, the 0.8-60 keV spectra were successfully described with a model
consisting of a multi-color blackbody and a Comptonized blackbody, which are
considered to arise from a standard accretion disk and a closer vicinity of the
neutron star, respectively. All the model parameters were confirmed to change
continuously, from those typical in the hard state to those typical of the soft
state. More specifically, the inner disk radius decreased from 31 km to 18 km,
the effects of Comptonization on the blackbody photons weakened, and the
electron temperature of Comptonization decreased from 10 keV to 3 keV. The
derived parameters imply that the Comptonizing corona shrinks towards the final
soft state, and/or the radial infall velocity of the corona decreases. These
results reinforce the view that the soft and hard states of Aql X-1 (and of
similar objects) are described by the same ""disk plus Comptonized blackbody""

generated via dynamical symmetry breaking of scale-invariance. The
renormalisation group flows are computed and one-loop RG improved effective
potential of scalar is calculated. Scalar field develops a new minimum via
Coleman-Weinberg procedure inducing Newton's constant and masses in the matter

fluctuation gets a mass in the broken phase of theory. The energy-dependence of
VeV in the RG improved scenario implies a running for the induced parameters.
This sets up platform to ask whether it is possible to evade the spin-2 ghost
by keeping its mass always above the running energy scale? In broken phase this
question is satisfactorily answered for a large domain of coupling parameter
space where the ghost is evaded. The spin-0 mode can be made physically
realisable or not depending upon the choice of initial parameters. Induced
Newton's constant is seen to vanishes in ultraviolet. By properly choosing
parameters it is possible to make the matter fields physically unrealisable.

determine whether arbitrary systems are governed by causal relations of the
same form offers significant practical applications in the development and
validation of dynamical models. It is also of theoretical interest as an
essential stage in the scientific inference of laws from empirical data. The
algorithm presented is based on the dynamical symmetry approach to dynamical
kinds. A dynamical symmetry with respect to time is an intervention on one or
more variables of a system that commutes with the time evolution of the system.
A dynamical kind is a class of systems sharing a set of dynamical symmetries.
The algorithm presented classifies deterministic, time-dependent causal systems
by directly comparing their exhibited symmetries. Using simulated, noisy data
from a variety of nonlinear systems, we show that this algorithm correctly
sorts systems into dynamical kinds. It is robust under significant sampling
error, is immune to violations of normality in sampling error, and fails
gracefully with increasing dynamical similarity. The algorithm we demonstrate
is the first to address this aspect of automated scientific discovery.

have suggested that extragalactic cosmic-ray sources should have an optical
depth greater than $\sim$0.01 and contribute to more than 10\% of the observed
bulk of cosmic rays at 10 PeV. If the spectrum of cosmic rays from these
extragalactic sources extends well beyond 1 EeV, the neutrino flux indicates
that extragalactic cosmic-ray protons are dominant in the observed total
cosmic-ray flux at 1 EeV. Among known powerful astronomical objects, including
gamma-ray bursters (GRBs), only flat-spectrum radio quasars could (barely)
satisfy these conditions. On the other hand, the null detection of neutrinos
with energies well beyond PeV has excluded the possibility that radio-loud
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and/or GRBs, the popular source candidates
discussed in the literature, are the origins of the highest-energy cosmic rays
($\sim100 {\rm EeV}$) if they are composed mainly of protons. Their origins
must be objects that have evolved on time scales comparable to or slower than
the star formation rate. These considerations indicate that none of the known
extragalactic astronomical objects can be simultaneously a source of both PeV-
and trans-EeV-energy cosmic rays. As a result of the stringent limits on
EeV-energy neutrino fluxes, a significant part of the parameter space for the
AGN and new-born pulsar models is starting to seem unfavorable, even for

the existence of a ""mother"" tensor model which derives CTM through the

maximum in 1952, during the declining phase of solar cycle 18, verifying that
polar coronal holes had exceptionally persistent extensions just before the
peak of the Grand Modern Maximum of solar activity. On the other hand, solstice
speeds had their centennial maximum during the declining phase of solar cycle
23 due to large low-latitude coronal holes. A similar configuration of seasonal
speeds as in cycle 23 was not found earlier, not even during the less active

compare the impact of active and passive OpenFlow network state collection
methods on an SDN load-balancing application running at the controller using
key performance indicators that we define. We do this comparison through: (i) a
simulation of a mathematical model we derive for the SDN load-balancer, and
(ii) an evaluation of a load-balancing application running on top of single and

we study the impact of network scale on applications requiring an up-to-date

results show that both the network state collection and network state
distribution can have an impact on the SDN application performance. The more
the information at the controllers becomes outdated, the higher the impact
would be. Even with those applications that were designed to mitigate the
issues of controller state distribution, their performance was affected by the

years ago, the physical properties of the metals PdCoO2, PtCoO2 and PdCrO2 have
only more recently been studied in detail. The delafossite structure contains
triangular co-ordinated atomic layers, and electrical transport in the
delafossite metals is strongly two-dimensional. Their most notable feature is
their in-plane conductivity, which is amazingly high for oxide metals. At room
temperature, the conductivity of non-magnetic PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 is higher per
carrier than those of any alkali metal and even the most conductive elements,
copper and silver. At low temperatures the best crystals have resistivities of
a few n{\Omega}cm, corresponding to mean free paths of tens of microns. PdCrO2
is a frustrated antiferromagnetic metal, with magnetic scattering contributing
to the resistivity at high temperatures and small gaps opening in the Fermi
surface below the N\'eel temperature. There is good evidence that electronic
correlations are weak in the Pd/Pt layers but strong in the Co/Cr layers;
indeed the Cr layer in PdCrO2 is thought to be a Mott insulator. The
delafossite metals therefore act like natural heterostructures between strongly
correlated and nearly free electron sub-systems. Combined with the extremely
high conductivity, they provide many opportunities to study electrical
transport and other physical properties in new regimes. The purpose of this

data and the power of attention mechanism in automatically identify salient
information, image captioning, a.k.a., image description, has been remarkably
advanced in recent years. Nonetheless, most existing paradigms may suffer from
the deficiency of invariance to images with different scaling, rotation, etc.;
and effective integration of standalone attention to form a holistic end-to-end
system. In this paper, we propose a novel image captioning architecture, termed
Recurrent Image Captioner (\textbf{RIC}), which allows visual encoder and
language decoder to coherently cooperate in a recurrent manner. Specifically,
we first equip CNN-based visual encoder with a differentiable layer to enable
spatially invariant transformation of visual signals. Moreover, we deploy an
attention filter module (differentiable) between encoder and decoder to
dynamically determine salient visual parts. We also employ bidirectional LSTM
to preprocess sentences for generating better textual representations. Besides,
we propose to exploit variational inference to optimize the whole architecture.
Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (i.e., Flickr8k,
Flickr30k and MS COCO) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture
as compared to most of the state-of-the-art methods.

is very selective in all cases: we see very stable orbits in the vicinity of
chaotic ones. In the high order resonance transfer from initial to final orbit
take place by temporary capture in exact resonance. The large asteroids (Ceres,
Vesta) can made significant effect on dynamic of small bodies in resonance. In
some cases (as for Datura and Lucascavin family), their perturbations can

fascinating effects in the optical response of the hybrid system. Specifically,
we demonstrate that the system may exhibit picosecond and sub-picosecond
self-oscillations and quasi-chaotic behaviour under {\it single}-frequency

such features. The effects originate from competing one-exciton and bi-exciton
transitions in the semiconductor quantum dot, triggered by the self-action of
the quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle. The key parameter that governs the
phenomena mentioned is the ratio of the self-action strength and the bi-exciton
shift. The self-oscillation regime can be achieved in practice, in particular,
in a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced ZnS/ZnSe core-shell quantum dot
and a spherical silver nanoparticle. The results may have applications in

(FD) base station (BS) serving a set of half duplex (HD) mobile users.To cope
with the in-band self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference, we
formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) based linear transceiver design problem.
The problem jointly optimizes the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) beamforming
vectors of the BS and the transmission powers of UL users so as to provide both
the DL and UL users with guaranteed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
performance, using a minimum UL and DL transmission sum power.The considered
system model not only takes into account noise caused by non-ideal RF circuits,
analog/digital SI cancellation but also constrains the maximum signal power at
the input of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for avoiding signal
distortion due to finite ADC precision. The formulated design problem is not
convex and challenging to solve in general. We first show that for a special
case where the SI channel estimation errors are independent and identically
distributed, the QoS-based linear transceiver design problem is globally
solvable by a polynomial-time bisection algorithm.For the general case, we
propose a suboptimal algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO). The AO
algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution.To reduce
the complexity of the AO algorithm, we further develop a fixed-point method by
extending the classical uplink-downlink duality in HD systems to the FD

considers the unification of these two mechanisms, which have so far been
studied only separately. Exploring the enlarged parameter space, we find
kinematic restrictions that may prevent the fine-tuned particles from reaching

general form, which can be used with an arbitrary black-hole model, and then
visualised for the Kerr-Newman solution by plotting the ""admissible region"" in
the parameter space of critical particles, reproducing some known results and
obtaining a number of new ones. For example, we find that (marginally) bounded
critical particles with enormous values of angular momentum can, curiously
enough, approach the degenerate horizon, if the charge of the black hole is
very small. Such ""mega-BSW"" behaviour is excluded in the case of a vacuum black
hole, or a black hole with large charge. It may be interesting in connection

the spin and orbital scenarios of nematic phases, although the MEs show
anisotropic behaviors due to the C4 symmetry breaking induced by the nematic

accretion from a binary companion. A previously unrecognized factor governing

transient accretion. We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron
stars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases considering the drastic
variation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere
interaction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray
transients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can
persistent accretors, even when the spin down due to electromagnetic radiation
during quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the
equilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean
that no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each
outburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which
depends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than
that for persistent sources. This explains our numerical finding. This finding
implies that any meaningful study of neutron star spin and magnetic field
distributions requires the inclusion of the transient accretion effect, since
most accreting neutron star sources are transients. Our finding also implies
the existence of a submillisecond pulsar population, which is not observed.
This may point to the need for a competing spin-down mechanism for the
fastest-rotating accreting pulsars, such as gravitational radiation.

It is however challenging to build models that can give rise to NSI with
sizeable couplings discernible at neutrino oscillation experiments without
violating the various existing experimental bounds. We introduce two viable
models that can lead to neutral current NSI with sizable couplings. Both models
are based on a new $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry with $Z^\prime$ gauge boson of

verification results obtained with respect to the system and environment models

For autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments, safety of motion and
collision avoidance are critical requirements. With regard to these
requirements, Macek et al. [6] define the passive safety property, which
requires that no collision can occur while the autonomous system is moving. To
verify this property, we adopt a two phase process which combines static
verification methods, used at design time, with dynamic ones, used at run time.
In the design phase, we exploit UPPAAL to formalize the autonomous system and
its environment as timed automata and the safety property as TCTL formula and
to verify the correctness of these models with respect to this property. For
the runtime phase, we build a monitor to check whether the assumptions made at
design time are also correct at run time. If the current system observations of
the environment do not correspond to the initial system assumptions, the
monitor sends feedback to the system and the system enters a passive safe
state.

thermodynamic operation? Focusing on energy storage and batteries, we
demonstrate that quantum mechanics can lead to an enhancement in the amount of
work deposited per unit time, i.e., the charging power, when $N$ batteries are
charged collectively. We first derive analytic upper bounds for the collective
\emph{quantum advantage} in charging power for two choices of constraints on
the charging Hamiltonian. We then highlight the importance of entanglement by
proving that the quantum advantage vanishes when the collective state of the
batteries is restricted to be in the separable ball. Finally, we provide an
upper bound to the achievable quantum advantage when the interaction order is
restricted, i.e., at most $k$ batteries are interacting. Our result is a
fundamental limit on the advantage offered by quantum technologies over their
classical counterparts as far as energy deposition is concerned.

is strongly enhanced by applying a time-delayed weak near-infrared pulse. We
conclude that most of the valence electrons are removed from their atoms during
the laser-cluster interaction, and that electrons from the nanoplasma recombine
with ions and populate Rydberg states when the cluster expands, leading to a
\textit{decrease} of the average charge state of individual ions. Furthermore,
we find clear bound-state signatures in the electron kinetic energy spectrum,
which we attribute to Auger decay taking place in expanding clusters. Such
nonradiative processes lead to an \textit{increase} of the final average ion
charge state that is measured in experiments. Our results suggest that it is
crucial to include both recombination and nonradiative decay processes for the
understanding of recorded ion charge spectra.

1. Newly formed high mass stars and prestellar objects are identified and their
properties derived and compared. A study is also presented on five giant
molecular complexes at the further edge of the bar. The star-formation rate was
estimated from the quantity of proto-stars expected to form during the collapse
of massive turbulent clumps into star clusters. This new method was developed
by applying a Monte Carlo procedure to an evolutionary model of turbulent cores
and takes into account the wide multiplicity of sources produced during the
collapse. The star-formation rate density values at the tips are 1.2 +- 0.3
10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 and 1.5+-0.3 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 in the first and fourth

are 0.9+-0.2 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 and 0.8+-0.2 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2. The conversion
efficiency is approximately 0.8% in the first quadrant and 0.5% in the fourth
quadrant, and does not show a significant difference in proximity of the bar.
The star forming regions identified through CO contours at the further edge of
the bar show star-formation rate densities larger than the surrounding regions

star-formation activity at the bar is due to a large amount of dust and
molecular material rather than being due to a triggering process.

series. Our approach is based on an explicit representation of the

($L^2$-)approximation by a spectral density operator corresponding to a white
noise process. The estimation of this distance can be easily accomplished by
sums of periodogram kernels and it is shown that an appropriately standardized

hypothesis (of functional white noise) and under the alternative. As a
consequence we obtain a very simple test (using the quantiles of the normal
distribution) for the hypothesis of a white noise functional process. In
particular the test does neither require the estimation of a long run variance
(including a fourth order cumulant) nor resampling procedures to calculate
critical values. Moreover, in contrast to all other methods proposed in the
literature our approach also allows to test for ""relevant"" deviations from
white noise and to construct confidence intervals for a measure which measures
the discrepancy of the underlying process from a functional white noise

  In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the
heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines

allowed to probe them at levels where fluctuations are prominent, calling for
stochastic modeling in a large number of physical, chemical and biological
phenomena. This has provided fruitful applications for established stochastic
methods and motivated further developments. These systems often involve
processes taking place on widely separated time scales. For an efficient
modeling one usually focuses on the slower degrees of freedom and it is of
great importance to accurately eliminate the fast variables in a controlled
fashion, carefully accounting for their net effect on the slower dynamics. This
procedure in general requires to perform two different operations: decimation
and coarse-graining. We introduce the asymptotic methods that form the basis of
this procedure and discuss their application to a series of physical,
biological and chemical examples. We then turn our attention to functionals of
the stochastic trajectories such as residence times, counting statistics,
fluxes, entropy production, etc. which have been increasingly studied in recent
years. For such functionals, the elimination of the fast degrees of freedom can
present additional difficulties and naive procedures can lead to blatantly
inconsistent results. Homogenization techniques for functionals are less
covered in the literature and we will pedagogically present them here, as
natural extensions of the ones employed for the trajectories. We will also
discuss recent applications of these techniques to the thermodynamics of small
systems and their interpretation in terms of information-theoretic concepts.

networks in which nodes are entities and links are the relationships or
interactions between them. Typically this problem is confounded with the
problem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems
represent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.
However, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,
often from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to
connect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can
be more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For
instance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same
class label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class
labels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not
necessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network
(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe
links between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the
same genders in others. Performing classification in networks with different
types of heterogeneity is a hard problem that is made harder still when we do
not know a-priori the type or level of heterogeneity. Here we present two
scalable approaches for graph-based semi-supervised learning for the more
general case of relational networks. We demonstrate these approaches on
synthetic and real-world networks that display different link patterns within
and between classes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ours give better
classification performance without prior knowledge of how classes interact. In
particular, our two-step label propagation algorithm gives consistently good
accuracy and runs on networks of over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges in

explore some of these systematic uncertainties. We determined line abundances

changed the default input parameters of the different codes in a systematic way

there is no consensus on the correct values for many of these default

parameters that could alleviate the difference in abundances obtained by
different methods. In this work we provide quantitative estimates of
uncertainties in elemental abundances due to the effect of differing technical

from empirical commercial and industrial load data obtained from Texas.
Employing a dynamical system perspective, we show that price responsive demand
can be modeled as a hybrid of a Hammerstein model with delay following a price
surge, and a linear ARX model under moderate price changes. It is observed that
electricity consumption therefore has unique characteristics including (1)
qualitatively distinct response between moderate and extremely high prices; and
(2) a time delay associated with the response to high prices. It is shown that
these observed features may render traditional approaches to demand response
and retail pricing based on classical economic theories ineffective. In
particular, ultimate real-time retail pricing may be limitedly beneficial than
as considered in classical economic theories.

clusters and estimate the circumstances under which secondary star formation,
out of the reinserted winds from a first stellar generation (1G), is possible.
We have used two implementations of the model: a highly idealized
computationally inexpensive spherically symmetric semi-analytic model, and a
complex three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and they are in a
good mutual agreement. The results confirm our previous findings that in a
cluster with 1G mass $10^7$ M$_\odot$ and half-mass radius $2.38$ pc, the
shocked stellar winds become thermally unstable, collapse into dense gaseous
structures that partially accumulate inside the cluster, self-shield against
ionizing stellar radiation and form the second generation (2G) of stars. We
have used the semi-analytic model to explore a subset of the parameter space
covering a wide range of the observationally poorly constrained parameters: the
heating efficiency, $\eta_\mathrm{he}$, and the mass loading,
$\eta_\mathrm{ml}$. The results show that the fraction of the 1G stellar winds
accumulating inside the cluster can be larger than $50$ % if $\eta_\mathrm{he}
\lesssim 10$ % which is suggested by the observations. Furthermore, for low
$\eta_\mathrm{he}$, the model provides a self-consistent mechanism predicting
2G stars forming only in the central zones of the cluster. Finally, we have
calculated the accumulated warm gas emission in the H30$\alpha$ recombination
line, analyzed its velocity profile and estimated its intensity for super star
clusters in interacting galaxies NGC4038/9 (Antennae) showing that the warm gas
should be detectable with ALMA.

is overestimation of projected equatorial rotational velocity $V_{rot} \sin i$

infer posterior distributions of underlying hidden variables. However,
inference in implicit models or complex posterior distributions is hard. A
popular tool for learning implicit models are generative adversarial networks
(GANs) which learn parameters of generators by fooling discriminators.
Typically, GANs are considered to be models themselves and are not understood
in the context of inference. Current techniques rely on inefficient global
discrimination of joint distributions to perform learning, or only consider
discriminating a single output variable. We overcome these limitations by
treating GANs as a basis for likelihood-free inference in generative models and
generalize them to Bayesian posterior inference over factor graphs. We propose
local learning rules based on message passing minimizing a global divergence
criterion involving cooperating local adversaries used to sidestep explicit
likelihood evaluations. This allows us to compose models and yields a unified
inference and learning framework for adversarial learning. Our framework treats
model specification and inference separately and facilitates richly structured
models within the family of Directed Acyclic Graphs, including components such
as intractable likelihoods, non-differentiable models, simulators and generally
cumbersome models. A key result of our treatment is the insight that Bayesian
inference on structured models can be performed only with sampling and
discrimination when using nonparametric variational families, without access to
explicit distributions. As a side-result, we discuss the link to likelihood
maximization. These approaches hold promise to be useful in the toolbox of

hampered by the fact that its key object, the posterior probability
distribution, is often uncomputable. Expectation Propagation (EP) (Minka
(2001)) is a popular algorithm that solves this issue by computing a parametric
approximation (e.g: Gaussian) to the density of the posterior. However, while
it is known empirically to quickly compute fine approximations, EP is extremely
poorly understood which prevents it from being adopted by a larger fraction of
the community.
  The object of the present article is to shed intuitive light on EP, by
relating it to other better understood methods. More precisely, we link it to
using gradient descent to compute the Laplace approximation of a target
probability distribution. We show that EP is exactly equivalent to performing
gradient descent on a smoothed energy landscape: i.e: the original energy
landscape convoluted with some smoothing kernel. This also relates EP to
algorithms that compute the Gaussian approximation which minimizes the reverse
KL divergence to the target distribution, a link that has been conjectured
before but has not been proved rigorously yet. These results can help
practitioners to get a better feel for how EP works, as well as lead to other
new results on this important method.

of stars such as effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity (log
g). However, those photospheric characteristics are often hampered by
systematic uncertainties. The joint spectro-seismo project (APOKASC) of field
red giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the log g determined
spectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely
dependent on the stellar evolutionary status. Therefore, in this letter, we aim
to shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset using the APOKASC
sample. We analyse the log g discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and
evolutionary status and discuss the impact of He and carbon isotopic ratio.
  We first show that for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch, the
discrepancy between spectroscopic and asteroseismic log g depends on stellar
mass. This indicates that the discrepancy is related to CN cycling. We
demonstrate that the C isotopic ratio ($\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$) has the largest
impact on the stellar spectrum. We find that this log g discrepancy shows a
similar trend in mass as the $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios expected by stellar
evolution theory. Although we do not detect a direct signature of $\rm ^{13}C$,
the data suggests that the discrepancy is tightly correlated to the production
of $\rm ^{13}C$. Moreover, by running a data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a
synthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we quantitatively evaluate the
impact of various $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. While we have demonstrated that
$\rm ^{13}C$ impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the
observed offset in log g. If further tests confirm that $\rm ^{13}C$ is not the
main element responsible of the log g problem, the number of spectroscopic
effects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited. [Abridged]

inertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis force) in the convective
region of the stars. The dissipation of these waves plays a prominent role in
the long-term orbital and rotational evolution of the bodies involved. If the
primary star rotates as a solid body, inertial waves have a Doppler-shifted
frequency restricted to the range $[-2\Omega, 2\Omega]$ ($\Omega$ being the
angular velocity of the star), and they can propagate in the entire convective
region. However, turbulent convection can sustain differential rotation with an
equatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration that modifies the
frequency range and propagation domain of inertial waves and allows corotation
resonances for non-axisymmetric oscillations. In this work, we perform
numerical simulations of tidally excited inertial waves in a differentially
rotating convective envelope with a conical (or latitudinal) rotation profile.
The tidal forcing that we adopt contains spherical harmonics that correspond to
the case of a circular and coplanar orbit. We study the viscous dissipation of
the waves as a function of tidal frequency for various stellar masses and
differential rotation parameters, as well as its dependence on the turbulent
viscosity coefficient. We compare our results with previous studies assuming
solid-body rotation and point out the potential key role of corotation

electrical charge for the implementation of computational logic, additional
degrees of freedom such as spin and valley offer alternative avenues for the
encoding of information. In transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers,
where spin-valley locking is present, strong retention of valley chirality has
been reported for MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ while MoSe$_2$ shows anomalously
low valley polarisation retention. In this work, chiral selectivity of MoSe$_2$
cavity polaritons under helical excitation is reported with a polarisation
degree that can be controlled by the exciton-cavity detuning. In contrast to
the very low circular polarisation degrees seen in MoSe$_2$ exciton and trion
resonances, we observe a significant enhancement of up to 7 times when in the
polaritonic regime. Here, polaritons introduce a fast decay mechanism which
inhibits full valley pseudospin relaxation and thus allows for increased
retention of injected polarisation in the emitted light. A dynamical model
applicable to cavity-polaritons in any TMD semiconductor, reproduces the
detuning dependence through the incorporation of the cavity-modified exciton
relaxation, allowing an estimate of the spin relaxation time in MoSe$_2$ which
is an order of magnitude faster than those reported in other TMDs. The valley
addressable exciton-polaritons reported here offer robust valley polarised
states demonstrating the prospect of valleytronic devices based upon TMDs
embedded in photonic structures, with significant potential for
valley-dependent nonlinear polariton-polariton interactions.

(PFFRG) approach that can be applied to arbitrary Heisenberg models with spins
ranging from the quantum case $S=1/2$ to the classical limit

realized by implementing $M=2S$ copies of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom on each
lattice site. We confirm that even without explicitly projecting onto the
highest spin sector of the Hilbert space, ground states tend to select the
largest possible local spin magnitude. This justifies the average treatment of
the pseudo fermion constraint in previous spin-1/2 PFFRG studies. We apply this
method to the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb Heisenberg model with
nearest neighbor $J_1>0$ and second neighbor $J_2>0$ interactions. Mapping out
the phase diagram in the $J_2/J_1$-$S$ plane we find that upon increasing $S$
quantum fluctuations are rapidly decreasing. In particular, already at $S=1$ we
find no indication for a magnetically disordered phase. In the limit
$S\rightarrow\infty$, the known phase diagram of the classical system is
exactly reproduced. More generally, we prove that for $S\rightarrow\infty$ the

($L^2$) as a misfit function is known to suffer from cycle skipping. This
increases the risk of computing a local rather than the global minimum of the
misfit. In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric
($W_2$) as a new misfit function for FWI. The $W_2$ metric has been proved to
have many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to
noise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density
functions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of
rearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is
quadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into
nonnegative density functions is discussed. Unlike the $L^2$ norm, $W_2$
measures not only amplitude differences, but also global phase shifts, which
helps to avoid cycle skipping issues. In this work, we build on our earlier
method to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the
$W_2$ technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it
to seismic relevant 2D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP
models. We propose a new way of using the $W_2$ metric trace-by-trace in FWI
and compare it to global $W_2$ via the solution of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation.
With corresponding adjoint source, the velocity model can be updated using the
l-BFGS method. Numerical results show the effectiveness of $W_2$ for
alleviating cycle skipping issues and sensitivity to noise. Both mathematical
theory and numerical examples demonstrate that the quadratic Wasserstein metric
is a good candidate for a misfit function in seismic inversion.

space is an infinite-dimensional Fock space. In particular, instead of
considering the action of the permutation group on $n$ copies of that space, we
consider the action of the unitary group $U(n)$ on the creation operators of
the $n$ modes and define a natural generalization of the symmetric subspace as
the space of states invariant under unitaries in $U(n)$. Our first result is a
complete characterization of this subspace, which turns out to be spanned by a
family of generalized coherent states related to the special unitary group
$SU(p,q)$ of signature $(p,q)$. More precisely, this construction yields a
unitary representation of the noncompact simple real Lie group $SU(p,q)$. We
therefore find a dual unitary representation of the pair of groups $U(n)$ and
$SU(p,q)$ on an $n(p+q)$-mode Fock space.
  The (Gaussian) $SU(p,q)$ coherent states resolve the identity on the
symmetric subspace, which implies a Gaussian de Finetti theorem stating that
tracing over a few modes of a unitary-invariant state yields a state close to a
mixture of Gaussian states. As an application of this de Finetti theorem, we
show that the $n\times n$ upper-left submatrix of an $n\times n$ Haar-invariant

polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ equipped with a suitable
additional structure: a symplectic-Hodge basis of its first algebraic de Rham

over $\mathbf{Z}$ of relative dimension $2g^2 + g$ and that
$\mathcal{B}_g\otimes \mathbf{Z}[1/2]$ is representable by a smooth

description of the tangent bundle $T_{\mathcal{B}_g/\mathbf{Z}}$ in terms of
the cohomology of the universal abelian scheme over the moduli stack of

structural anomalies for low values of {\lambda} and for both the two values of

for pressure and radial distribution functions, whereas the temperatures where
anomalies occur are underestimated. Upon increasing the elongation, the RISM
theory still predicts the existence of anomalies; the latter are no longer

the $d^{\ast}$(2380) is a $\pi N\Delta$ resonance embedded in the $NN\pi\pi$
continuum some 80 MeV below the $\Delta\Delta$ threshold. In particular,
predictions are made for the branching ratios of the unobserved yet
$d^{\ast}(2380)\to NN\pi$ decays which are suppressed in a
purely-$\Delta\Delta$ dibaryon model. Comments are also made on a possible
connection of the ABC effect observed in the $pn\to d^{\ast}\to d\pi^0\pi^0$

While the total density has to be monotonic as function of gate, the last

lead to such an effect, by creating a competition between the involved bands

information processing, representing elementary transformations of quantum
states that are composed to form complex quantum circuits. The class of quantum
transformations can be extended by including transformations on quantum
operations, and transformations thereof, and so on up to the construction of a
potentially infinite hierarchy of transformations. In the last decade, a
sub-hierarchy, known as quantum combs, was exhaustively studied, and
characterised as the most general class of transformations that can be achieved
by quantum circuits with open slots hosting variable input elements, to form a
complete output quantum circuit. The theory of quantum combs proved to be
successful for the optimisation of information processing tasks otherwise
untreatable. In more recent years the study of maps from combs to combs has
increased, thanks to interesting examples showing how this next order of maps
requires entanglement of the causal order of operations with the state of a
control quantum system, or, even more radically, superpositions of alternate
causal orderings. Some of these non-circuital transformations are known to be
achievable and have even been achieved experimentally, and were proved to
provide some computational advantage in various information-processing tasks
with respect to quantum combs. Here we provide a formal language to form all
possible types of transformations, and use it to prove general structure
theorems for transformations in the hierarchy. We then provide a mathematical
characterisation of the set of maps from combs to combs, hinting at a route for
the complete characterisation of maps in the hierarchy. The classification is
strictly related to the way in which the maps manipulate the causal structure
of input circuits.

formula have been widely used to calculate lattice thermal conductivities.
Previous studies, however, focused primarily on the calculated thermal
conductivities, with the uncertainty of the thermal conductivities remaining
poorly understood. In this paper, we study the quantification of the
uncertainty by using solid argon, silicon, and germanium as model material
systems, and examine the origin of the observed uncertainty. We find that the
uncertainty increases with the upper limit of the correlation time,
$t_{\text{corre, UL}}$, and decreases with the total simulation time,
$t_{\text{total}}$, whereas the velocity initialization seed, simulation domain
size, temperature, and type of material have minimal effects. The relative
uncertainties of the thermal conductivities for solid argon, silicon, and
germanium under different simulation conditions all follow a similar trend,
which can be fit with a ""universal"" square-root relation, as
$\sigma_{k_x}/k_{x, \text{ave}} = 2(t_{\text{total}}/t_{\text{corre,
UL}})^{-0.5}$. We have also conducted statistical analysis of the EMD-predicted
thermal conductivities and derived a formula that correlates the relative error
bound ($Q$), confidence level ($P$), $t_{\text{corre, UL}}$,
$t_{\text{total}}$, and number of independent simulations ($N$). We recommend
choosing $t_{\text{corre, UL}}$ to be 5-10 times the effective phonon
relaxation time, $\tau_{\text{eff}}$, and choosing $t_{\text{total}}$ and $N$
based on the desired relative error bound and confidence level. This study
provides new insights into understanding the uncertainty of EMD-predicted
thermal conductivities. It also provides a guideline for running EMD
simulations to achieve a desired relative error bound with a desired confidence
level and for reporting EMD-predicted thermal conductivities.

applications in many areas. CEP systems collect events arriving from input data
streams and use them to infer more complex events according to predefined
patterns. The Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is one of the most
popular mechanisms on which such systems are based. During the event detection
process, NFAs incrementally extend previously observed partial matches until a
full match for the query is found. As a result, each arriving event needs to be
processed to determine whether a new partial match is to be initiated or an
existing one extended. This method may be highly inefficient when many of the
events do not result in output matches. We present a lazy evaluation mechanism
that defers processing of frequent event types and stores them internally upon
arrival. Events are then matched in ascending order of frequency, thus
minimizing potentially redundant computations. We introduce a Lazy Chain NFA,
which utilizes the above principle, and does not depend on the underlying
pattern structure. An algorithm for constructing a Lazy Chain NFA for common
pattern types is presented, including conjunction, negation and iteration.
Finally, we experimentally evaluate our mechanism on real-world stock trading
data. The results demonstrate a performance gain of two orders of magnitude
over traditional NFA-based approaches, with significantly reduced memory
resource requirements.

minimization of information leakage. The method is based on a Model Predictive
Controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts
the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption

solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program of manageable size whenever new meter

reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that

which have so far proved elusive to experimental efforts. In this article, we
study the thermodynamic, spectral and transport signatures of quantum
criticality and Kondo physics of a dilute ensemble of atomic impurities in
graphene. We consider vacancies and adatoms that either break or preserve
graphene's $C_{3v}$ and inversion symmetries. In a neutral graphene sample, all
cases display symmetry-dependent quantum criticality, leading to enhanced
impurity scattering for asymmetric impurities, in a manner analogous to
bound-state formation by nonmagnetic resonant scatterers. Kondo correlations
emerge only in the presence of a back gate, with estimated Kondo temperatures
well within the experimentally accessible domain for all impurity types. For
symmetry-breaking impurities at charge neutrality, quantum criticality is
signaled by $T^{-2}$ resistivity scaling, leading to full insulating behavior
at low temperatures, while low-temperature resistivity plateaus appear both in
the non-critical and Kondo regimes. By contrast, the resitivity contribution
from symmetric vacancies and hollow-site adsorbates vanishes at charge
neutrality and for arbitrary back gate voltages, respectively. This implies
that local probing methods are required for the detection of both Kondo and
quantum critical signatures in these symmetry-preserving cases.

outer halos around galaxies is now often used to probe their past mass
assembly. Because the extended halos survive longer than the relatively fragile
tidal features, they trace more ancient mergers. We use images reaching surface
brightness limits as low as 28.5-29 mag.arcsec-2 (g-band) to obtain light and
color profiles up to 5-10 effective radii of a sample of nearby early-type
galaxies. They were acquired with MegaCam as part of the CFHT MATLAS large
programme. These profiles may be compared to those produced by simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution, once corrected for instrumental effects. Indeed
they can be heavily contaminated by the scattered light caused by internal
reflections within the instrument. In particular, the nucleus of galaxies
generates artificial flux in the outer halo, which has to be precisely
subtracted. We present a deconvolution technique to remove the artificial halos
that makes use of very large kernels. The technique based on PyOperators is
more time efficient than the model-convolution methods also used for that
purpose. This is especially the case for galaxies with complex structures that
are hard to model. Having a good knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF),
including its outer wings, is critical for the method. A database of MegaCam
PSF models corresponding to different seeing conditions and bands was generated
directly from the deep images. It is shown that the difference in the PSFs in
different bands causes artificial changes in the color profiles, in particular
a reddening of the outskirts of galaxies having a bright nucleus. The method is
validated with a set of simulated images and applied to three representative
test cases: NGC 3599, NGC 3489, and NGC 4274, and exhibiting for two of them a
prominent ghost halo. The method successfully removes it.

important contribution to neutrino-nucleus interactions, ranging from
intermediate to high energies. There exists a good number of low-energy models
in the literature to describe the neutrinoproduction of pions in the region
around the Delta resonance. Those models consider only lowest-order interaction
terms and, therefore, fail in the high-energy region (pion-nucleon invariant
masses, $W$>2 GeV).
  [Purpose] Our goal is to develop a model for electroweak SPP off the nucleon,
which is applicable to the entire energy range of interest for present and
future neutrino-oscillation experiments.
  [Method] We start with the low-energy model of [Phys.Rev.D76,033005(2007)],
which includes resonant contributions and background terms derived from the
pion-nucleon Lagrangian of chiral-perturbation theory. Then, from the
background contributions, we build a high-energy model using a Regge approach.
The low- and high-energy models are combined, in a phenomenological way, into a
hybrid model.
  [Results] The Hybrid model is identical to the low-energy model in the low-W
region, but, for W>2 GeV, it implements the desired high-energy behavior
dictated by Regge theory. We have tested the high-energy model by comparing
with one-pion production data from electron and neutrino reactions. The Hybrid
model is compared with electron-proton scattering data, with neutrino SPP data
and with the predictions of the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator.
  [Conclusions] Our model is able to provide satisfactory predictions of the
electroweak one-pion production cross section from pion threshold to high $W$.
Further investigation and more data are needed to better understand the
mechanisms playing a role in the electroweak SPP process in the high-W region,
in particular, those involving the axial current contributions.

(aphysical) data due to noisy observations, and a method for combining frames
of a moving vehicle into a single image. The proposed approaches are used to
show improvement in both imaging (useful for human-in-the-loop target
recognition) and automatic target recognition in a measured data set.

millions of people worldwide. Lately, there has been considerable interest in
systems for at-home monitoring of patients, using wearable devices which
contain inertial measurement units. We present a new wavelet-based approach for
analysis of data from single wrist-worn smart-watches, and show high detection
performance for tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia, which have been the major
targets for monitoring in this context. We also discuss the implication of our
controlled-experiment results for uncontrolled home monitoring of freely
behaving patients.

generating temporal networks representing the influence between published
articles. In this article we propose a methodology based on the application of
natural language analysis of the articles to reconstruct the spread network.
From the reconstructed network, we show that the dynamics of the news spread
can be approximated by a classical SIR epidemiological dynamics upon the
network. From the results obtained we argue that the methodology proposed can
be used to make predictions about media repercussion, and also to detect viral
memes in news streams.

utilization. Current network scenario is experiencing the huge spectrum
scarcity problem due to the fixed assignment policy so in this method great
amount of spectrum remain unused. To overcome this limitation the spectrum
allocation must be in dynamic manner. In this paper the spectrum allocation is
discussed thoroughly. Interference is the most important factor that needs to
be considered. It is caused by the environment (noise) or by other radio users.
It limits the possibility of spectrum reuse. Channel assignment is one of the
techniques used to control interference in the network. There exist a trade-off
between network capacity and level of contention. In cognitive radio networks
spectrum assignment or spectrum allocation or frequency assignment is used to
avoid interference. It is the process of simultaneous selection of operating
central frequency and bandwidth. In doing so, the process of sensing the
spectrum becomes very crucial; it must be reliable, accurate and efficient. The
accuracy of sensing affects the overall operation of cognitive networks.
Accurate results not only lead to higher utilization of the spectrum but also
preserve the privacy of primary user. Accuracy of sensing is highly affected by
the natural causes like noise, shadowing, fading etc. There are many other
challenges as well, like, hardware requirements, hidden node problem, security,
sensing frequency and duration, decision fusion etc.
