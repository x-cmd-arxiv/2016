software. Software becomes responsible for most of the critical functions of
systems. Many different safety analysis techniques have been developed to
identify hazards of systems. FTA and FMEA are most commonly used by safety
analysts. Recently, STPA has been proposed with the goal to better cope with
complex systems including software. Objective: This research aimed at comparing
quantitatively these three safety analysis techniques with regard to their
effectiveness, applicability, understandability, ease of use and efficiency in
identifying software safety requirements at the system level. Method: We
conducted a controlled experiment with 21 master and bachelor students applying
these three techniques to three safety-critical systems: train door control,
anti-lock braking and traffic collision and avoidance. Results: The results
showed that there is no statistically significant difference between these
techniques in terms of applicability, understandability and ease of use, but a
significant difference in terms of effectiveness and efficiency is obtained.
Conclusion: We conclude that STPA seems to be an effective method to identify
software safety requirements at the system level. In particular, STPA addresses
more different software safety requirements than the traditional techniques FTA
and FMEA, but STPA needs more time to carry out by safety analysts with little
or no prior experience.

the high frequencies is sufficient to recover the uniform observability.
Unfortunately, this remedy needs to compute all the frequencies of the
underlying system. In this paper we present three cheaper alternative remedies,
namely a spectral filtering, a mixed formulation and Nitsche's method to append
Dirichlet type boundary conditions. Our numerical results show indeed that
uniform boundary observability inequalities may be recovered. On another hand,
surprisingly, none of them seems to provide a uniform direct (or trace)

set of quantum optical models; Dicke, Tavis-Cummings, quantum Rabi, and finally
the Jaynes-Cummings model. As the light-matter coupling is increased into the
deep strong coupling regime, the ground state turns from vacuum to become a
superradiant state characterized by both atomic and photonic excitations. It is
pointed out that all four transitions are of the mean-field type, that quantum
fluctuations are negligible, and hence these fluctuations cannot be responsible
for the corresponding vacuum instability. In this respect, these are not
quantum phase transitions. In the case of the Tavis-Cummings and
Jaynes-Cummings models, the continuous symmetry of these models implies that
quantum fluctuations are not only negligible, but strictly zero. However, all
models possess a non-analyticity in the ground state in agreement with a
continuous quantum phase transition. As such, it is a matter of taste whether
the transitions should be termed quantum or not. In addition, we also consider
the modifications of the transitions when photon losses are present. For the
Dicke and Rabi models these non-equilibrium steady states remain critical,
while the criticality for the open Tavis-Cummings and Jaynes-Cummings models is
completely lost, i.e. in realistic settings one cannot expect a true critical
behaviour for the two last models.

challenges, including accounting for unknown planet radius and uncertain
stellar illumination phase angle. Here we report on our continued development
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo retrieval methods for addressing these issues in
the interpretation of such data. Specifically we explore how the unknown planet
radius and potentially poorly known observer-planet-star phase angle impacts
retrievals of parameters of interest such as atmospheric methane abundance,
cloud properties and surface gravity. As expected, the uncertainty in retrieved
values is a strong function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the observed
spectra, particularly for low metallicity atmospheres, which lack deep
absorption signatures. Meaningful results may only be possible above certain
SNR thresholds; for cases across a metallicity range of 1-50 times solar, we
find that only an SNR of 20 systematically reproduces close to the correct
methane abundance at all phase angles. However, even in cases where the phase
angle is poorly known we find that the planet radius can be constrained to
within a factor of two. We find that uncertainty in planet radius decreases at
phase angles past quadrature, as the highly forward scattering nature of the
atmosphere at these geometries limits the possible volume of phase space that
relevant parameters can occupy. Finally, we present an estimation of possible
improvement that can result from combining retrievals against observations at
multiple phase angles.

an orientation-lifted Finsler metric and the Euler elastica curve. The original
minimal path model computes the globally minimal geodesic by solving an Eikonal
partial differential equation (PDE). Essentially, this first-order model is
unable to penalize curvature which is related to the path rigidity property in
the classical active contour models. To solve this problem, we present an
Eikonal PDE-based Finsler elastica minimal path approach to address the
curvature-penalized geodesic energy minimization problem. We were successful at
adding the curvature penalization to the classical geodesic energy. The basic
idea of this work is to interpret the Euler elastica bending energy via a novel
Finsler elastica metric that embeds a curvature penalty. This metric is
non-Riemannian, anisotropic and asymmetric, and is defined over an
orientation-lifted space by adding to the image domain the orientation as an
extra space dimension. Based on this orientation lifting, the proposed minimal
path model can benefit from both the curvature and orientation of the paths.
Thanks to the fast marching method, the global minimum of the
curvature-penalized geodesic energy can be computed efficiently. We introduce
two anisotropic image data-driven speed functions that are computed by
steerable filters. Based on these orientation-dependent speed functions, we can
apply the proposed Finsler elastica minimal path model to the applications of
closed contour detection, perceptual grouping and tubular structure extraction.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that these
applications of the proposed model indeed obtain promising results.

allowing for a change of the supersymmetry-preserving features of
electromagnetic charge configurations supporting the black hole solution, thus
switching from one U-duality orbit to another, or - equivalently - from an

another one. On the supergravity side of BHQC, such quantum gates relate to
particular symplectic transformations acting on the black hole charges; namely,
such transformations cannot belong to the U-duality group, otherwise switching
among orbits would be impossible. In this paper, we consider a particular class
of such symplectic transformations, namely the ones belonging to the so-called
Peccei-Quinn symplectic group, introduced some time ago within the study of
very special Kaehler geometries of the vector multiplets' scalar manifolds in N

the observational constraints for this model. Next, in the framework of HDE, we
discuss various topics, such as spatial curvature, neutrino, instability of

big rip singularity. In addition, from both the theoretical and the
observational aspects, we introduce the interacting holographic dark energy
scenario, where the interaction between dark matter and HDE is taken into
account. Furthermore, we discuss the HDE scenario in various modified gravity
(MG) theories, such as Brans-Dicke theory, braneworld theory, scalar-tensor

of reconstructing various scalar-field DE and MG models from HDE. Moreover, we
introduce other DE models inspired by the HP, in which different characteristic
length scales are chosen. Finally, we make comparisons among various

occurring inside optical fibers. The propagation of light in single-mode fibers
is governed by the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLS) in
the presence of attenuation, dispersion, and non linear effects. In this NLS
the role of space and time is exchanged with respect to the standard NLS as
introduced in the almost entire mathematical literature. Such an exchange is
far from being only formal as it enters in the interpretation of basic ideas as
well-posedness and stability, as well as in the phenomenological meaning of the
predictions formulated by such model. In this dissertation, the physical bases
of the optical fibers are provided, and a derivation of the NLS from the
Maxwell's equations is reviewed. Furthermore, problems of local nature (local
existence of solutions, uniqueness) and problems of global nature (global
existence) are studied by the Kato's method based on a fixed point argument and
Strichartz's estimates. Moreover, tools usually employed to study global
problems connected with finite-time blow up of solutions, are here used to show
a closeness result between the NLS for optical fibers and an integrable NLS.
Integrability is pursued by means of the Painlev\'e analysis that allows to
describe quite a large class of integrable equations like the transformed
equation from the standard NLS. Among these functions, one can be described as
a standard NLS with an additional linear harmonic oscillator term. This
equation is showed to be close in $L^2$-norm to the NLS for single-mode fibers.
Finally, the dissertation focuses on two kinds of stationary solutions: the
so-called time-homogenous, that is given by a stationary wave oscillating in
space, and the soliton-like solution. Results are obtained about stability
properties of them.

growth remains a grand challenge. The underlying phase transitions and
dynamical processes in deeply supercooled systems are often rendered
inaccessible due to limitations imposed by system sizes and timescales, which
is further compounded by their sluggish kinetics. Here, we introduce a
machine-learned, bond-order-based potential model (BOP) that more accurately
describes the anomalous behavior, as well as structural and thermodynamical
properties of both liquid water and ice, with at least two orders of magnitude
cheaper computational cost than existing atomistic water models. In a
significant departure from conventional force-field fitting, we use a
multilevel evolutionary strategy that trains the BOP model against not just
energetics but temperature dependent properties inferred from on-the-fly
molecular dynamics simulations as well. We use the BOP model to probe the
homogeneous ice nucleation and growth process by performing molecular dynamics
on multi-million molecule systems for up to microsecond time scales. These
massively parallel, long-time simulations naturally capture the competition
between cubic, hexagonal, and stacking disordered ice phases during nucleation
and early stages of growth leading to the formation of nanometer sized grains.
Subsequently, we elucidate the hitherto elusive mechanism of grain coarsening
of the crystallized mixed ice phases, which occur through grain dissolution and
Ostwald ripening followed by grain boundary migration.

absorption features in the two massive early-type galaxies NGC 1277 and IC 843.
Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field SpecTrogaph (SWIFT), we obtain
resolved measurements of the NaI0.82 and FeH0.99 indices, among others, finding
both galaxies show strong gradients in NaI absorption combined with flat FeH
profiles at $\sim0.4$\AA. We find these measurements may be explained by radial
gradients in the IMF, appropriate abundance gradients in [Na/Fe] and [Fe/H], or
a combination of the two, and our data is unable to break this degeneracy. We
also use full spectral fitting to infer global properties from an integrated
spectrum of each object, deriving a unimodal IMF slope consistent with Salpeter
in IC 843 ($x=2.27\pm0.17$) but steeper than Salpeter in NGC 1277
($x=2.69\pm0.11$), despite their similar FeH equivalent widths. Independently,
we fit the strength of the FeH feature and compare to the E-MILES and CvD12
stellar population libraries, finding agreement between the models. The IMF
values derived in this way are in close agreement with those from spectral
fitting in NGC 1277 ($x_{\mathrm{CvD}}=2.59^{+0.25}_{-0.48}$ ,
$x_{\mathrm{E-MILES}}=2.77\pm0.31$), but are less consistent in IC 843, with
the IMF derived from FeH alone leading to steeper slopes than when fitting the
full spectrum ($x_{\mathrm{CvD}}=2.57^{+0.30}_{-0.41}$,
$x_{\mathrm{E-MILES}}=2.72\pm0.25$). This work highlights the importance of a
large wavelength coverage for breaking the degeneracy between abundance and IMF
variations, and may bring into doubt the use of the Wing-Ford band as an IMF
index if used without other spectral information.

exist in antiferromagnets, which carry opposite magnetic moments. Consequently,
and in contrast to ferromagnets, Bose-Einstein condensation can occur for
either sign of the spin accumulation. This condensation may occur even at room

  In the first step one associates to any Poisson (resp. Lie bialgebra)
structure a so called quantizable Poisson (resp. Lie bialgebra) structure. We
show explicit transcendental formulae for this correspondence.
  In the second step one deformation quantizes a quantizable Poisson (resp. Lie

second step correspondence (as a byproduct we obtain configuration space models
for biassociahedron and bipermutohedron).
  In the Poisson case the first step is the most non-trivial one and requires a
choice of an associator while the second step quantization is essentially
unique, it is independent of a choice of an associator and can be done by a
trivial induction. We conjecture that similar statements hold true in the case
of Lie bialgebras.
  The main new result is a surprisingly simple explicit universal formula

correlate well with human assessments of quality. Standard syntactic evaluation

newer SPICE and CIDEr metrics are better correlated, but have traditionally
been hard to optimize for. In this paper, we show how to use a policy gradient
(PG) method to directly optimize a linear combination of SPICE and CIDEr (a
combination we call SPIDEr): the SPICE score ensures our captions are
semantically faithful to the image, while CIDEr score ensures our captions are
syntactically fluent. The PG method we propose improves on the prior MIXER
approach, by using Monte Carlo rollouts instead of mixing MLE training with PG.
We show empirically that our algorithm leads to easier optimization and
improved results compared to MIXER. Finally, we show that using our PG method
we can optimize any of the metrics, including the proposed SPIDEr metric which
results in image captions that are strongly preferred by human raters compared
to captions generated by the same model but trained to optimize MLE or the COCO

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliobov (HFB) framework while for the odd-mass ones the Equal
Filling Approximation (HFB-EFA) has been employed. Ground state quantum numbers
and deformations, pairing energies, one-neutron separation energies, inner and
outer barrier heights as well as fission isomer excitation energies are given.
Fission paths, collective masses and zero-point quantum vibrational and
rotational corrections are used to compute the systematic of the spontaneous
fission half-lives t$_\mathrm{SF}$ both for even-even and odd-mass nuclei.
Though there exists a strong variance of the predicted fission rates with
respect to the details involved in their computation, it is shown that both the
specialization energy and the pairing quenching effects, taken into account
within the self-consistent HFB-EFA blocking procedure, lead to larger
t$_\mathrm{SF}$ values in odd-mass nuclei as compared with their even-even

parametrization of the Viola-Seaborg formula. The high quality of the Gogny-D1M

hydrodynamics, which provides effective descriptions of the density and
velocity fields in gapless quantum gases. We show that the information content
of the large time steady state is inherently connected to the presence of
ballistically moving localised excitations. When such excitations are present,
the system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus
evading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the
Luttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum
KdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial
correlations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large
times, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics. However nonlinear
dispersion or interactions, when separately present, lead to spreading and
delocalisation that suppress the above effect by eliminating the memory of
non-Gaussian correlations. We show that, for any initial state that satisfies
sufficient clustering of correlations, the steady state is Gaussian in terms of
the bosonised or fermionised fields in the dispersive or interacting case
respectively. On the other hand, when dispersion and interaction are
simultaneously present, a semiclassical approximation suggests that
localisation is restored as the two effects compensate each other and solitary
waves are formed. Solitary waves, or simply solitons, are experimentally
observed in quantum gases and theoretically predicted based on semiclassical
approaches, but the question of their stability at the quantum level remains to
a large extent an open problem. We give a general overview on the subject and
discuss the relevance of our findings to general out of equilibrium problems.

rheological behavior from the microscopic structure is difficult, but important
for materials science. Here, we consider colloidal suspensions and propose to
supplement the static structural information with the local dynamics, namely
the rearrangement and breaking of the cage of neighbors. This is quantified by
the mean squared nonaffine displacement and the number of particles that remain
nearest neighbors for a long time, i.e. long-lived neighbors, respectively.
Both quantities are followed under shear using confocal microscopy and are the
basis to calculate the affine and nonaffine contributions to the elastic
stress, which is complemented by the viscous stress to give the total stress.
During start-up of shear, the model predicts three transient regimes that
result from the interplay of affine, nonaffine and viscous contributions. Our
prediction quantitatively agrees with rheological data and their dependencies
on volume fraction and shear rate.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letters",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slw244",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) the Rapid Burster (RB; MXB
1730-335) uniquely shows both Type-I and Type-II X-ray bursts. The origin of
the latter is ill-understood but has been linked to magnetospheric gating of
the accretion flow. We present a spectral analysis of simultaneous Swift,
NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the RB during its 2015 outburst. Although
a broad Fe-K line has been observed before, the high quality of our
observations allows us to model this line using relativistic reflection models
for the first time. We find that the disk is strongly truncated at
$41.8^{+6.7}_{-5.3}$ gravitational radii ($\sim 87$ km), which supports
magnetospheric Type-II burst models and strongly disfavors models involving
instabilities at the innermost stable circular orbit. Assuming that the RB
magnetic field indeed truncates the disk, we find $B = (6.2 \pm 1.5) \times
10^8$ G, larger than typically inferred for NS LMXBs. In addition, we find a
low inclination ($i = 29\pm2^{\rm o}$). Finally, we comment on the origin of
the Comptonized and thermal components in the RB spectrum.

well-segmented sequences which have been edited to remove noisy or irrelevant

Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which integrates ideas from attention models and
gated recurrent networks to better deal with noisy or unsegmented sequences.
Specifically, we extend the concept of attention model to measure the relevance
of each observation (time step) of a sequence. We then use a novel gated
recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the final prediction.
An important advantage of our approach is interpretability since the temporal
attention weights provide a meaningful value for the salience of each time step
in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our TAGM approach, both for
prediction accuracy and interpretability, on three different tasks: spoken
digit recognition, text-based sentiment analysis and visual event recognition.

order, ghost-free field equations, this theory represents a minimal setup in
which higher-order gravitational couplings in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter
(AdS) spaces, including black holes, can be solved analytically. This however
has an obvious limitation as in dimensions lower than seven, the contribution
from cubic or higher curvature terms is merely topological. Therefore, in order
to go beyond quadratic order and study higher terms in AdS_5 analytically, one
is compelled to look for other toy models. One such model is the so-called
quasi-topological gravity, which, despite being a higher-derivative theory,
provides a tractable setup with R^3 and R^4 terms. In this paper, we
investigate AdS_5 black holes in quasi-topological gravity. We consider the
theory conformally coupled to matter and in presence of Abelian gauge fields.
We show that charged black holes in AdS_5 which, in addition, exhibit a
backreaction of the matter fields on the geometry can be found explicitly in
this theory. These solutions generalize the black hole solution of
quasi-topological gravity and exist in a region of the parameter spaces
consistent with the constraints coming from causality and other consistency
conditions. They have finite conserved charges and exhibit non-trivial
thermodynamical properties.

how resistance manifests is essential to enable optimisation of dosing regimens

through introduction of a novel model of the dynamics of the parasites'
response to drug, we explore how artemisinin-based therapies may be adjusted to
maintain efficacy and how artemisinin resistance may manifest and be overcome.
We introduce a dynamic mathematical model, extending on the traditional
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic framework, to capture the time-dependent
development of a stress response in parasites. We fit the model to in vitro
data and establish that the parasites' stress response explains the recently
identified complex interplay between drug concentration, exposure time and
parasite viability. Our model demonstrates that the previously reported
hypersensitivity of early ring stage parasites of the 3D7 strain to
dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is primarily due to the rapid development of stress,
rather than any change in the maximum achievable killing rate. Of direct
clinical relevance, we demonstrate that the complex temporal features of
artemisinin action observed in vitro have a significant impact on predictions
of in vivo parasite clearance using PK-PD models. Given the important role that
such models play in the design and evaluation of clinical trials for
alternative drug dosing regimens, our model contributes an enhanced predictive
platform for the continued efforts to minimise the burden of malaria.

eruption (in 1901), and two more dwarf nova events (in 1973 and 1991). Previous
work on this bright system in quiescence (V=13.5) has only been a few isolated
magnitudes, a few spectra, and an ambiguous claim for an orbital period of
5.714 days as based on nine radial velocities. To test this period, we have
collected 2896 magnitudes (plus 53 in the literature) in the UBVRIJHKL bands
from 1897 to 2016, making an essentially complete photometric history of this
unique cataclysmic variable. We find that the light curve in all bands is
dominated by the ellipsoidal modulations of a G giant companion star, with a
post-eruption (after the 1919 nova event) orbital period of 5.786290 +-
0.000032 days. This is the longest period for any classical nova, the accretion
must be powered by the nuclear evolution of the companion star, and the dwarf
nova events occur only because the outer parts of the large disk are cool
enough to be unstable. Furthermore, we measure the pre-eruption orbital period
(from 1907 to 1916), and there is a small steady period change in quiescence.
The orbital period has decreased by 273 +- 61 parts-per-million across the 1919
eruption, with the significance of the period change being at the 5.7-sigma
confidence level. This is startling and mystifying for nova-theory, because the
three known period change effects cannot account for a period decrease in V1017
Sgr, much less one of such a large size.

that excluding a pure CP-odd coupling hypothesis requires $\mathcal{O}(400

angular resolution of the neutral pion momenta does not constitute a
significant hurdle. Achieving a signal to background ratio ($S/B$) close to
one, while keeping a high enough signal yield required to study the angular
distributions selects out VBF as a promising mode to probe the CP nature of the
$h\tau\tau$ coupling, with gluon fusion suffering from a low $S/B$, and the
$W^\pm h/Zh$ mode (with leptonically decaying $W^\pm /Z$) having a much smaller

Small grains (less than 50 carbon atoms) should be fully aromatized in the
general interstellar medium. If larger grains initially have an aliphatic
structure, it is preserved to a substantial extent. Variations in the size
distribution of the grains due to their mutual collisions depend appreciably on
the adopted initial size distribution. For the MRN initial distribution a
significant redistribution of grain sizes is obtained, which increases the mass
fraction of smaller grains. Characteristic for an initial distribution from the
work of Jones et al. (2013), with high initial fraction of small grains, is a
general decrease in the number of grains of all sizes.

distributions of interstellar dust grains, driven by their destruction by
radiation, collisions with gas particles, and shattering due to grain-grain
collisions. Based on these calculations we model dust emission spectra. The
initial grain size distribution play the important role in the evolution of an
ensemble of dust particles. Radiation in the considered intensity range mostly
aromatizes grains. The smallest grains are mainly destructed via sputtering by
collisions with gas particles. There are no grains smaller than 20~\AA\ in the
medium at relative gas-dust velocities more than 50~km/s, which is typical for
shocks in supernova remnants. The IR emission spectrum changes significantly
due to the dust evolution depending on the adopted grain properties, in
particular, on the energy of the C--C bonds ($E_0$). Aromatic bands in the
near-IR (2--15~$\mu$m) are absent, if $E_0$ is low, even when the medium
properties correspond to the average interstellar medium in our Galaxy. As in
reality these bands are observed, high $E_0$ values are more preferable. We
consider dependence of the emission intensity ratios for various photometric
bands on the medium properties. The aromatization degree of small grains shows
up most strongly in the $I_{3.4}/I_{11.3}$ intensity ratio while the fraction
of aromatic grains in the total dust mass influences the $I_{3.3}/I_{70+160}$
ratio.

response, and thermal expansion at finite temperatures are computed and
compared to experimental data. We also compute cohesive energies explicitly

accurate description of thermal properties and retains a level of
transferability and accuracy that is comparable to or better than some of the
best constraint-based semi-local functionals. Especially, with regard to the
cohesive energies the consistent inclusion of spin polarization effects in the

require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks
are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive
amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL
agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the
world around it, even while deployed. However, this learning requires access to
a reward function, which is often hard to measure in real-world domains, where
the reward could depend on, for example, unknown positions of objects or the
emotional state of the user. Conversely, it is often quite practical to provide
the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a
human supervisor is present or in a controlled setting. Can we make use of this
limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent
might collect on its own? In this paper, we formalize this problem as
semisupervised reinforcement learning, where the reward function can only be
evaluated in a set of ""labeled"" MDPs, and the agent must generalize its
behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of ""unlabeled""
MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the
task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles
inverse RL, using the agent's own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a
kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on
challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our

distribution (based on counts of CMEs, coronal jets, and spicules), suggesting
that many or most spicules could result from microfilament eruptions. Observed
spicule-base Ca II brightenings plausibly result from such microfilament
eruptions. By analogy with coronal jets, microfilament eruptions might produce
spicules with many of their observed characteristics, including smooth rise
profiles, twisting motions, and EUV counterparts. The postulated microfilament

blocking duality is an analogue on networks to the method of conjugate families
of curves in the plane. The technique presented here leads to a general
framework for studying families of objects on networks; each such family has a
corresponding dual family whose $p$-modulus is essentially the reciprocal of
the original family's. As an application, we give a modulus-based proof for the
fact that effective resistance is a metric on graphs. This proof immediately
generalizes to yield a family of graph metrics, depending on the parameter $p$,
that continuously interpolates among the shortest-path metric, the effective
resistance metric, and the mincut ultrametric. In a second application, we
establish a connection between Fulkerson's blocking duality and the
probabilistic interpretation of modulus. This connection, in turn, provides a
straightforward proof of several monotonicity properties of modulus that
generalize known monotonicity properties of effective resistance. Finally, we
use this framework to expand on a result of Lov\'asz in the context of randomly
weighted graphs.

these arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a
quantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet
mass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer
simulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in
disks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\delta_{\rm
max}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio
($h/r$): $\delta_{\rm max}\approx((M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.
With current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum
planet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\odot$
star at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more
massive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in
observed disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates
from a different planet. We also find only massive perturbers with at least
multi-Jupiter masses are capable of driving bright arms with $\delta_{\rm
max}\gtrsim2$ as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkH$\alpha$~330, and these
arms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find the
morphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely
unaffected by a modest level of viscosity with $\alpha\lesssim0.01$. Finally,
the contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO

homogeneously selected galaxies with IFU AO-aided observations -- the `SHiZELS'
survey, with roughly equal number of galaxies per redshift slice, at $z$ = 0.8,
1.47, and 2.23. We measure the dynamics and identify the major kinematic axis
by modelling their velocity fields to extract rotational curves and infer their
inclination-corrected rotational velocities. We explore the stellar mass
Tully-Fisher relationship, finding that galaxies with higher velocity
dispersions tend to deviate from this relation. Using kinemetry analyses we
find that galaxy interactions might be the dominant mechanism controlling the
star-formation activity at $z$ = 2.23 but they become gradually less important
down to $z$ = 0.8. Metallicity gradients derived from the [NII]/H$\alpha$
emission line ratio show a median negative gradient for the SHiZELS survey of
$\Delta$log(O/H)/$\Delta$R = -0.026$\pm$0.008 dex kpc$^{-1}$. We find that
metal-rich galaxies tend to show negative gradients, whereas metal-poor
galaxies tend to exhibit positive metallicity gradients. This result suggests
that the accretion of pristine gas in the periphery of galaxies plays an
important role in replenishing the gas in `typical' star-forming galaxies.

pressure (i.e., dark energy), or a modification of gravity, which necessarily
implies new degrees of freedom beyond those of Einstein gravity. In this paper
we present a third possibility, using only dark matter and ordinary matter. The
mechanism relies on the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter
through an effective metric. Dark matter couples to an Einstein-frame metric,
and experiences a matter-dominated, decelerating cosmology up to the present
time. Ordinary matter couples to an effective metric that depends also on the
DM density, in such a way that it experiences late-time acceleration. Linear
density perturbations are stable and propagate with arbitrarily small sound
speed, at least in the case of `pressure' coupling. Assuming a simple
parametrization of the effective metric, we show that our model can
successfully match a set of basic cosmological observables, including
luminosity distance, BAO measurements, angular-diameter distance to last
scattering {\it etc.} For the growth history of density perturbations, we find
an intriguing connection between the growth factor and the Hubble constant. To
get a growth history similar to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, our model predicts
a higher $H_0$, closer to the value preferred by direct estimates. On the flip
side, we tend to overpredict the growth of structures whenever $H_0$ is
comparable to the Planck preferred value. The model also tends to predict
larger redshift-space distortions at low redshift than $\Lambda$CDM.

to ordinary supernovae, and a nebular spectrum dominated by [Ca II] emission. A
striking feature of both transients is their host environments: PTF12bho is an
intra-cluster transient in the Coma Cluster, while PTF11kmb is located in a
loose galaxy group, at a physical offset ~150 kpc from the most likely host
galaxy. Deep Subaru imaging of PTF12bho rules out an underlying host system to
a limit of $M_R > -8.0$ mag, while Hubble Space Telescope imaging of PTF11kmb
reveals a marginal counterpart that, if real, could be either a background
galaxy or a globular cluster. We show that the offset distribution of Ca-rich
gap transients is significantly more extreme than that seen for Type Ia
supernovae or even short-hard gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Thus, if the offsets
are caused by a kick, they require larger kick velocities and/or longer merger
times than sGRBs. We also show that almost all Ca-rich gap transients found to

indicating a very old progenitor population; the remote locations could
partially be explained by these environments having the largest fraction of

simple scalings of mass, redshift and frequency. We then apply our calculation
to a realistic population of MBHBs evolving via 3-body scattering of stars in

For typical stellar distributions observed in massive galaxies, our calculation

band and a low frequency turnover in the spectrum is caused primarily by high
eccentricities.

HII region and HCN is stronger than HCO$^+$ there. Comparing with observations
of GMAs in the disks of M31 and M33 at similar angular resolution ($\sim 100$
pc), we find that GMAs in the outer disk of M51 are brighter in both HCN and

suggest that the parameter space allowed in supersymmetric theories is subject

entailing light DM particles. Previous studies have shown that light neutralino
DM in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), with parameters defined
at the electroweak scale, is still viable when the low energy spectrum of the
model features light sleptons, in which case, the relic density constraint can
be fulfilled. In view of this, we have investigated the viability of light
neutralinos as DM candidates in the MSSM, with parameters defined at the grand
unification scale. We have analysed the optimal choices of non-universalities
in the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters for both, gauginos and scalars,
in order to avoid the stringent experimental constraints. We show that light
neutralinos, with a mass as low as 25 GeV, are viable in supergravity scenarios
if the gaugino mass parameters at high energy are very non universal, while the
scalar masses can remain of the same order. These scenarios typically predict a
very small cross section of neutralinos off protons and neutrons, thereby being
very challenging for direct detection experiments. However, a potential
detection of smuons and selectrons at the LHC, together with a hypothetical
discovery of a gamma-ray signal from neutralino annihilations in dwarf
spheroidal galaxies could shed light on this kind of solutions. Finally, we
have investigated the naturalness of these scenarios, taking into account all
the potential sources of tuning. Besides the electroweak fine-tuning, we have
found that the tuning to reproduce the correct DM relic abundance and that to
match the measured Higgs mass can also be important when estimating the total
degree of naturalness.

separately describe group-level correlations between galaxy colour (1-halo
conformity) and large scale correlations induced by assembly bias (2-halo
conformity). We validate our analytical results using clustering measurements
in mock galaxy catalogs, finding that the model is accurate at the 10-20
percent level for a wide range of luminosities and length scales. We apply the
formalism to interpret the colour-dependent clustering of galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find good overall agreement between the data and
a model that has 1-halo conformity at a level consistent with previous results
based on an SDSS group catalog, although the clustering data require satellites
to be redder than suggested by the group catalog. Within our modelling
uncertainties, however, we do not find strong evidence of 2-halo conformity
driven by assembly bias in SDSS clustering.

testable in a variety of manners, from colliders physics to gravitational wave
astronomy. In particular one phase transition we know of, the Electroweak Phase
Transition (EWPT), could potentially be first order in BSM scenarios and
testable in the near future. If confirmed this could provide a mechanism for
Baryogenesis, which is one of the most important outstanding questions in
physics. To reliably make predictions it is necessary to have full control of
the finite temperature scalar potentials. However, as we show the standard
methods used in BSM physics to improve phase transition calculations, resumming
hard thermal loops, introduces significant errors into the scalar potential. In
addition, the standard methods make it impossible to match theories to an EFT
description reliably. In this paper we define a thermal resummation procedure
based on Partial Dressing (PD) for general BSM calculations of phase
transitions beyond the high-temperature approximation. Additionally, we
introduce the modified Optimized Partial Dressing (OPD) procedure, which is
numerically nearly as efficient as old incorrect methods, while yielding
identical results to the full PD calculation. This can be easily applied to
future BSM studies of phase transitions in the early universe. As an example,
we show that in unmixed singlet scalar extensions of the SM, the (O)PD
calculations make new phenomenological predictions compared to previous
analyses. An important future application is the study of EFTs at finite
temperature.

in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs; MX2). Here, we study the
effect of often occurring atomic vacancies on carrier scattering and transport
in p- and n-type monolayer MoS2. Due to charge trapping in vacancy-induced
in-gap states, both neutral and charged vacancies resembling, respectively,
short-range and combined short-range and long-range Coulomb scatterers, must be
considered. Using the T-matrix formalism, we demonstrate a strong
renormalization of the Born description of short-range scattering, manifested
in a pronounced reduction and a characteristic energy dependence of the
scattering rate. As a consequence, carrier scattering in TMDs with charged
vacancies is dominated by the long-range Coulomb-disorder scattering, giving
rise to a strong screening-induced temperature and density dependence of the
low-temperature carrier mobility. For TMDs with neutral vacancies, the absence
of intrinsic Coulomb disorder results in significantly higher mobilities as
well as an unusual density dependence of the mobility which decreases with the
carrier density. Our work illuminates the transport-limiting effects of
atomic-vacancy scattering relevant for high-mobility TMD devices.

commercial impact. Many distinct value estimators have been proposed, using
various statistical approaches. However, characterizing the errors incurred by
these estimators is an open problem: existing analytical approaches are not
powerful enough, and extensive empirical studies at large scale do not exist.
We conduct an extensive large-scale empirical study of 11 distinct value
estimators from four different approaches to the problem over families of
Zipfian distributions whose parameters model real-world applications. Our study
is the first that \emph{scales to the size of a billion-rows} that today's
large commercial databases have to operate in. This allows us to characterize
the error that is encountered in real-world applications of distinct value
estimation. By mining the generated data, we show that estimator error depends
on a key latent parameter --- the average uniform class size --- that has not
been studied previously. This parameter also allows us to unearth error
patterns that were previously unknown. Importantly, ours is the first approach
that provides a framework for \emph{visualizing the error patterns} in distinct
value estimation, facilitating discussion of this problem in enterprise
settings. Our characterization of errors can be used for several problems in
distinct value estimation, such as the design of hybrid estimators. This work

of hot gas, which constitute vast reservoirs for gas accretion. This Chapter
describes a mechanism that allows star-forming disc galaxies to extract gas
from their coronae. Stellar feedback powers a continuous circulation (galactic
fountain) of gas from the disc into the halo, producing mixing between
metal-rich disc material and metal-poor coronal gas. This mixing causes a
dramatic reduction of the cooling time of the corona making it condense and
accrete onto the disc. This fountain- driven accretion model makes clear
predictions for the kinematics of the extraplanar cold/warm gas in disc
galaxies, which are in good agreement with a number of independent
observations. The amount of gas accretion predicted by the model is of the
order of what is needed to sustain star formation. Accretion is expected to
occur preferentially in the outer parts of discs and its efficiency drops for
higher coronal temperatures. Thus galaxies are able to gather new gas as long
as they do not become too massive nor fall into large halos and maintain their
star-forming gaseous discs.

alternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,
rather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm
(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.
Robots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets
in the area without global localization or central control, and return the
targets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large
numbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas
result in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the
multiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed
throughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but
return to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging
behavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic
algorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes
and the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always
produces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search
time compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The
main contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the
advantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential
disadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic
algorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less
communication.

Reaction-Diffusion) version 1.0. AcCoRD is a sandbox reaction-diffusion solver
designed for the study of molecular communication systems. It uses a hybrid of
microscopic and mesoscopic simulation models that enables scalability via user
control of local accuracy. AcCoRD is developed in C as an open source command
line tool and includes utilities to process simulation output in MATLAB. The
latest code and links to user documentation can be found at
https://github.com/adamjgnoel/AcCoRD/. This paper provides an overview of
AcCoRD's design, including the motivation for developing a specialized
reaction-diffusion solver. The corresponding algorithms are presented in
detail, including the computational complexity of the microscopic and
mesoscopic models. Other novel derivations include the transition rates between
adjacent mesoscopic subvolumes of different sizes. Simulation results
demonstrate the use of AcCoRD as both an accurate reaction-diffusion solver and
one that is catered to the analysis of molecular communication systems. A link
is included to videos that demonstrate many of the simulated scenarios.
Additional insights from the simulation results include the selection of
suitable hybrid model parameters, the impact of reactive surfaces that are in
the proximity of a hybrid interface, and the size of a bounded environment that
is necessary to assume that it is unbounded. The development of AcCoRD is
ongoing, so its future direction is also discussed in order to highlight
improvements that will expand its potential areas of application. New features
that are being planned at the time of writing include a fluid flow model and
more complex actor behavior.

the most viable scenario to explain the observed Lyman-alpha luminosities and
Surface Brightness for the large majority of the nebulae and imply that a
significant amount of dense, ionized and cold clumps should be present within

kinematics compatible with stationary situation and, in some cases, suggestive
of rotating structures. However, definitive evidences for accretion onto
galaxies of the gas associated with the giant Lyman-alpha emission are not
unambiguously detected yet. Deep surveys currently ongoing using other bright,

12.75+-0.41 Mpc using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). The star
formation history reconstruction reveals that about 60 per cent of stars formed
during the initial period of star formation, about 12-14 Gyr ago. During the
next 10 Gyr DDO68 was in the quenched state, with only slight traces of star
formation. The onset of the most recent burst of star formation occurred about
300 Myr ago. We find that young populations with ages of several million to a
few hundred million years are widely spread across various parts of DDO68,
indicating an intense star formation episode with a high mean rate of 0.15
Msun/yr. A major fraction of the visible stars in the whole system (~80 per
cent) have low metallicities: Z = Zsun/50 - Zsun/20. The properties of the
northern periphery of DDO68 can be explained by an ongoing burst of star
formation induced by the minor merger of a small, gas-rich, extremely
metal-poor galaxy with a more typical dwarf galaxy. The current TRGB-based
distance of DDO68 implies a total negative peculiar velocity of ~500 km/s.

conceptually simple, our method outperforms more complex and computationally

motion of migrants. The nodes of the migration channel have different
""leakage"", i.e. the probability of change of the status of a migrant (from
migrant to non-migrant) may be different in the different countries along the
channel. In addition the nodes far from the entry node of the channel may be
more attractive for migrants in comparison to the nodes around the entry node
of the channel. We discuss below channels containing infinite number of nodes.
Two regimes of functioning of these channels are studied: stationary regime and
non-stationary regime. In the stationary regime of the functioning of the
channel the distribution of migrants in the countries of the channel is
described by a distribution that contains as particular case the Waring
distribution. In the non-stationary regime of functioning of the channel one
observes exponential increase or exponential decrease of the number of migrants
in the countries of the channel. It depends on the situation in the entry

a frequentist and Bayesian formulation. As a result, each individual experiment

between the three lowest frequency modes on chains. Sonification of the mode
heat fluxes revealed regions where the heat flux amplitude yields a somewhat
sinusoidal envelope with a long period similar to the relaxation time. This

output-feedback Model Predictive Control. Conditional densities given noisy
measurement data are propagated via the Particle Filter as an approximate
implementation of the Bayesian Filter. This enables a particle-based
representation of the conditional state density, or information state, which
naturally merges with scenario generation from the current system state. This
approach attempts to address the computational tractability questions of
general nonlinear stochastic optimal control. The Particle Filter and the
Scenario Approach are shown to be fully compatible and -- based on the time-
and measurement-update stages of the Particle Filter -- incorporated into the
optimization over future control sequences. A numerical example is presented
and examined for the dependence of solution and computational burden on the
sampling configurations of the densities, scenario generation and the
optimization horizon.

presumed to shock-heat to the virial temperature of the halo, following the

the halo to form a galaxy there. In the context of recent observational
evidence demonstrating the presence of high angular momentum gas in galaxy

to emphasize the role of ""cold flow"" accretion---anisotropic gas accretion
along cosmic filaments that does not shock-heat before sinking to the central
galaxy. We discuss the implications of these simulations, reviewing a number of
recent developments in the literature, and suggest a revision to the canonical
model as it relates to the expected angular momentum content of gaseous halos

then shade the geometry with the albedo and illumination. The residual between
our shaded geometry and the input image produces our detail map, which carries
high frequency information that is either insufficiently or incorrectly

fundamental parameters: T$_{\rm eff} = 15000\pm500$ K, $v \sin i = 31\pm3$ km
s$^{-1}$, $\log g \sim 4.0$. The interstellar extinction, A$_V$ $= 0.50\pm0.02$
mag, was measured using the strengths of some diffuse interstellar bands. We
also obtained $UBV(RI)_{\rm c}$ images of a $10^{\prime} \times 10^{\prime}$
region around the object. Photometry of projectionally close stars was used to
derive an interstellar extinction law in this direction and resulted in a
distance of 1300$\pm$100 pc to the object and a luminosity of $\log$
(L/L$_\odot) = 3.3\pm0.2$. We found no significant radial velocity variations

cannot be a pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be star. We argue that the
circumstellar gas and dust were produced during the object's evolution as most
likely a binary system, which contains an undetected secondary component and is
unlikely to be a merger product.

{\bf R}^{1+d} \to {\bf C}^m$ is vector-valued, $F\colon {\bf C}^m \to {\bf R}$
is a smooth potential which is positive, phase-rotation-invariant, and
homogeneous of order $p+1$ outside of the unit ball for some exponent $p >1$,
and $G: {\bf R} \times {\bf R}^d \to {\bf C}^m$ is a smooth, compactly
supported forcing term. This generalises the scalar defocusing nonlinear
Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation, in which $m=1$ and $F(v) = \frac{1}{p+1}
|v|^{p+1}$. In this paper we study the supercritical case where $d \geq 3$ and
$p > 1 + \frac{4}{d-2}$. We show that in this case, there exists a smooth
potential $F$ for some sufficiently large $m$, positive and homogeneous of
order $p+1$ outside of the unit ball, and a smooth compactly choice of initial
data $u(0)$ and forcing term $G$ for which the solution develops a finite time
singularity. In fact the solution is locally discretely self-similar with
respect to parabolic rescaling of spacetime. This demonstrates that one cannot
hope to establish a global regularity result for the scalar defocusing NLS
unless one uses some special property of that equation that is not shared by
these defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger systems.
  As in a previous paper of the author considering the analogous problem for
the nonlinear wave equation, the basic strategy is to first select the mass,
momentum, and energy densities of $u$, then $u$ itself, and then finally design
the potential $F$ in order to solve the required equation.

study the relationship between the $M_{\rm SMBH}$ of the quasar and the stellar

Besides the scatter, we find a good agreement between radio-quiet quasars and
AGN+quiescent galaxies and between radio-loud quasars and AGN. Our analysis
does not support the hypothesis of using $\sigma$([O III] $\lambda$5007) as a
surrogate for stellar velocity dispersions in high-mass, high-luminosity
quasars. We also investigate the relationship between the 5 GHz radio-continuum
luminosity, $L_{\rm~5\,GHz}$, of the quasar host galaxy with both $M_{\rm

larger stellar velocity dispersions have larger $L_{\rm 5\,GHz}$. Using the
results of our fitting for the narrow emission lines of [O III] $\lambda$5007

  Architectures and Algorithms http://hpc.pnl.gov/IA3/IA3/Program.html",,,,"cs.MS cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Iterative methods on irregular grids have been used widely in all areas of
comptational science and engineering for solving partial differential equations
with complex geometry. They provide the flexibility to express complex shapes
with relatively low computational cost. However, the direction of the evolution
of high-performance processors in the last two decades have caused serious
degradation of the computational efficiency of iterative methods on irregular
grids, because of relatively low memory bandwidth. Data compression can in
principle reduce the necessary memory memory bandwidth of iterative methods and
thus improve the efficiency. We have implemented several data compression
algorithms on the PEZY-SC processor, using the matrix generated for the HPCG
benchmark as an example. For the SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication)
part of the HPCG benchmark, the best implementation without data compression
achieved 11.6Gflops/chip, close to the theoretical limit due to the memory
bandwidth. Our implementation with data compression has achieved 32.4Gflops.
This is of course rather extreme case, since the grid used in HPCG is
geometrically regular and thus its compression efficiency is very high.
However, in real applications, it is in many cases possible to make a large
part of the grid to have regular geometry, in particular when the resolution is
high. Note that we do not need to change the structure of the program, except
for the addition of the data compression/decompression subroutines. Thus, we
believe the data compression will be very useful way to improve the performance
of many applications which rely on the use of irregular grids.

monetization opportunities not only to the owners of the social networking
platforms but also to their influential users by offering a ""cut"" on the
advertising revenue. We consider a social network (the host) that sells
ad-engagements to advertisers by inserting their ads, in the form of promoted
posts, into the feeds of carefully selected ""initial endorsers"" or seed users:
these users receive monetary incentives in exchange for their endorsements. The
endorsements help propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers. In this
context, the problem for the host is is to allocate ads to influential users,
taking into account the propensity of ads for viral propagation, and carefully
apportioning the monetary budget of each of the advertisers between incentives
to influential users and ad-engagement costs, with the rational goal of
maximizing its own revenue. We consider a monetary incentive for the
influential users, which is proportional to their influence potential. We show
that revenue maximization in incentivized social advertising corresponds to the
problem of monotone submodular function maximization, subject to a partition
matroid constraint on the ads-to-seeds allocation, and submodular knapsack
constraints on the advertisers' budgets. This problem is NP-hard and we devise
2 greedy algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, which differ in
their sensitivity to seed user incentive costs. Our approximation algorithms
require repeatedly estimating the expected marginal gain in revenue as well as
in advertiser payment. By exploiting a connection to the recent advances made
in scalable estimation of expected influence spread, we devise efficient and
scalable versions of the greedy algorithms.

shown performance improvement in traditional object detection systems such as
the DPMs. It, however, has been largely ignored in deep neural network based
detection systems. This paper presents a method of integrating a mixture of
object models and region-based convolutional networks for accurate object
detection. Each mixture component accounts for both object aspect ratio and
multi-scale contextual information explicitly: (i) it exploits a mixture of
tiling configurations in the RoI pooling to remedy the warping artifacts caused
by a single type RoI pooling (e.g., with equally-sized 7 x 7 cells), and to
respect the underlying object shapes more; (ii) it ""looks from both the inside
and the outside of a RoI"" by incorporating contextual information at two
scales: global context pooled from the whole image and local context pooled
from the surrounding of a RoI. To facilitate accurate detection, this paper
proposes a multi-stage detection scheme for integrating the mixture of object
models, which utilizes the detection results of the model at the previous stage
as the proposals for the current in both training and testing. The proposed
method is called the aspect ratio and context aware region-based convolutional
network (ARC-R-CNN). In experiments, ARC-R-CNN shows very competitive results
with Faster R-CNN [41] and R-FCN [10] on two datasets: the PASCAL VOC and the

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and put an upper limit of 5\% Spitzer on the

establish sufficient but not necessary conditions for the point configuration

plutonium-based fuel mixtures, the variation in antineutrino production over
the cycle reflects both the initial core fissile inventory and its evolution.
Under the assumption of constant thermal power, we calculate the rate at which
antineutrinos are emitted from variously fueled cores, and the evolution of
that rate as measured by a representative ton-scale antineutrino detector. We
find that antineutrino flux decreases with burnup for Low Enriched Uranium
cores, increases for full mixed-oxide (MOX) cores, and does not appreciably
change for cores with a MOX fraction of approximately 75%. Accounting for
uncertainties in the fission yields, in the emitted antineutrino spectra, and
the detector response function, we show that the difference in core-wide MOX
fractions at least as small as 8% can be distinguished using a hypothesis test.
The test compares the evolution of the antineutrino rate relative to an initial
value over part or all of the cycle. The use of relative rates reduces the
sensitivity of the test to an independent thermal power measurement, making the
result more robust against possible countermeasures. This rate-only approach
also offers the potential advantage of reducing the cost and complexity of the
antineutrino detectors used to verify the diversion, compared to methods that
depend on the use of the antineutrino spectrum. A possible application is the
verification of the disposition of surplus plutonium in nuclear reactors.

Haldane insulating (HI) phase which displays edge states and particle imbalance

agreement with the entanglement spectrum of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki

emphasizes that the absence of degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum is not

space that is dual to the standard phase space of position and momentum. In

parameterization of the spinning degrees of freedom. This allows for a purely
first class formulation that generalizes the usual relativistic description of
spinless particles and provides several insights into the nature of spin and
its relationship with spacetime and locality. In particular, we find that the
spin motion acts as a Lorentz contraction on the four-velocity and that, in
addition to proper time, spinning particles posses a second gauge invariant
observable which we call proper angle. Heuristically, this proper angle
represents the amount of Zitterbewegung necessary for a spin transition to
occur. Additionally, we show that the spin velocity satisfies a causality
constraint, and even more stringently, that it is constant along classical
trajectories. This leads to the notion of ""half-quantum"" states which violate
the classical equations of motion, and yet do not experience an exponential
suppression in the path integral. Finally we give a full analysis of the

built using a new optimization approach that we call self-critical sequence

utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the

actor-critic methods must do) and estimating normalization (as REINFORCE
algorithms typically do) is avoided, while at the same time harmonizing the

that directly optimizing the CIDEr metric with SCST and greedy decoding at
test-time is highly effective. Our results on the MSCOCO evaluation sever

considered are (i) a strong and (ii) a weak form of almost sure stability of
the estimation error as well as (ii) quadratic stability in expectation. For
all three objectives, we derive lower bounds on the smallest channel capacity

the different criteria. Finally, we prove that a memoryless noisy channel in

compressive sensing). We propose an algorithm that actively collects data to
search for sparse signals using only noisy measurements of the average values
on rectangular regions (including single points), based on the greedy
maximization of information gain. We analyze our algorithm in 1d and show that
it requires $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{\mu^2}+k^2)$ measurements to recover all of $k$
signal locations with small Bayes error, where $\mu$ and $n$ are the signal
strength and the size of the search space, respectively. We also show that
active designs can be fundamentally more efficient than passive designs with
region sensing, contrasting with the results of Arias-Castro, Candes, and
Davenport (2013). We demonstrate the empirical performance of our algorithm on
a search problem using satellite image data and in high dimensions.

  Estimation Using Lexicons","Accepted by IEEE IJCNN 2017. Copyright transferred to IEEE",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Though there are some works on improving distributed word representations
using lexicons, the improper overfitting of the words that have multiple
meanings is a remaining issue deteriorating the learning when lexicons are
used, which needs to be solved. An alternative method is to allocate a vector
per sense instead of a vector per word. However, the word representations
estimated in the former way are not as easy to use as the latter one. Our
previous work uses a probabilistic method to alleviate the overfitting, but it
is not robust with a small corpus. In this paper, we propose a new neural
network to estimate distributed word representations using a lexicon and a
corpus. We add a lexicon layer in the continuous bag-of-words model and a
threshold node after the output of the lexicon layer. The threshold rejects the
unreliable outputs of the lexicon layer that are less likely to be the same
with their inputs. In this way, it alleviates the overfitting of the polysemous
words. The proposed neural network can be trained using negative sampling,
which maximizing the log probabilities of target words given the context words,
by distinguishing the target words from random noises. We compare the proposed
neural network with the continuous bag-of-words model, the other works
improving it, and the previous works estimating distributed word
representations using both a lexicon and a corpus. The experimental results
show that the proposed neural network is more efficient and balanced for both
semantic tasks and syntactic tasks than the previous works, and robust to the
size of the corpus.

Knowledge based Fuzzy Information System (DKFIS) improves the prediction
accuracy attained by ANFIS alone. The proposed framework has been implemented
on a noisy and incomplete dataset acquired from a hydrocarbon field located at
western part of India. Here, oil saturation has been predicted from four
different well logs i.e. gamma ray, resistivity, density, and clay volume. In
the first stage, depending on zero or near zero and non-zero oil saturation
levels the input vector is classified into two classes (Class 0 and Class 1)
using SVM. The classification results have been further fine-tuned applying
expert knowledge based on the relationship among predictor variables i.e. well
logs and target variable - oil saturation. Second, an ANFIS is designed to
predict non-zero (Class 1) oil saturation values from predictor logs. The
predicted output has been further refined based on expert knowledge. It is
apparent from the experimental results that the expert intervention with
qualitative judgment at each stage has rendered the prediction into the
feasible and realistic ranges. The performance analysis of the prediction in
terms of four performance metrics such as correlation coefficient (CC), root
mean square error (RMSE), and absolute error mean (AEM), scatter index (SI) has
established DKFIS as a useful tool for reservoir characterization.

negative Markov processes however, it is conjectured that everything can be
expressed in a more direct way using the $W$ scale function which intervenes in
the two-sided first passage problem, modulo performing various integrals. This
conjecture arises from work on Levy processes \cite{AKP,Pispot,APP,Iva,IP,
ivanovs2013potential,AIZ,APY}, where the $W$ scale function has explicit
Laplace transform, and is therefore easily computable; furthermore it was found
in the papers above that a second scale function $Z$ introduced in \cite{AKP}
greatly simplifies first passage laws, especially for reflected processes.
  This paper gathers a collection of first passage formulas for spectrally
negative Parisian L\'evy processes, expressed in terms of $W,Z$ which may serve
as an ""instruction kit"" for computing quantities of interest in applications,
for example in risk theory and mathematical finance.
  To illustrate the usefulness of our list, we construct a new index for the
valuation of financial companies modeled by spectrally negative L\'evy
processes, based on a Dickson-Waters modifications of the de Finetti optimal

However, outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei not only
eject gas from galaxies, but also prevent gas from accreting in the first
place. Furthermore, gas previously ejected from a galaxy can re-accrete onto
(the same or a different) galaxy. Because this gas has a high metallicity, its
cooling rate is relatively high, which will increase its chances to re-accrete.
This complex interplay between gas inflows and outflows is discussed in this
chapter. Wind recycling is found to be an important process that fuels galaxies
at late times and the recycled gas has different properties than gas accreting

of the individual patches appear to be erratic. Historically, PA has been
defined very loosely and we argue that the use of the term ""pulsating"" is
inappropriate since our findings and other published results are not regularly

we find that the observational constraints do not fit well with the flow

important input parameter for lightning location systems that use time of
arrival (TOA) method. This velocity is normally fixed at or near the speed of
light. However, this study finds that the radio waves from two submarine
communication transmitters at 20.9 kHz and 23.4 kHz exhibit phase propagation
velocities that are $\sim$0.51% slower and $\sim$0.64% faster than the speed of
light as a result of sky wave contributions and ground effects. Therefore, a
novel technique with a variable phase propagation velocity is implemented for
the first time in the TOA method and applied to electric field recordings with
a long-baseline lightning location system that consists of four radio receivers
in western Europe. The lightning locations inferred from variable velocities
improve the accuracy of locations inferred from a fixed velocity by
$\sim$0.89-1.06 km when compared to the lightning locations reported by the UK
MetOffice. The normal distributions of the observed phase propagation
velocities in small geographic areas are not centered at the speed of light.
Consequently, representative velocities can be calculated for many small
geographic areas to produce a velocity map over central France where numerous
lightning discharges occurred. This map reflects the impact of sky waves and
ground effects on the calculation of lightning locations as a result of the
network configuration. It is concluded that the use of variable phase
propagation velocities mitigates the influence of sky waves and ground effects

This grouping typically relies on imposing local smoothness constraints but
almost never on enforcing more global constraints on the trajectories. In this
paper, we propose an approach to imposing global consistency by first inferring
behavioral patterns from the ground truth and then using them to guide the

weight sharing by parameterizing kernels in the spectral domain spanned by

strive to overcome two key challenges: how to share coefficients and conduct
multi-scale analysis in different parts of the graph for a single shape, and
how to share information across related but different shapes that may be
represented by very different graphs. Towards these goals, we introduce a
spectral parameterization of dilated convolutional kernels and a spectral

distinction between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos survives even in the almost

result from the OPE of the stress tensor at high frequency as well as the
hydrodynamic behaviour of the theory at low frequencies. The sum rule states
that a weighted integral of the spectral density over frequencies is
proportional to the energy density of the theory. We show that the
proportionality constant can be written in terms the Hofman-Maldacena variables
$t_2, t_4$ which determine the three point function of the stress tensor. For
theories which admit a two derivative gravity dual this proportionality
constant is given by $\frac{d}{2(d+1)}$. We then use causality constraints and
obtain bounds on the sum rule which are valid in any conformal field theory.
Finally we demonstrate that the high frequency behaviour of the spectral
function in the vector and the tensor channel are also determined by the
Hofman-Maldacena variables.

digital data become available for analysis and decision support. When
physicians are prescribing treatments to a patient, they need to consider a

Machine learning based Clinical Decision Support systems can be a solution to
the data challenges. In this work we focus on a class of decision support in
which the physicians' decision is directly predicted. Concretely, the model
would assign higher probabilities to decisions that it presumes the physician
are more likely to make. Thus the CDS system can provide physicians with
rational recommendations. We also address the problem of correlation in target
features: Often a physician is required to make multiple (sub-)decisions in a
block, and that these decisions are mutually dependent. We propose a solution
to the target correlation problem using a tensor factorization model. In order
to handle the patients' historical information as sequential data, we apply the
so-called Encoder-Decoder-Framework which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN) as encoders and a tensor factorization model as a decoder, a combination
which is novel in machine learning. With experiments with real-world datasets
we show that the proposed model does achieve better prediction performances.

produced due to nonzero chirality, which is induced from the difference of
winding numbers carried by the gluon topological configuration (QCD sphaleron).
This local domain is called the chiral-imbalance medium characterized by
nonzero chiral chemical potential, which can be interpreted as the time
variation of the strong CP phase. We find that the chiral chemical potential
generates the parity breaking term in the electromagnetic form factor of
charged pions. Heavy ion collision experiments could observe the
phenomenological consequence of this parity-odd form factor through the elastic
scattering of a pion and a photon in the medium. Then we quantify the asymmetry
rate of the parity violation by measuring the polarization of the photon
associated with the pion, and discuss how it could be measured in a definite
lab frame. We roughly estimate the typical size of the asymmetry, just by
picking up the pion resonant process, and find that the signal can be
sufficiently larger than possible background events from parity-breaking
electroweak process. Our findings might provide a novel possibility to make a
manifest detection for the remnant of the strong CP violation.

polarised-muon scattering on longitudinally polarised deuterons using a $^6$LiD
target. The data were taken at $160~{\rm GeV}$ beam energy and the results are
shown for the kinematic range $1~({\rm GeV}/c)^2 < Q^2 < 100~({\rm GeV}/c)^2$
in photon virtuality, $0.004<x<0.7$ in the Bjorken scaling variable and $W >
4~{\rm GeV}/c^2$ in the mass of the hadronic final state. The deuteron
double-spin asymmetry $A_1^{\rm d}$ and the deuteron longitudinal-spin
structure function $g_1^{\rm d}$ are presented in bins of $x$ and $Q^2$.
Towards lowest accessible values of $x$, $g_1^{\rm d}$ decreases and becomes
consistent with zero within uncertainties. The presented final $g_1^{\rm d}$
values together with the recently published final $g_1^{\rm p}$ values of
COMPASS are used to again evaluate the Bjorken sum rule and perform the QCD fit
to the $g_1$ world data at next-to-leading order of the strong coupling
constant. In both cases, changes in central values of the resulting numbers are
well within statistical uncertainties. The flavour-singlet axial charge $a_0$,
{which is identified in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalisation scheme with the
total contribution of quark helicities to the nucleon spin}, is extracted from
only the COMPASS deuteron data with negligible extrapolation uncertainty: $a_0
(Q^2 = 3~({\rm GeV}/c)^2) = 0.32 \pm 0.02_{\rm stat} \pm0.04_{\rm syst} \pm
0.05_{\rm evol}$. Together with the recent results on the proton spin structure
function $g_1^{\rm p}$, the results on $g_1^{\rm d}$ constitute the COMPASS
legacy on the measurements of $g_1$ through inclusive spin-dependent deep
inelastic scattering.

common goal in the emerging fields of molecular electronics and spintronics. In
this device two ferromagnetic electrodes are used to enhance the
electroluminescence intensity of the OLED through a magnetic control of the
spin polarization of the injected carriers. The major difficulty is that the
driving voltage of an OLED device exceeds of a few volts, while spin injection
in organic materials is only efficient at low voltages. We report here the
fabrication of a spin-OLED that uses a conjugated polymer as bipolar spin
collector layer and ferromagnetic electrodes. Through a careful engineering of
the organic/inorganic interfaces we have succeeded in obtaining a
light-emitting device showing spin-valve effects at high voltages (up to 14 V).
This has allowed us to detect a magneto-electroluminescence enhancement on the
order of a 2.4 % at 9 V for the antiparallel configuration of the magnetic

found that during this quiet period the hard X-ray flux (Swift/BAT, 15-50 keV)
and radio flux (RATAN-600, 11 GHz) have been strongly anti-correlated. Both
radio flares occurred after transitions of the microquasar to a 'hypersoft'
X-ray state that occurred in February 2011 and in the end of August 2016. The
giant flare was predicted by us in the first ATel #9416. Indeed after dramatic

'quenched state') a small flare (0.7 Jy at 4-11 GHz) developed on MJD 57632 and
then on MJD 57644.5 almost simultaneously with X-rays radio flux rose from 0.01

fitted by a exponential law that could be a initial phase of the relativistic
electrons generation by internal shock waves in the jets. Initially spectra
were optically thick at frequencies lower 2 GHz and optically thin at

mining analyses, including data editing for classifiers, summarization, and
outlier detection. It is well known that for similarity search the superiority
of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as
we consider ever larger datasets. However, as we shall show, the same is not
true for clustering. Clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally
expensive operation. In this work, we address this issue in two ways. We
propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds
to prune off a very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This
pruning strategy is admissible and gives us provably identical results to the
brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For
datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can
use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a
most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering into an anytime
framework. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and
multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology,
medicine and entomology. In addition, we show the generality of our clustering
framework to other domains by efficiently obtaining semantically significant
clusters in protein sequences using the Edit Distance, the discrete data

this purpose, extreme radiation hardness up to the expected maximum fluence of

generation of 3D pixels, i.e., increased pixel granularity (50x50 or 25x100 um2
cell size), thinner active region (~100 um), narrower columnar electrodes (~5
um diameter) with reduced inter-electrode spacing (~30 um), and very slim edges
(~100 um). The fabrication of the first batch of these new 3D sensors was
recently completed at FBK on Si-Si direct wafer bonded 6-inch substrates.
Initial electrical test results, performed at wafer level on sensors and test
structures, highlighted very promising performance, in good agreement with TCAD
simulations: low leakage current (<1 pA/column), intrinsic breakdown voltage of
more than 150 V, capacitance of about 50 fF/column, thus assessing the validity
of the design approach. A large variety of pixel sensors compatible with both
existing (e.g., ATLAS FEI4 and CMS PSI46) and future (e.g., RD53) read-out
chips were fabricated, that were also electrically tested on wafer using a
temporary metal layer patterned as strips shorting rows of pixels together.
This allowed a statistically significant distribution of the relevant
electrical quantities to be obtained, thus gaining insight into the impact of
process-induced defects. A few 3D strip test structures were irradiated with
X-rays, showing inter-strip resistance of at least several GOhm even after 50
Mrad(Si) dose, thus proving the p-spray robustness. We present the most
important design and technological aspects, and results obtained from the

4e-sites in a statistical distribution. In both compounds Eu atoms occupying
the crystallographic 2a-sites are in a homogeneous mixed valent state ~ 2.6 -
2.7. From our magnetization studies in an applied H = 9 Tesla, we infer that
the valence of Eu-atoms in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 at the 2a-sites exhibits a shift
towards 2+. Our XPS studies corroborate the occurrence of valence fluctuations
of Eu and after Ar-ion sputtering show evidence of enhanced population of
Eu2+-states. Resistivity measurements, down to 2 K suggest a semi-metallic
nature for both compounds.

integrability is an intimate one: a continuous function on a closed and bounded
interval is always Riemann integrable whereas a Riemann integrable function is
continuous almost everywhere. In the setting of functions taking values in
infinite dimensional spaces that include quasi Banach spaces, one encounters
certain curious situations involving the breakdown of the above stated
phenomena, besides the failure of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the
non-existence of primitives for continuous functions! While some of these
properties can surely be salvaged within the class of Banach spaces, it turns
out that certain important properties involving vector integration that include
Riemann integration no longer hold in an infinite dimensional setting. This
will be seen to be the case, for example, in situations when it is required to
integrate functions which are continuous with respect to certain well known (
generally compatible) linear topologies on X (resp. its dual) weaker than the
norm topology. As we shall see in Section 3(a), such a requirement imposes
rather severe restrictions on the space in question. The present paper is
devoted to a discussion of these issues which will be examined in the setting
of Banach and Frechet spaces on the one hand and of quasi Banach spaces on the
other. The paper concludes with a brief (but non-technical) description on

toolbox for mapping population receptive fields (pRFs) based on fMRI data. This
generic approach is intended to work with stimuli of any dimension and is
demonstrated and validated in the context of 2D retinotopic mapping. The
framework enables the experimenter to specify generative (encoding) models of
fMRI timeseries, in which experimental manipulations enter a pRF model of
neural activity, which in turns drives a nonlinear model of neurovascular
coupling and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response. The neuronal
and haemodynamic parameters are estimated together on a voxel-by-voxel or
region-of-interest basis using a Bayesian estimation algorithm (variational
Laplace). This offers several novel contributions to receptive field modelling.
The variance / covariance of parameters are estimated, enabling receptive
fields to be plotted while properly representing uncertainty about pRF size and
location. Variability in the haemodynamic response across the brain is
accounted for. Furthermore, the framework introduces formal hypothesis testing
to pRF analysis, enabling competing models to be evaluated based on their model
evidence (approximated by the variational free energy), which represents the
optimal tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Using simulations and
empirical data, we found that parameters typically used to represent pRF size
and neuronal scaling are strongly correlated, which should be taken into
account when making inferences. We used the framework to compare the evidence
for six variants of pRF model using 7T functional MRI data and we found a
circular Difference of Gaussians (DoG) model to be the best explanation for our
data overall. We hope this framework will prove useful for mapping stimulus

possible between channels lying close in $k-$space. When the energy of edge

i\delta_j\xi)^{-1} \, e^{-c \xi^2}$ for $\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_n\in
\mathbb{R}, c >0$ (in which case $g$ is called totally positive of Gaussian
type).
  In analogy to Beurling's sampling theorem for the Paley-Wiener space of
entire functions, we prove that every separated set with lower Beurling density
$>1$ is a sampling set for the shift-invariant space generated by such a $g$.
In view of the known necessary density conditions, this result is optimal and
validates the heuristic reasonings in the engineering literature.
  Using a subtle connection between sampling in shift-invariant spaces and the
theory of Gabor frames, we show that the set of phase-space shifts of $g$ with
respect to a rectangular lattice $\alpha \mathbb{Z} \times \beta \mathbb{Z}$
forms a frame, if and only if $\alpha \beta <1$. This solves an open problem
going back to Daubechies in 1990 for the class of totally positive functions of
Gaussian type.
  The proof strategy involves the connection between sampling in
shift-invariant spaces and Gabor frames, a new characterization of sampling
sets ""without inequalities"" in the style of Beurling, new properties of totally
positive functions, and the interplay between zero sets of functions in a
shift-invariant space and functions in the Bargmann-Fock space.

outbursts detected by INTEGRAL and Swift between 2014 and 2016 are consistent
with Type I outbursts seen in Be/XRBs, occurring around periastron. Comparing

occurrence and increasing I-band flux. A periodic analysis of subdivisions of

generated by primary fields of a free massless bosonic field. In particular, we

As a bridge between the two parameters, we use the pole mass $M_b$ of the $b$
quark, which can be calculated in both models. The running mass is not a
fundamental parameter of the SM Lagrangian, but the product of the running
Yukawa coupling $y_b$ and the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Since there exist
different prescriptions to define the latter, the relations considered in the
paper involve a certain amount of freedom. All the definitions can be related
to each other in perturbation theory. Nevertheless, we argue in favor of a
certain gauge-independent prescription and provide a relation which can be
directly used to deduce the value of the Yukawa coupling of the $b$ quark at
the electroweak scale from its effective QCD running mass. This approach allows
one to resum large logarithms $\ln(m_b/M_t)$ systematically. Numerical analysis
shows that, indeed, the corrections to the proposed relation are much smaller
than those between $y_b$ and $M_b$.

programming languages that include dynamic software upgrades, for upgrading
software code during run-time. Dynamic SOS (DSOS) is built on top of the
Modular SOS of P. Mosses, with an underlying category theory formalization. The
idea of Dynamic SOS is to bring out the essential differences between dynamic
upgrade constructs and program execution constructs. The important feature of
Modular SOS (MSOS) that we exploit in DSOS is the sharp separation of the
program execution code from the additional (data) structures needed at
run-time. In DSOS we aim to achieve the same modularity and decoupling for
dynamic software upgrades. This is partly motivated by the long term goal of
having machine-checkable proofs for general results like type safety.
  We exemplify Dynamic SOS on two languages supporting dynamic software
upgrades, namely the C-like Proteus, which supports updating of variables,
functions, records, or types at specific program points, and Creol, which
supports dynamic class upgrades in the setting of concurrent objects. Existing
type analyses for software upgrades can be done on top of DSOS too, as we
illustrate for Proteus.
  As a side result we define of a general encapsulating construction on Modular
SOS useful in situations where a form of encapsulation of the execution is
needed. We use encapsulation in the Creol setting of concurrent object-oriented
programming with active objects and asynchronous method calls.

verification mechanism was integrated into the i-voting system in order to
resist corrupted voting devices, including the so called Student's Attack where
a student practically showed that the voting system is indeed not verifiable by
developing several versions of malware capable of blocking or even changing the
vote. This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote
they cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification
phase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification
device. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the
voter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase
in detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification
application may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide
range, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the
elections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism
for the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability. Not only is
the proposed mechanism secure and resistant against corrupted verification
devices, so does it successfully verify whether the vote is correctly stored in
the system. We also highlight that our proposed mechanism brings only symmetric
encryptions and hash functions on the verification device, thereby mitigating
these weaknesses in an efficient way with a negligible cost. More concretely,
it brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification
device, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates. Finally, we prove the
security of the proposed verification mechanism and compare the cost complexity
of the proposed method with that of the current mechanism.

that the physical metric, its scalar curvature and the scalar field are regular
under some parameter restrictions, but there is a curvature singularity of the
auxiliary metric compatible with the connection. We find that the on-shell
action is finite and the probability does not reduce to its GR value. We also
find that the Vilenkin instanton in the EiBI theory would still cause the

observationally inconsistent. This result suggests that the singularity of the

Half-doped manganites being at the verge of metal-insulator character are thus
good candidates to be slave layers in FTJs. However, the phase diagram of these
oxides is extremely sensitive to strain and thus can be radically different
when integrated in epitaxial FTJs. Here we report a systematic study of
large-area (A = 4 to 100 um2) Pt/La0.5Sr0.5MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
(Pt/HD/BTO/LSMO) FTJs, having different thicknesses of the ferroelectric
(2-3nm) and HD layers (1-2nm), grown on substrates imposing either tensile
(SrTiO3) or compressive (LaAlO3) strains. Room-temperature electric
characterization of the FTJs shows polarization-controlled ON/ OFF states.
Clear evidences of field-induced M/I transition (difference between junction
resistance in OFF and ON state is increased of more than one order of
magnitude) are observed in junctions prepared on SrTiO3 but the HD layer is
generally metallic on LaAlO3. Moreover, the M/I transition is only confined in
an interfacial layer of the slave film thus entailing an overall reduction of
TER. The orderly results reported here give some hints towards selection of HD

visible and near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, complemented with
mid-infrared Spitzer/IRAC imaging, in order to obtain a census of its stellar
content and the nature of its embedded sources. Our observations show that the
globule contains an embedded aggregate of about 30 very young ($\lesssim
1$~Myr) stellar objects, for which we estimate a total mass of ~ 90 M_sun. The
most massive members are three systems containing early B-type stars. Two of
them most likely produced very compact HII regions, one of them being still
highly embedded and coinciding with a peak seen in emission lines
characterising the photon dominated region (PDR). Two of these three systems
are resolved binaries, and one of those contains a visible Herbig Be star. An
approximate derivation of the mass function of the members of the aggregate
gives hints of a slope at high masses shallower than the classical Salpeter
slope, and a peak of the mass distribution at a mass higher than that at which
the widely adopted log-normal initial mass function peaks. The emission
distribution of H$_2$ and Br gamma, tracing the PDR and the ionised gas phase,
respectively, suggests that molecular gas is distributed as a shell around the
embedded aggregate, filled with centrally-condensed ionised gas. Both, the
morphology and the low excitation of the HII region, indicate that the sources
of ionisation are the B stars of the embedded aggregate, rather than the
external UV field caused by the O stars of Cygnus OB2. The youth of the
embedded cluster, combined with the isolation of the globule, suggests that
star formation in the globule was triggered by the passage of the ionisation
front.

also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it
possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other

problem. We apply this method to a generic CFT with weakly broken higher spin

show that the spectrum of broken currents, for any value of the spin, follows

spectrum of several models, including the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher model around
four dimensions, the large $O(N)$ model in $2<d<4$ and cubic models around six
dimensions, not necessarily unitary. We also discuss models where the
fundamental field is not part of the spectrum. Examples of this are weakly
coupled gauge theories and our method gives an on-shell gauge invariant way to
study them. At first order in the coupling constant we show that again the
spectrum follows from crossing symmetry, to all values of the spin. Our method
provides an alternative to usual perturbation theory without any reference to a

asteroids.
  The ASIME 2016 Conference produced a layered record of discussions from the
asteroid scientists and the asteroid miners to understand each other's key
concerns and to address key scientific questions from the asteroid mining
companies: Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries and TransAstra. These
Questions were the focus of the two day conference, were addressed by
scientists inside and outside of the ASIME Conference and are the focus of this
White Paper.
  The Questions from the asteroid mining companies have been sorted into the
three asteroid science themes: 1) survey, 2) surface and 3) subsurface and 4)
Other. The answers to those Questions have been provided by the scientists with
their conference presentations or edited directly into an early open-access

Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low pathfinder), provides
advancements in our capability of probing Galactic magnetism through
low-frequency polarimetry. Maps of diffuse polarized radio emission and Faraday
rotation can be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the
magnetic fields in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been
probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a 5x5 degree
region centred on the nearby galaxy IC342 using LOFAR in the frequency range
115-178 MHz at 4 arcmin resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect
foreground Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth
(different amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows rich
polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150 MHz. We
detect two overlapping diffuse polarized features that are clearly separated in
Faraday depth. Faraday-thick structures at such low frequencies would be too
strongly depolarized to explain the observations and are therefore rejected.
Only Faraday thin structures will not be strongly depolarized; producing such
structures requires localized variations in the ratio of synchrotron emissivity
to Faraday depth per unit distance, which can arise from several physical
phenomena, such as a transition between regions of ionized and neutral gas. We
conclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose that
the emission originates from two neutral clouds in the local ISM. We have
modeled the Faraday rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the line
of sight component of magnetic field of the local ISM for this direction varies
between -0.86 and +0.12 uG. We propose that this may be a useful method for
mapping magnetic fields within the local ISM.

survey's 65 clusters in three WFC3/UVIS filters F275W, F336W, and F438W. The
new survey also adds super-solar metallicity open cluster NGC 6791 to increase
the metallicity diversity. The combined survey provides a homogeneous 5-band
data set that can be used to pursue a broad range of scientific investigations.
In particular, the chosen UV filters allow the identification of multiple
stellar populations by targeting the regions of the spectrum that are sensitive
to abundance variations in C, N, and O. In order to provide the community with
uniform preliminary catalogs, we have devised an automated procedure that
performs high-quality photometry on the new UV observations (along with similar
observations of seven other programs in the archive). This procedure finds and
measures the potential sources on each individual exposure using library
point-spread functions and cross-correlates these observations with the
original ACS-Survey catalog. The catalog of 57 clusters we publish here will be
useful to identify stars in the different stellar populations, in particular
for spectroscopic follow-up. Eventually, we will construct a more sophisticated
catalog and artificial-star tests based on an optimal reduction of the UV
survey data, but the catalogs presented here give the community the chance to

post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, representing the space curvature produced by
unit rest mass. The parameter $\gamma$ in turn has been constrained by
comparing the arrival times of photons originating in distant transient events,
such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts as well as giant pulses of pulsars.
Those measurements normally correspond to an individual burst event with very
limited energy bands and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In this letter, the
discrepancy in the pulse arrival times of the Crab Pulsar between different
energy bands is obtained by the phase difference between corresponding pulse
profiles. This allows us to compare the pulse arrival times at the largest
energy band differences, between radio and optical, radio and X-ray, radio and
gamma-ray respectively. As the pulse profiles are generated by phase-folding
thousands of individual pulses, the time discrepancies between two energy bands
are actually measured from thousands of events at each energy band, which
corresponds to much higher S/N. The upper limit of the $\gamma$ discrepancy set
by such an extensively-observed and well-modeled source is as follows:
$\gamma_{radio}-\gamma_{\gamma-ray}<3.28\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference
of $E_{\gamma-ray}/E_{radio}\sim10^{13}$,
$\gamma_{radio}-\gamma_{X-ray}<4.01\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference of
$E_{X-ray}/E_{radio}\sim10^{9}$,
$\gamma_{radio}-\gamma_{optical}<2.63\times10^{-9}$ at
$E_{optical}/E_{radio}\sim10^{5}$, and
$\gamma_{optical}-\gamma_{\gamma-ray}<3.03\times10^{-10}$ at
$E_{\gamma-ray}/E_{optical}\sim10^8$. This actually measures the arrival times
of freely-falling photons in the gravitational field of the Milky Way with the
largest amount of events and with data of the highest S/N, which tests WEP at
the energy band differences that has never been reached before.

distance which measures the difference between two metric spaces. To define the
distance, let us isometrically embed these spaces into various metric spaces
and measure the Hausdorff distance between their images. The best matching
corresponds to the least Hausdorff distance. The idea to compare metric spaces
in such a way was described in M.Gromov publications dating back to 1981. It
was shown that this distance being restricted to isometry classes of compact
metric spaces forms a metric which is now called Gromov-Hausdorff metric.
However, whether M.Gromov was the first who introduced this metric? It turns
out that 6 years before these Gromov's works, in 1975, another mathematician,
namely, David Edwards published a paper in which he defined this metric in
another way. Also, Edwards found and proved the basic properties of the
distance. It seems unfair that almost no one mentions this Edwards's paper
including well-known specialists in metric geometry. The main goal of the

solved by binary classifiers, and finally the classification results are
combined following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies. In
this paper, an attempt has been made to classify lithology using a multiclass
SVM based framework using well logs as predictor variables. Here, the lithology
is classified into four classes such as sand, shaly sand, sandy shale and shale
based on the relative values of sand and shale fractions as suggested by an

neutron porosity, density, and P-sonic) and class information from four closely

testing sets. We have used one-against-all strategy to combine the results of
multiple binary classifiers. The reported results established the superiority
of multiclass SVM compared to other classifiers in terms of classification
accuracy. The selection of kernel function and associated parameters has also
been investigated here. It can be envisaged from the results achieved in this
study that the proposed framework based on multiclass SVM can further be used

gravity theory recently proposed by Eric Verlinde~\cite{Verlinde:2016toy}. We
consider two limiting cases: the dark mass of maximally anisotropic pressures
(Case I) and of isotropic pressures (Case II). Our analysis of perihelion
advancement of a planet shows that only Case I yields a viable theory. In this
case the metric outside a star of mass $M_*$ can be modeled by that of a
point-like global monopole whose mass is $M_*$ and a deficit angle $\Delta =
\sqrt{(2GH_0M_*)/(3c^3)}$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble rate and $G$ the Newton
constant. This deficit angle can be used to test the theory since light
exhibits additional bending around stars given by, $\alpha_D\approx
-\pi\Delta/2$. This angle is independent on the distance from the star and it
affects equally light and massive particles. The effect is too small to be
measurable today, but should be within reach of the next generation of high
resolution telescopes. Finally we note that the advancement of periastron of a
planet orbiting around a star or black hole, which equals $\pi\Delta$ per
period, can be also used to test the theory.

pass the National University Entrance Exam (Kankor). Kankor is very important
and requires further research as it is used as the only means to identify the
participant's competence and skills which leads to a qualified higher education
and manpower, employment opportunities, allocation of human capital in
appropriate fields of study, and leading to a more specialized labor force in
the long run.
  Having a better picture of Kankor in Afghanistan is essential before
employing educational data mining techniques and other social and pedagogical
approaches to support the students and the educational institutions. Hence, the
author carried out a research on Kankor, in which he assessed and analyzed
Kankor from different angles. This research paper provides positive
contribution to the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), particularly, the
Kankor committee, and other educational institutions - introducing the
importance of data as an asset and a proper structure of recording and
producing data effective for research studies, paving the way for in-depth
descriptive and predictive analytics which improves the situation within the
context of the existing structural models in Afghanistan.
  The author's research target is to study Kankor using descriptive analytics
supported by Kankor Results Data (KRD) of 1.5 million records from 2003-2015,

  scattering a quantum particle on a one-dimensional potential barrier","8 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown that the Stone-von Neumann theorem is inapplicable to scattering
a quantum nonrelativistic particle on a one-dimensional ""short-range"" potential
barrier, since the unboundedness of the position operator plays here a crucial
role. The Shcr\""odinger representation associated with this process is
reducible: long before and long after the scattering event the space of its
asymptotes represents the direct sum of the subspaces of left and right
asymptotes. There is a dichotomous-context-induced superselection rule (SSR),
in which the role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix
$\sigma_3$ and the role of superselection (coherent) sectors is played by the
above subspaces. By the SSR any superposition of states from different coherent
sectors is a mixed state, and splitting the incident wave packet into the
transmitted and reflected parts is nothing but a conversion of a pure state
into a mixed one. The average values of any observable can be defined only for
the transmission and reflection subprocesses. The former evolves within a
single coherent sector of the Hilbert space, in the momentum representation;
while the latter evolves within a single coherent sector of this space, in the
coordinate representation.

single receivers in the focal point of one or more physical reflectors. Because
of this, most astronomical data sets were small enough that the raw data could
easily be downloaded and processed on a single machine.
  In the last decade, several large, complex Radio Astronomy instruments have
been built and the SKA is currently being designed. Many of these instruments
have been designed by international teams, and, in the case of LOFAR span an
area larger than a single country. Such systems are ICT telescopes and consist
mainly of complex software. This causes the main operational issues to be
related to the ICT systems and not the telescope hardware. However, it is
important that the operations of the ICT systems are coordinated with the
traditional operational work. Managing the operations of such telescopes
therefore requires an approach that significantly differs from classical
telescope operations.
  The goal of this session is to bring together members of operational teams
responsible for such large-scale ICT telescopes. This gathering will be used to
exchange experiences and knowledge between those teams. Also, we consider such
a meeting as very valuable input for future instrumentation, especially the SKA
and its regional centres.
