understanding the effectiveness of instruction and issues of equity in college
STEM courses. Our investigation focused on the implications on claims about
student learning that result from choosing between one of two commonly used
methods for analyzing shifts in concept inventories. The methods are: Hake's
gain (g), which is the most common method used in physics education research
and other discipline based education research fields, and Cohen's d, which is
broadly used in education research and many other fields. Data for the analyses
came from the Learning Assistant Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) database
and included test scores from 4,551 students on physics, chemistry, biology,
and math concept inventories from 89 courses at 17 institutions from across the
United States. We compared the two methods across all of the concept
inventories. The results showed that the two methods led to different
inferences about student learning and equity due to g being biased in favor of
high pretest populations. Recommendations for the analysis and reporting of
findings on student learning data are included.

intimately connected to the topology of the underlying control landscape. For
several common quantum control goals, including the maximization of an
observable expectation value, the landscape has been shown to lack local optima
if three assumptions are satisfied: (i) the quantum system is controllable,
(ii) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the evolution operator
is full-rank, and (iii) the control field is not constrained. In the case of
the observable objective, this favorable analysis shows that the associated
landscape also contains saddles, i.e., critical points that are not local
suboptimal extrema. In this paper, we investigate whether the presence of these
saddles affects the trajectories of gradient-based searches for an optimal
control. We show through simulations that both the detailed topology of the
control landscape and the parameters of the system Hamiltonian influence
whether the searches are attracted to a saddle. For some circumstances with a
special initial state and target observable, optimizations may approach a
saddle very closely, reducing the efficiency of the gradient algorithm.
Encounters with such attractive saddles are found to be quite rare. Neither the
presence of a large number of saddles on the control landscape nor a large
number of system states increase the likelihood that a search will closely
approach a saddle. Even for applications that encounter a saddle, well-designed
gradient searches with carefully chosen algorithmic parameters will readily
locate optimal controls.

recessive, assessing the phenotype differences based on summary statistics,
reported for individual studies in a meta-analysis, is a valid strategy.
However, when the genetic model is additive, a similar strategy based on

that the initial data is arbitrary (and therefore not necessarily in the range
of the forward operator). We prove that the inverse scale space flow is
guaranteed to return a singular vector if the data satisfies a novel dual
singular vector condition. We conclude the paper with numerical results that
validate the theoretical results and that demonstrate the importance of the
additional conditions required to guarantee the decomposition result.

condition expresses decomposition. It is a general framework for incidence
(co)algebras. In the present contribution, after establishing a formula for the
section coefficients, we survey a large supply of examples, emphasising the
notion's firm roots in classical combinatorics. The first batch of examples,
similar to binomial posets, serves to illustrate two key points: (1) the
incidence algebra in question is realised directly from a decomposition space,
without a reduction step, and reductions are often given by CULF functors; (2)
at the objective level, the convolution algebra is a monoidal structure of
species. Specifically, we encounter the usual Cauchy product of species, the
shuffle product of L-species, the Dirichlet product of arithmetic species, the
Joyal-Street external product of q-species and the Morrison `Cauchy' product of
q-species, and in each case a power series representation results from taking
cardinality. The external product of q-species exemplifies the fact that
Waldhausen's S-construction on an abelian category is a decomposition space,
yielding Hall algebras. The next class of examples includes Schmitt's chromatic
Hopf algebra, the Fa\`a di Bruno bialgebra, the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf
algebra of trees and several variations from operad theory. Similar structures
on posets and directed graphs exemplify a general construction of decomposition
spaces from directed restriction species. We finish by computing the M\""obius
function in a few cases, and commenting on certain cancellations that occur in
the process of taking cardinality, substantiating that these cancellations are

mechanical modes, the addition of laser cooling via sideband-resolved damping
of the mechanical mode of a chosen parity also damps and modifies the response
of the bulk modes of the same parity. This, in turn, simultaneously improves
the quality factor and reduces the thermal load of the counter-propagating
high-Q modes, leading to the dynamical creation of a cold phononic shield. We

field impulse, multiple solitonic structures get excited. The excitations of
the multiple solitons are similar to the experimental observations reported
recently by Boruah et al. [Phys. Plasmas 23, 093704 (2016)] for dusty plasmas.
The role of coupling parameter has also been investigated here, which shows
that with increasing coupling parameter, the amplitude of the solitonic pulse
increases whereas its width decreases.

incurs a high computational burden which limits its application on many
resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we address the problem of
performing real-time localization in large-scale 3D point cloud maps of
ever-growing size. While most systems using multi-modal information reduce
localization time by employing side-channel information in a coarse manner (eg.
WiFi for a rough prior position estimate), we propose to inter-weave the map
with rich sensory data. This multi-modal approach achieves two key goals
simultaneously. First, it enables us to harness additional sensory data to
localise against a map covering a vast area in real-time; and secondly, it also
allows us to roughly localise devices which are not equipped with a camera. The
key to our approach is a localization policy based on a sequential Monte Carlo
estimator. The localiser uses this policy to attempt point-matching only in
nodes where it is likely to succeed, significantly increasing the efficiency of
the localization process. The proposed multi-modal localization system is
evaluated extensively in a large museum building. The results show that our
multi-modal approach not only increases the localization accuracy but
significantly reduces computational time.

topologically non-trivial has unveiled distinct phases of electronic matter
with novel properties. Recently, mechanical lattices have been found to have
similarly rich structure in their phononic excitations, giving rise to
protected uni-directional edge modes whose existence was demonstrated in
lattices of interacting gyroscopes and coupled pendula. In all these cases,
however, as well as in other topological metamaterials, the underlying
structure was finely tuned, be it through periodicity, quasi-periodicity or
isostaticity. Here we show that amorphous mechanical Chern insulators
consisting of interacting gyroscopes can be readily constructed from arbitrary
underlying structures, including hyperuniform, jammed, quasi-crystalline, and
uniformly random point sets. While our findings apply to mechanical and
electronic systems alike, we focus on networks of interacting gyroscopes as a

the frequency of the emitted wave), we present a multiple-scale asymptotic
analysis of the moving-boundary problem for the linear wave equation. We obtain
a closed-form leading-order (with respect to the latter small parameter)
solution and show that the variable velocity of the boundary results not only
in frequency modulation but also in amplitude modulation of the received

tenets of the theory of a moving source on a stationary domain, specifically
that (a) $\dot X_\mathrm{s}$ for non-uniform boundary motion can be inserted in

the wave. The specific examples of decelerating and oscillatory boundary motion
are worked out and illustrated.

$(x,y)$, there is a path from $x$ to $y$ such that the Euclidean distance to
$y$ decreases monotonically at every vertex of the path. Greedy drawings
support a simple geometric routing scheme, in which any node that has to send a
packet to a destination ""greedily"" forwards the packet to any neighbor that is
closer to the destination than itself, according to the Euclidean distance in
the drawing. In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this
routing scheme is guaranteed to succeed.
  In 2004 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy
drawings. The $\textit{greedy embedding conjecture}$ states that every
$3$-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The $\textit{convex greedy
embedding conjecture}$ asserts that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a
planar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons. In
2008 the greedy embedding conjecture was settled in the positive by Leighton
and Moitra.
  In this paper we prove that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a
$\textit{planar}$ greedy drawing. Apart from being a strengthening of Leighton
and Moitra's result, this theorem constitutes a natural intermediate step
towards a proof of the convex greedy embedding conjecture.

increasing chain length, there is substantial deviation in the molecular size

the NGMM kernel can be efficiently linearized through (e.g.,) generalized
consistent weighted sampling (GCWS), as empirically validated in our study.
Owing to the discrete nature of hashed values, it also provides a scheme for

of the most relevant model parameters, that are the neutrino Yukawa coupling
matrix $Y_\nu$ and the right-handed mass matrix $M_R$, which is very convenient
for a phenomenological analysis. This $Y_\nu$ matrix, being generically
nondiagonal in flavor space, is the only responsible for the induced charged
lepton flavor violating processes of our interest. We perform the calculation
of the decay amplitude up to order ${\cal O}(Y_\nu^2+Y_\nu^4)$. We also study
numerically the goodness of the mass insertion approximation results. In the
last part we present the computation of the relevant one-loop effective vertex
$H\ell_i\ell_j$ for the lepton flavor violating Higgs decay which is derived
from a large $M_R$ mass expansion of the form factors. We believe that our
simple formula found for this effective vertex can be of interest for other
researchers who wish to estimate the $H \to \ell_i \bar \ell_j$ rates in a fast
way in terms of their own preferred input values for the relevant model
parameters $Y_\nu$ and $M_R$.

  including two related mappings. This revision contains new results and also a
  reorganization of topics",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Every regular N-gon generates a canonical family of regular polygons which
are conforming to the bounds of the 'star polygons' determined by N. These star
polygons are formed from truncated extended edges of the N-gon and the
intersection points ('star' points) determine a scaling which defines the
parameters of the family. In 'First Families of Regular Polygons'
(arXiv:1503.05536) we showed that this scaling forms a basis for the maximal
real subfield of the cyclotomic field of N. The traditional generator for this
subfield is 2cos(2Pi/N) so it has order Phi(N)/2 where Phi is the Euler totient
function. This order is known as the 'algebraic complexity' of N. The family of
regular polygons shares this same scaling and complexity, so members of this
family are an intrinsic part of any regular polygon - and we call them the
First Family of N.
  Here we start from first principles and give a formal derivation of the First
Families showing how each star[k] point of N defines a scale[k] and also an
S[k] 'tile' of the family. Under a piecewise isometry such as the
outer-billiards map the 'singularity set' W can be formed by iterating the
extended edges of N and we show that W can be reduced to a 'shear and rotation'
which preserves the S[k], so the 'web' W can be regarded as the disjoint union
(coproduct) of the local webs of the S[k]. These local webs are still very
complex but we show in Lemma 4.1 that the center of each S[k] has a constant
step-k orbit around N. These 'resonant' orbits set bounds on global orbits and
establish a connection between geometry and dynamics. We can now make
predictions about the geometry of the S[1] and S[2] tiles on the edges of N and
give a plausible explanation for the '4k+1' conjecture of arXiv:1311.6763 about
extended families of tiles when N = 8k+2. Each 8k+j family has unique edge
geometry and this geometry is shared by neighboring S[k] tiles.

based on fitting the energy functional dependence of published quantum
collisional rate coefficients of several neutral elements (BeI, NaI, MgI, AlI,
SiI and CaI) using simple polynomial equations. We perform thorough NLTE
abundance calculation tests using our method for four different atoms, Na, Mg,
Al and Si, for a broad range of stellar parameters. We then compare the results
to calculations computed using the published quantum rates for all the
corresponding elements. We also compare to results computed using excitation
collisional rates via the commonly used Drawin equation for different fudge
factors, SH, applied. We demonstrate that our proposed method is able to
reproduce the NLTE abundance corrections performed with the quantum rates for
different spectral types and metallicities for representative NaI and AlI lines
to within $\le$0.05 dex and %\le%0.03 dex, respectively. For MgI and SiI lines,
the method performs better for the cool giants and dwarfs, while larger
discrepancies up to 0.2 dex could be obtained for some lines for the subgiants
and warm dwarfs. We obtained larger NLTE correction differences between models
incorporating Drawin rates relative to the quantum models by up to 0.4 dex.
These discrepancies are potentially due to ignoring either or both CT and
ionization collisional processes by hydrogen in our Drawin models. Our
empirical fitting method performs well in its ability to reproduce, within
narrow uncertainties, the abundance corrections computed with models
incorporating quantum collisional rates. It could possibly be extended to other
transitions or in the absence of published quantum calculations, to other
elements as well.

from a prior with full support is admissible, and every admissible procedure is
Bayes. This relationship already breaks down once we move to finite-dimensional
Euclidean parameter spaces. Compactness and strong regularity conditions
suffice to repair the relationship, but without these conditions, admissible
procedures need not be Bayes. Under strong regularity conditions, admissible
procedures can be shown to be the limits of Bayes procedures. Under even
stricter conditions, they are generalized Bayes, i.e., they minimize the Bayes
risk with respect to an improper prior. In both these cases, one must venture
beyond the strict confines of Bayesian analysis. Using methods from
mathematical logic and nonstandard analysis, we introduce the class of
nonstandard Bayes decision procedures---namely, those whose Bayes risk with
respect to some prior is within an infinitesimal of the optimal Bayes risk.
Among procedures with finite risk functions, we show that a decision procedure
is extended admissible if and only if its nonstandard extension is nonstandard
Bayes. For problems with continuous risk functions defined on metric parameter
spaces, we derive a nonstandard analogue of Blyth's method that can be used to
establish the admissibility of a procedure. We also apply the nonstandard
theory to derive a purely standard theorem: when risk functions are continuous
on a compact Hausdorff parameter space, a procedure is extended admissible if

SDPs. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy
in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory,
where previously no $\omega(1)$-round integrality gaps were known: the set of
separable (i.e. unentangled) states, or equivalently, the $2 \rightarrow 4$
norm of a matrix, and the set of quantum correlations; i.e. conditional
probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared
entangled state. In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on
computational assumptions such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which
asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to solve. Our unconditional
results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for
separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum
correlations). In some cases we can make use of the framework of
Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for any SDP, not
only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a
dimension lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of
Watrous and Aaronson et al. These results can be viewed as limitations on the

peak at ~-14 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity, suggesting that they
are mostly formed outwards from ~20R*. The hot lines are centered at -10 km/s

emission of a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope. The analysis of
several scenarios reveal that the C2H4 abundance relative to H2 in the range
5-20R* is 6.9E-8 in average and it could be as high as 1.1E-7. Beyond 20R*, it
is 8.2E-8. The total column density is 6.5(3.0)E15 cm^-2. C2H4 is found to be
rotationally under local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and vibrationally
out of LTE. One of the scenarios that best reproduce the observations suggests
that up to 25% of the C2H4 molecules at 20R* could condense onto dust grains.

description of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. When Noether symmetries associated
with Killing vectors or tensors are present in geodesic flows, they lead to
constants of motion polynomial in the momenta. We generalize these concepts to
hydrodynamic flows. Moreover, the Hamiltonian descriptions of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics allow one to cast the evolution equations into a
hyperbolic form useful for evolving rotating or binary compact objects with
magnetic fields in numerical general relativity. Conserved circulation laws,
such as those of Kelvin, Alfv\'en and Bekenstein-Oron, emerge simply as special
cases of the Poincar\'e-Cartan integral invariant of Hamiltonian systems. We
use this approach to obtain an extension of Kelvin's theorem to baroclinic
(non-isentropic) fluids, based on a temperature-dependent time parameter. We
further extend this result to perfectly or poorly conducting baroclinic
magnetoflows. Finally, in the barotropic case, such magnetoflows are shown to
also be geodesic, albeit in a Finsler (rather than Riemann) space.

to a set of (Einstein) field equations that determine the gravitational field,
and to the geodesic equations that describe light propagation and the motion of
particles on the background. But open questions remain, including: What is the
scale on which matter and geometry are dynamically coupled in the Einstein
equations? Are the field equations valid on small and large scales? What is the
largest scale on which matter can be coarse grained while following a geodesic
of a solution to Einstein's equations? We address these questions. If the field
equations are causal evolution equations, whose average on cosmological scales
is not an exact solution of the Einstein equations, then some simplifying
physical principle is required to explain the statistical homogeneity of the
late epoch Universe. Such a principle may have its origin in the dynamical
coupling between matter and geometry at the quantum level in the early
Universe. This possibility is hinted at by diverse approaches to quantum
gravity which find a dynamical reduction to two effective dimensions at high
energies on one hand, and by cosmological observations which are beginning to
strongly restrict the class of viable inflationary phenomenologies on the
other. We suggest that the foundational principles of general relativity will
play a central role in reformulating the theory of spacetime structure to meet
the challenges of cosmology in the 21st century.

cavity are able to incorporate Ag atoms from an Ag(110) surface thus creating
silver-phthalocyanine (AgPc). The reaction was investigated by means of
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultrahigh vacuum, and the metalation
of \ce{H2Pc} at the interface was confirmed with X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. Three different kinds of molecules were found on the surface that
are assigned to H2Pc, the corresponding dehydrogenated molecules (Pc) and AgPc.
The relative amounts of Pc and AgPc increase with increasing annealing
temperature. We suggest that the reaction with Ag atoms from the steps of the
surface occurs favorably only for already dehydrogenated molecules; thus, the
metalation of H2Pc is likely limited by the heat-induced dehydrogenation.
Density functional theory simulations of the reaction path are presented to
corroborate this hypothesis.

polluted by heavy elements accreted from a debris disk. Such debris disks
result from the tidal disruption of rocky planetesimals which had survived to
whole stellar evolution from the main sequence to the final white dwarf stage.
Determining the accretion rate of this material is an important step towards
estimating the mass of the planetesimals and towards understanding the ultimate
fate of the planetary systems. The accretion of heavy material with a mean
molecular weight, $\mu$, higher than the mean molecular weight of the white
dwarf outer layers, induces a double-diffusive instability producing fingering
convection and extra-mixing. As a result, the accreted material is diluted deep
into the star. We explore the effect of this extra-mixing on the abundance
evolution of Mg, O, Ca, Fe and Si in the cases of the two well studied polluted
DAZ white dwarfs: GD~133 and G~29-38. We performed numerical simulations of the
accretion of material with a chemical composition similar to the bulk Earth
one. We considered accretion rates from $10^{4}$~g/s to $10^{10}$~g/s. The
double-diffusive instability develops on a very short time scale. The accretion
rate needed to reproduce the observed abundances exceeds by more than 2 orders
of magnitude the rate estimated by neglecting the fingering convection in the
case of GD~133, and by approximately 1.7 dex in the case of G~29-38. Our
numerical simulations show that fingering convection is an efficient mechanism
to mix the accreted material and that it must be taken into account in the

forces the self-energy corrections to be sector-dependent; in particular, the
highest sector has no self-energy correction. Thus, the bare mass can be
considered sector dependent as well. We find that, although higher Fock sectors

nonlinear CWENO reconstruction yields a high order accurate and essentially
non-oscillatory polynomial that is defined everywhere in the cell. Compared to
other WENO schemes on unstructured meshes, the total stencil size is the
minimum possible one, as in classical point-wise WENO schemes of Jiang and Shu.
However, the linear weights can be chosen arbitrarily, which makes the
practical implementation on general unstructured meshes particularly simple. We
make use of the piecewise polynomials generated by the CWENO reconstruction
operator inside the framework of fully discrete and high order accurate
one-step ADER finite volume schemes on fixed Eulerian grids as well as on
moving Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) meshes. The computational efficiency
of the high order finite volume schemes based on the new CWENO reconstruction

The framework enables the automatic verification of properties regarding both
the authorisations enforced by single policies and the relationships among
multiple policies. Effectiveness and performance of the analysis rely on a
semantic-preserving representation of FACPL policies in terms of SMT formulae
and on the use of efficient SMT solvers. Our analysis approach explicitly
addresses some crucial aspects of policy evaluation, as e.g. missing

other proposals. The framework is supported by Java-based tools, among which an
Eclipse- based IDE offering a tailored development and analysis environment for
FACPL policies and a Java library for policy enforcement. We illustrate the
framework and its formal ingredients by means of an e-Health case study, while
its effectiveness is assessed by means of performance stress tests and

law and they tend to be clustered in time. The second regularity, known as
volatility clustering, entails some predictability in the price changes: while
their sign is uncorrelated in time, their amplitude (or volatility) is
long-range correlated. Many models have been proposed to account for these
regularities, notably agent-based models; but these models often invoke
relatively complicated mechanisms. This paper identifies a basic reason behind
volatility clustering: the impact of exogenous news on expectations. Indeed the
expectations of financial agents clearly vary with the advent of news; the
simplest way of modeling this idea is to assume the expectations follow a
random walk. We show that this random walk implies volatility clustering in a
generic way.

equilibria is predicted for CNT with the aid of 3D numerical tools. In addition
to having a low aspect ratio, CNT is characterized by a low magnetic field and
small plasma volume. Also, highly overdense plasmas were recently heated in CNT
by means of microwaves. These characteristics suggest that CNT might attain
relatively high values of plasma $\beta$ and thus be of use in the experimental
study of stellarator stability to high-$\beta$ instabilities such as ballooning
modes. As a first step in that direction, here the ballooning stability limit
is found numerically. Depending on the particular magnetic configuration we
expect volume-averaged $\beta$ limits in the range 0.9-3.0%, and possibly
higher, and observe indications of a second region of ballooning stability. As
the aspect ratio is reduced, stability is found to increase in some
configurations and decrease in others. Energy-balance estimates using
stellarator scaling laws indicate that the lower $\beta$ limit may be
attainable with overdense heating at powers of of 40 to 100 kW. The present
study serves the additional purpose of testing VMEC and other stellarator codes
at high values of $\beta$ and at low aspect ratios. For this reason, the study
was carried out both for free boundary, for maximum fidelity to experiment, as
well as with a fixed boundary, as a numerical test.

complex fluids, made up of polymer brushes tethered to planar surfaces immersed
in a solvent yield non monotonic behavior of the friction coefficient as a
function of the polymer grating density on the substrates, \Gamma, while the
viscosity shows a monotonically increasing dependence on \Gamma. This effect is
shown to be independent of the degree of polymerization, N, and the size of the
system. It arises from the composition and the structure of the first particle
layer adjacent to each surface that results from the confinement of the fluid.
Whenever such layers are made up of as close a proportion of polymer beads to
solvent particles as there are in the fluid, the friction coefficient shows a
minimum, while for disparate proportions the friction coefficient grows. At the
mushroom to brush transition (MBT) the viscosity scales with an exponent that
depends on the characteristic exponent of the MBT (6/5) and the solvent quality
exponent (\nu = 0.5, for theta solvent), but it is independent of the
polymerization degree (N). On the other hand, the friction coefficient at the
MBT scales as {\mu}~N^(6/5), while the grafting density at the MBT scales as
{\Gamma}~ N^(-6/5) when friction is minimal, in agreement with previous scaling
theories. We argue these aspects are the result of cooperative phenomena that
have important implications for the understanding of biological brushes and the
design of microfluidics devices, among other applications of current academic

polarimetric observations and calculated their projections onto white light
images observed by STEREO A and B. By combining the graduated cylindrical shell
(GCS) forward modeling with the PR method, we proposed a new GCS-PR method to
derive 3D parameters of a CME observed from a single perspective at Earth.
Comparisons between different methods show a good degree of consistence in the
derived 3D results.

of $F,$ and gave the concrete computations for some special quadratic fields
with small discriminant. After that, many examples for quadratic fields with
larger discriminants are given, and similar works also have been done for cubic
fields and for some special quartic fields with discriminants not large. In the
present paper, we investigate the case of more general imaginary cyclic quartic
field $F=\mathbb{Q}\Big(\sqrt{-(D+B\sqrt{D})}\Big)$ with class number one and
large discriminants. The key problem is how to decrease the huge theoretical
bound appearing in the computation to a manageable one and the main difficulty
is how to deal with the large-scale data emerged in the process of computation.
  To solve this problem we have established a general architecture for the
computation, in particular we have done the works:
  (1) the PARI's functions are invoked in C++ codes;
  (2) the parallel programming approach is used in C++ codes;
  (3) in the design of algorithms and codes, the object-oriented viewpoint is
used, so an extensible program is obtained.
  As an application of our program, we prove that $K_2\mathcal{O}_F$ is trivial
  in the following three cases: $B=1,D=2$ or $B=2, D=13$ or $B=2, D=29.$
  In the last case, the discriminant of $F$ is 24389, hence, we can claim that
our architecture also works for the computation of the tame kernel of a number
field with discriminant less than 25000.

to manipulate the transition between 0 and $\pi$ junction and explore charge

Furthermore, we find a coexistence of 0-type ABS and $\pi$-type ABS in the same

ABSs, the different natures of the two sets of ABSs are verified, being
consistent with the scenario of phase transition between the singlet and

The core maintenance problem requires to update the core numbers of vertices

We investigate the parallelism in the core update process when multiple edges
and vertices are inserted or deleted. Specifically, we discover a structure
called superior edge set, the insertion or deletion of edges in which can be
processed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, efficient
parallel algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core
maintenance respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms
are the first parallel ones for the fundamental core maintenance problem. The
algorithms show a significant speedup in the processing time compared with
previous results that sequentially handle edge and vertex insertions/deletions.
Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different types of real-world

apparently disappear during the spectral transition to the low/hard state. This
is also where the radio jet appears, motivating speculation that both wind and
jet are driven by different configurations of the same magnetic field. However,
these systems must also have thermal winds, as the outer disc is clearly
irradiated.We develop a predictive model of the absorption features from
thermal winds, based on pioneering work of Begelman et al 1983. We couple this
to a realistic model of the irradiating spectrum as a function of luminosity to
predict the entire wind evolution during outbursts. We show that the column
density of the thermal wind scales roughly with luminosity, and does not shut
off at the spectral transition, though its visibility will be affected by the
abrupt change in ionising spectrum. We re-analyse the data from H1743-322 which
most constrains the difference in wind across the spectral transition and show
that these are consistent with the thermal wind models.We include simple
corrections for radiation pressure, which allows stronger winds to be launched
from smaller radii. These winds become optically thick around Eddington, which
may even explain the exceptional wind seen in one observation of GRO J1655-40.
These data can instead be fit by magnetic wind models, but similar winds are
not seen in this or other systems at similar luminosities. Hence we conclude
that the majority (perhaps all) current data can be explained by thermal or
thermal-radiative winds.

a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise amino acid

where the total interaction $\psi_N$ is represented as the sum of one body and
pairwise interactions. A protein folding theory based on the random energy
model (REM) indicates that the equilibrium ensemble of natural protein
sequences is a canonical ensemble characterized by $\exp(-\Delta G_{ND}/k_B

constant, meaning $\psi_N = \Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s +$ constant, where $\Delta

examine interaction changes ($\Delta \psi_N$) due to single nucleotide
nonsynonymous mutations, and have found that the variance of their $\Delta
\psi_N$ over all sites hardly depends on the $\psi_N$ of each homologous
sequence, indicating that the variance of $\Delta G_N (= k_B T_s \Delta

$T_s$ is estimated from the ratio of the variance of $\Delta \psi_N$ to that of
a reference protein, which is determined by a direct comparison between
$\Delta\Delta \psi_{ND} (\simeq \Delta \psi_N)$ and experimental $\Delta\Delta
G_{ND}$. Based on the REM, glass transition temperature $T_g$ and $\Delta
G_{ND}$ are estimated from $T_s$ and experimental melting temperatures ($T_m$)
for 14 protein domains. The estimates of $\Delta G_{ND}$ agree well with their
experimental values for 5 proteins, and those of $T_s$ and $T_g$ are all within

processes, we prove that the equilibrium ensemble of sequences obeys a
Boltzmann distribution with $\exp(4N_e m(1 - 1/(2N)))$, where $m$ is Malthusian

satisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise
amino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with
$\exp(-\psi_N)$, where $\psi_N$ is represented as the sum of one body and
pairwise potentials. A protein folding theory indicates that homologous
sequences obey a canonical ensemble characterized by $\exp(-\Delta G_{ND}/k_B
T_s)$ or by $\exp(- G_{N}/k_B T_s)$ if an amino acid composition is kept
constant, where $\Delta G_{ND} \equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the
native and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is selective temperature. Thus,
$4N_e m (1 - 1/(2N))$, $-\Delta \psi_{ND}$, and $-\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s$ must
be equivalent to each other. Based on the analysis of the changes ($\Delta
\psi_N$) of $\psi_N$ due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous substitutions,
$T_s$, and then glass transition temperature $T_g$, and $\Delta G_{ND}$ are
estimated with reasonable values for 14 protein domains. In addition,
approximating the probability density function (PDF) of $\Delta \psi_N$ by a
log-normal distribution, PDFs of $\Delta \psi_N$ and $K_a/K_s$, which is the
ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, in all and in
fixed mutants are estimated. It is confirmed that $T_s$ negatively correlates
with the mean of $K_a/K_s$. Stabilizing mutations are significantly fixed by
positive selection, and balance with destabilizing mutations fixed by random
drift. Supporting the nearly neutral theory, neutral selection is not
significant.

  Degree of Master of Philosophy in Mathematics",,,,"math.SG math.AG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we study a class of special Lagrangian submanifolds of toric
Calabi-Yau manifolds and construct their mirrors using some techniques
developed in the SYZ programme. We present a justification on the conjecture on
the mirror construction of D- branes in Aganagic-Vafa [2]. We apply the
techniques employed in Chan-Lau-Leung [8] and Chan [6], which give the SYZ
mirror construction for D-branes. Recently, Chan-Lau-Leung [8] has given an
explicit mirror construction for toric Calabi-Yau manifolds as complex
algebraic varieties. Inspired by the SYZ transformation of D-branes in
Leung-Yau-Zaslow[29], Chan[6] has defined a generalised mirror construction for
a larger class of Lagrangian subspaces, which is important to our situation.
The results point towards a need for further quantum correction of the SYZ
transform for Lagrangian subspaces in order to recover physicists mirror
prediction of counting holomorphic discs in Ooguri-Vafa [34]. When compare to
physicists prediction of the Aganagic-Vafa mirror branes, such naive SYZ
transform fails to coincide with the prediction. The main reasons lies in the
fact that the SYZ transformation does not capture open Gromov-Witten invariants
of the A-brane. Through the special case of Aganagic-Vafa A-branes, we are able
to modify the SYZ transform that involves further quantum correction using
discs counting of the A-brane. However it is not known how such a modified SYZ
transform can be constructed and works in general. We believe that the explicit
formulas and computations in the special case we consider here can give hints
to the correct modification in general in future development of the SYZ
programme.

Drift between dust and gas has proven to be important as well as numerically
challenging. We provide simple benchmarking problems for dusty gas codes by
numerically solving the two-fluid dust-gas equations for steady, plane-parallel
shock waves. The two distinct shock solutions to these equations allow a
numerical code to test different forms of drag between the two fluids, the
strength of that drag and the dust to gas ratio. We also provide an
astrophysical application of J-type dust-gas shocks to studying the structure

analysis have been proposed, which mine existing codebases and automatically
learn heuristics for finding a cost-effective abstraction for a given analysis
task. Such approaches reduce the burden of the analysis designers, but they do
not remove it completely; they still leave the highly nontrivial task of
designing so called features to the hands of the designers. Our technique
automates this feature design process. The idea is to use programs as features
after reducing and abstracting them. Our technique goes through selected
program-query pairs in codebases, and it reduces and abstracts the program in
each pair to a few lines of code, while ensuring that the analysis behaves
similarly for the original and the new programs with respect to the query. Each
reduced program serves as a boolean feature for program-query pairs. This
feature evaluates to true for a given program-query pair when (as a program) it
is included in the program part of the pair. We have implemented our approach
for three real-world program analyses. Our experimental evaluation shows that
these analyses with automatically-generated features perform comparably to
those with manually crafted features.

that the best-fitting nonlinear relations are better than the linear ones and
recommended to be applied in the measurement of SFRs. The systematic deviations

simulate micrometeorite impacts on aqueously altered minerals and observe their
spectral and physical evolution as a function of irradiation time. Irradiation
of the mineral lizardite, a Mg-phyllosilicate, produces little reddening and
darkening, but a pronounced reduction in band depths. Irradiation of an Fe-rich
aqueously altered mineral assemblage composed of cronstedtite, pyrite and
siderite, produces significant darkening and band depth suppression. The
spectral slopes of the Fe-rich assemblage initially redden then become bluer
with increasing irradiation time. Analyses of the Fe-rich assemblage using
scanning and transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of micron
sized carbon-rich particles that contain notable fractions of nitrogen and
oxygen. Radiative transfer modeling of the Fe-rich assemblage suggests that
npFe0 particles result in the initial spectral reddening of the samples, but
the increasing production of micron sized carbon particles results in the
subsequent spectral bluing. The presence of npFe0 and possibly cronstedtite
likely promotes the synthesis of these organic-like compounds. These
experiments indicate that space weathering processes may enable organic
synthesis reactions on the surfaces of volatile-rich asteroids. Furthermore,
Mg- and Fe-rich aqueously altered minerals are dominant at different phases of
the alteration process. Thus, the contrasting spectral slope evolution between
the Fe- and Mg-rich samples in these experiments may indicate that space
weathering trends of volatile-rich asteroids have a compositional dependency
that could be used to determine the aqueous histories of asteroid parent
bodies.

spatio-temporal information carried in $3D$ skeleton sequences into three $2D$
images by encoding the joint trajectories and their dynamics into color
distribution in the images, referred to as Joint Trajectory Maps (JTM), and
adopts ConvNets to learn the discriminative features for human action
recognition. Such an image-based representation enables us to fine-tune
existing ConvNets models for the classification of skeleton sequences without
training the networks afresh. The three JTMs are generated in three orthogonal
planes and provide complimentary information to each other. The final
recognition is further improved through multiply score fusion of the three
JTMs. The proposed method was evaluated on four public benchmark datasets, the
large NTU RGB+D Dataset, MSRC-12 Kinect Gesture Dataset (MSRC-12), G3D Dataset
and UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset (UTD-MHAD) and achieved the
state-of-the-art results.

subsonic limit regime, i.e. $0<\varepsilon \ll 1$, the solution propagates
highly oscillatory waves in time and/or rapid outgoing initial layers in space
due to the singular perturbation in the Zakharov equation and/or the
incompatibility of the initial data. Specifically, the solution propagates
waves with $O(\varepsilon)$-wavelength in time and $O(1)$-wavelength in space
as well as outgoing initial layers in space at speed $O(1/\varepsilon)$. This
high oscillation in time and rapid outgoing waves in space of the solution
cause significant burdens in designing numerical methods and establishing error
estimates for KGZ. By adapting an asymptotic consistent formulation, we propose
a uniformly accurate finite difference method and rigorously establish two
independent error bounds at $O(h^2+\tau^2/\varepsilon)$ and
$O(h^2+\tau+\varepsilon)$ with $h$ mesh size and $\tau$ time step. Thus we
obtain a uniform error bound at $O(h^2+\tau)$ for $0<\varepsilon\le 1$. The
main techniques in the analysis include the energy method, cut-off of the
nonlinearity to bound the numerical solution, the integral approximation of the
oscillatory term, and $\varepsilon$-dependent error bounds between the
solutions of KGZ and its limiting model when $\varepsilon\to0^+$. Finally,
numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds.

the orbital harmonics ($f_4$, $f_6$, $f_9$, $f_{15}$) in the low frequency

exciton in the presence of dynamic disorder. We consider a one-dimensional
excitonic system that consists of two levels placed at regular intervals.
Detailed analytical calculations of line shape have been carried out by using
Kubo's stochastic Liouville equation (K-QSLE). We make use of the observation
that in the site representation, the Hamiltonian of our system with constant
off-diagonal coupling J is a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix (TDTM) whose
eigenvalues and eigen functions are known analytically. This identification is
particularly useful for long chains where the eigen values of TDTM help to
understand crossover between static and fast modulation limits. We summarize
the new results as follows. (i) In the slow modulation limit when the bath
correlation time is large, the effects of spatial correlation are not
negligible. Here the line shape is broadened and the number of peak increases
beyond the ones obtained from TDTM (constant off-diagonal coupling element J
and no fluctuation). (ii) However, in the fast modulation limit when the bath
correlation time is small, the spatial correlation is less important (iii)
Importantly, we find that the line shape can capture that quantum coherence
affects in the two limits differently.

that a magnetic field with a small component along the magnetic easy-axis melts
long-range order, revealing a bistable, strongly correlated spin state. Far

microscopic or close-range imaging, as the 3D information can further be used
in various applications. Due to limited depth of field at such small distances,
the defocus blur induced in images can provide information about the 3D shape
of the object. The task of `shape from defocus' (SFD), involves the problem of
estimating good quality 3D shape estimates from images with depth-dependent
defocus blur. While the research area of SFD is quite well-established, the
approaches have largely demonstrated results on objects with bulk/coarse shape
variation. However, in many cases, objects studied under microscopes often
involve fine/detailed structures, which have not been explicitly considered in
most methods. In addition, given that, in recent years, large data volumes are
typically associated with microscopy related applications, it is also important
for such SFD methods to be efficient. In this work, we provide an indication of
the usefulness of the Belief Propagation (BP) approach in addressing these
concerns for SFD. BP has been known to be an efficient combinatorial
optimization approach, and has been empirically demonstrated to yield good
quality solutions in low-level vision problems such as image restoration,
stereo disparity estimation etc. For exploiting the efficiency of BP in SFD, we
assume local space-invariance of the defocus blur, which enables the
application of BP in a straightforward manner. Even with such an assumption,
the ability of BP to provide good quality solutions while using non-convex
priors, reflects in yielding plausible shape estimates in presence of fine
structures on the objects under microscopy imaging.

in general, it is natural to ask: what is the prediction error of the

It
is widely accepted that flares are powered by magnetic reconnection in the

both of which are probably driven by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope
(MFR). Here we report an eruptive flare on 2016 March 23 observed by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The
extreme-ultraviolet imaging observations exhibit the clear rise and eruption of
an MFR. In particular, the observations reveal solid evidence for magnetic
reconnection from both the corona and chromosphere during the flare. Moreover,
weak reconnection is observed before the start of the flare. We find that the
preflare weak reconnection is of tether-cutting type and helps the MFR to rise
slowly. Induced by a further rise of the MFR, strong reconnection occurs in the
rise phases of the flare, which is temporally related to the MFR eruption. We
also find that the magnetic reconnection is more of 3D-type in the early phase,
as manifested in a strong-to-weak shear transition in flare loops, and becomes
more 2D-like in the later phase, as shown by the apparent rising motion of an
arcade of flare loops.

ingredients: (i) a high order implicit upwind Discontinuous Galerkin
approximation of the kinetic equations with easy-to-solve triangular linear
systems; (ii) a second order asymptotic-preserving time integration based on
symmetry arguments; (iii) a palindromic composition of the second order method
for achieving higher orders in time. The method is then tested at orders 2, 4
and 6. It is asymptotic-preserving with respect to the stiff relaxation and
accepts high CFL numbers.

long time using the observed spectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However,
these generally have relied on using a single photon in the highest energy
range. Furthermore, the search for LIV lags has been hindered by our ignorance
concerning the intrinsic time lag in different energy bands. GRB 160625B, the
only burst so far with a well-defined transition from $positive$ lags to
$negative$ lags provides a unique opportunity to put new constraints on LIV.
Using multi-photon energy bands we consider the contributions to the observed
spectral lag from both the intrinsic time lag and the lag by LIV effects, and
assuming the intrinsic time lag to have a positive dependence on the photon
energy, we obtain robust limits on LIV by directly fitting the spectral lag
data of GRB 160625B. Here we show that these robust limits on the quantum
gravity energy scales are $E_{\rm QG,1}\geq0.5\times10^{16}$ GeV for the
linear, and $E_{\rm QG,2}\geq1.4\times10^{7}$ GeV for the quadratic LIV
effects, respectively. In addition, we give for the first time a reasonable

nuclei studied by antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). The AMD studies in
these decades have uncovered novel types of clustering phenomena brought about
by the excess neutrons. Among them, this review focuses on the molecule-like
structure of unstable nuclei. One of the earliest discussions on the clustering
in unstable nuclei was made for neutron-rich Be and B isotopes. AMD
calculations predicted that the ground state clustering is enhanced or reduced
depending on the number of excess neutrons. Today, the experiments are
confirming this prediction as the change of the proton radii. Behind this
enhancement and reduction of the clustering, there are underlying shell effects
called molecular- and atomic-orbits. These orbits form covalent and ionic
bonding of the clusters analogous to the atomic molecules. It was found that
this ""molecular-orbit picture"" reasonably explains the low-lying spectra of Be
isotopes. The molecular-orbit picture is extended to other systems having
parity asymmetric cluster cores and to the three cluster systems. O and Ne
isotopes are the candidates of the former, while the $3\alpha$ linear chains in
C isotopes are the latter. For both subjects, many intensive studies are now in
progress. We also pay a special attention to the observables which are the
fingerprint of the clustering. In particular, we focus on the monopole and
dipole transitions which are recently regarded as good probe for the
clustering. We discuss how they have and will reveal the exotic clustering.

we introduce a method that detects novel outlier graph nodes by taking into
account the node data and edge data simultaneously to detect anomalies. We
model the problem as a community detection task, where outliers form a separate

Markov Random Field) for joint modeling of nodes and edges in the network to
compute Holistic Community Outliers (HCOutliers). Thus, our model presents a
natural setting for heterogeneous graphs that have multiple edges/relationships
between two nodes. EM (Expectation Maximization) is used to learn model
parameters, and infer hidden community labels. Experimental results on
synthetic datasets and the DBLP dataset show the effectiveness of our approach
for finding novel outliers from networks.

special-purpose resource states that are capable to perform a certain operation

preserving completely positive maps, more specifically probabilistic operations
including Clifford operations and Pauli measurements. We concentrate on $1 \to
m$ and $m \to 1$ operations, i.e. operations that map one input qubit to $m$
output qubits or vice versa. Examples of such operations include encoding and
decoding in quantum error correction, entanglement purification or entanglement
swapping. We provide a general framework to construct optimal resource states
for complex tasks that are combinations of these elementary building blocks.
All resource states only contain input and output qubits, and are hence of
minimal size. We obtain a stabilizer description of the resulting resource
states, which we also translate into a circuit pattern to experimentally
generate these states. In particular, we derive recurrence relations at the
level of stabilizers as key analytical tool to generate explicit (graph-)
descriptions of families of resource states. This allows us to explicitly
construct resource states for encoding, decoding and syndrome readout for
concatenated quantum error correction codes, code switchers, multiple rounds of
entanglement purification, quantum repeaters and combinations thereof (such as
resource states for entanglement purification of encoded states).

are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We model
these emission features in the infrared spectra of 69 PPDs around 14 T Tauri
and 55 Herbig Ae/Be stars in terms of astronomical-PAHs. For each PPD, we
derive the size distribution and the charge state of PAHs. We then examine the
correlations of the PAH properties (i.e., sizes and ionization fractions) with
the stellar properties (e.g., stellar effective temperature, luminosity, and
mass). We find that the characteristic size of PAHs shows a tendency of
correlating with the stellar effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) and
interpret this as the preferential photodissociation of small PAHs in systems
with higher $T_{\rm eff}$ of which the stellar photons are more energetic. In
addition, the PAH size shows a moderate correlation with the red-ward
wavelength-shift of the 7.7 $\mu$m PAH feature that is commonly observed in
disks around cool stars. The ionization fraction of PAHs does not seem to
correlate with any stellar parameters. This is because the charging of PAHs
depends on not only the stellar properties (e.g., $T_{\rm eff}$, luminosity)
but also the spatial distribution of PAHs in the disks. The mere negative
correlation between the PAH size and the stellar age suggests that continuous
replenishment of PAHs via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the
collisional grinding of planetesimals and asteroids is required to maintain the
abundance of small PAHs against complete destruction by photodissociation.

flares plays a key role in our understanding of many aspects of flare physics,
from the spatial distributions of hard X-ray emission and energy deposition in
the ambient atmosphere to global energetics. Historically the transport of
these particles has been largely treated through a deterministic approach, in
which first-order secular energy loss to electrons in the ambient target is
treated as the dominant effect, with second-order diffusive terms (in both
energy and angle) being generally either treated as a small correction or even
neglected. We here critically analyze this approach, and we show that spatial
diffusion through pitch-angle scattering necessarily plays a very significant
role in the transport of electrons. We further show that a satisfactory
treatment of the diffusion process requires consideration of non-local effects,
so that the electron flux depends not just on the local gradient of the
electron distribution function but on the value of this gradient within an
extended region encompassing a significant fraction of a mean free path. Our
analysis applies generally to pitch-angle scattering by a variety of
mechanisms, from Coulomb collisions to turbulent scattering. We further show
that the spatial transport of electrons along the magnetic field of a flaring
loop can be modeled rather effectively as a Continuous Time Random Walk with
velocity-dependent probability distribution functions of jump sizes and
occurrences, both of which can be expressed in terms of the scattering mean
free path.

Recent observational studies are revealing that cloud-cloud collisions may play
a role in high-mass star formation in several places in the Milky Way and the
Large Magellanic Cloud. The Trifid Nebula M20 is a well known galactic HII
region ionized by a single O7.5 star. In 2011, based on the CO observations
with NANTEN2 we reported that the O star was formed by the collision between
two molecular clouds ~0.3,Myr ago. Those observations identified two molecular
clouds towards M20, traveling at a relative velocity of 7.5 km/s. This velocity
separation implies that the clouds cannot be gravitationally bound to M20, but
since the clouds show signs of heating by the stars there they must be
spatially coincident with it. A collision is therefore highly possible. In this
paper we present the new CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 observations of the colliding
clouds in M20 performed with the Mopra and ASTE telescopes. The high resolution
observations revealed the two molecular clouds have peculiar spatial and
velocity structures, i.e., the spatially complementary distribution between the
two clouds and the bridge feature which connects the two clouds in velocity
space. Based on a new comparison with numerical models, we find that this
complementary distribution is an expected outcome of cloud-cloud collisions,
and that the bridge feature can be interpreted as the turbulent gas excited at
the interface of the collision. Our results reinforce the cloud-cloud collision
scenario in M20.

{\em divergence} of the expansion in $\alpha$. The perturbative corrections are
necessarily singular when expanding around free, \order{\alpha^0} $in$ and
$out$ states that have no overlap with finite-sized atomic wave functions.
Nevertheless, measurables such as binding energies do have well-behaved
expansions in powers of $\alpha$ (and $\log\alpha$).
  It is desirable to formulate the concept of ""lowest order"" for gauge theory
bound states such that higher order corrections vanish in the $\alpha \to 0$
limit. This may allow to determine a lowest order term for QCD hadrons which
incorporates essential features such as confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking, and thus can serve as the starting point of a useful perturbative
expansion.
  I discuss a ""Born"" (no loop, lowest order in $\hbar$) approximation. Born
level states are bound by gauge fields which satisfy the classical field
equations. Gauss' law determines a distinct field $A^0(\xv)$ for each
instantaneous position of the charges. A Poincar\'e covariant boundary
condition for the gluon field leads to a confining potential for $q\bar q$ and

the field of reinforcement learning. However, setting TD's $\lambda$ parameter,
which controls the timescale of TD updates, is generally left up to the
practitioner. We formalize the $\lambda$ selection problem as a bias-variance
trade-off where the solution is the value of $\lambda$ that leads to the
smallest Mean Squared Value Error (MSVE). To solve this trade-off we suggest
applying Leave-One-Trajectory-Out Cross-Validation (LOTO-CV) to search the
space of $\lambda$ values. Unfortunately, this approach is too computationally
expensive for most practical applications. For Least Squares TD (LSTD) we show
that LOTO-CV can be implemented efficiently to automatically tune $\lambda$ and
apply function optimization methods to efficiently search the space of
$\lambda$ values. The resulting algorithm, ALLSTD, is parameter free and our
experiments demonstrate that ALLSTD is significantly computationally faster
than the na\""{i}ve LOTO-CV implementation while achieving similar performance.

for multi-set data-fusion. In this paper, J-BSS is addressed from a tensorial
perspective. We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS,
a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can
be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled
rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined
DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically
via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this
algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless
case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization
based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the determini- stic and generic
uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their
CPD counterpart. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of
DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods,
with regards to uniqueness and accuracy.

result if the box is sufficiently distorted, the lattice is not admissible,

error term is sharp, and we provide examples in dimensions $2$ and $3$ using
continued fractions. We also establish a similar counting result for primitive

including intramolecular distortions and the molecule adsorbed onto graphene.
Calculations show a noticeable charge redistribution within the d-pentacene +
graphene system due to molecular distortion, as well as the formation of weak
$\pi$-bonds between the molecule and the substrate. Additionally, the effect of
the chemical modification of the terminal saturation with --H by --OH and =O is
checked to explore the possibility of ""levels engineering"". The imaginary part
of the dielectric function of d-pentacene in the ideal and distorted
conformations and the molecule adsorbed at graphene were calculated within the
random phase approximation. Results show that, even though molecular
distortions change apreciably the absorption spectrum of isolated d-pentacene,
the adsorbed molecule exhibits an optical spectrum which mimics quite much that

non-linear parabolic double obstacle problem posed in one spatial variable and
defined in an unbounded domain where several explicit properties and formulas
are obtained. The restatement of the problem in polar coordinates allows to
pose the problem in one spatial variable in a finite domain, avoiding some of
the technical difficulties of the numerical solution of the previous statement
of the problem. If high precision is required, the spectral numerical method
proposed becomes more efficient than simpler methods as finite differences for
example.

and time symmetric is presented. The part of the model which exhibits these
features is the set of collapse outcomes. These play the role of matter
distributed in space and time. It is argued that the dynamically collapsing
quantum state, which is both foliation dependent and follows a time-asymmetric
dynamics, is not fundamental: it represents a state of information about the
past matter distribution for the purpose of estimating the future matter
distribution. It is also argued from the point of view of collapse models that
both special and general relativistic considerations point towards a discrete
spacetime structure and that gravity may not need to be quantised to give a
theory that is consistent with quantum matter.

set collected during the multi-instrument campaign spanning from 2009 March 15
to 2009 August 1 which includes, among other instruments, MAGIC, VERITAS,
Whipple 10-m, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT and VLBA. We find an increase
in the fractional variability with energy, while no significant interband
correlations of flux changes are found in the acquired data set. The higher
variability in the very high energy (>100 GeV, VHE) gamma-ray emission and the
lack of correlation with the X-ray emission indicate that the highest-energy
electrons that are responsible for the VHE gamma-rays do not make a dominant
contribution to the ~1 keV emission. Alternatively, there could be a very
variable component contributing to the VHE gamma-ray emission in addition to
that coming from the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. The space of SSC
model parameters is probed following a dedicated grid-scan strategy, allowing
for a wide range of models to be tested and offering a study of the degeneracy
of model-to-data agreement in the individual model parameters. We find that
there is some degeneracy in both the one-zone and the two-zone SSC scenarios
that were probed, with several combinations of model parameters yielding a
similar model-to-data agreement, and some parameters better constrained than
others. The SSC model grid-scan shows that the flaring activity around 2009 May
22 cannot be modeled adequately with a one-zone SSC scenario, while it can be
suitably described within a two-independent-zone SSC scenario. The observation
of an electric vector polarization angle rotation coincident with the gamma-ray
flare from 2009 May 1 resembles those reported previously for low frequency
peaked blazars, hence suggesting that there are many similarities in the
flaring mechanisms of blazars with different jet properties.

present a generative, evolutionary model of protein structure and sequence that
is valid on a local length scale. The model concerns the local dependencies
between sequence and structure evolution in a pair of homologous proteins. The
evolutionary trajectory between the two structures in the protein pair is
treated as a random walk in dihedral angle space, which is modelled using a
novel angular diffusion process on the two-dimensional torus. Coupling sequence
and structure evolution in our model allows for modelling both ""smooth""
conformational changes and ""catastrophic"" conformational jumps, conditioned on
the amino acid changes. The model has interpretable parameters and is
comparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models, providing new
insights into the relationship between sequence and structure evolution. For
example, using the trained model we were able to identify an apparent
sequence-structure evolutionary motif present in a large number of homologous
protein pairs. The generative nature of our model enables us to evaluate its
validity and its ability to simulate aspects of protein evolution conditioned
on an amino acid sequence, a related amino acid sequence, a related structure

one-to-many mapping of vertex onto dimer configurations allows the free-fermion
solutions to be applied to the anisotropic dimer model on a square lattice
where the dimers are rotated by 45 degrees compared to their usual orientation.
This dimer model is exactly solvable in geometries of arbitrary finite size. In
this paper, we establish and solve inversion identities for dimers with
periodic boundary conditions on the cylinder. In the particle representation,
the local face tile operators give a representation of the fermion algebra and
the fermion particle trajectories play the role of nonlocal (logarithmic)
degrees of freedom. In a suitable gauge, the dimer model is described by the
Temperley-Lieb algebra with loop fugacity $\beta=2\cos\lambda=0$. At the
isotropic point, the exact solution allows for the explicit counting of 45
degrees rotated dimer configurations on a periodic $M\times N$ rectangular
lattice. We show that the modular invariant partition function on the torus is
the same as symplectic fermions and critical dense polymers. We also show that
nontrivial Jordan cells appear for the dimer Hamiltonian on the strip with
vacuum boundary conditions. We therefore argue that, in the continuum scaling
limit, the dimer model gives rise to a {\em logarithmic} conformal field theory
with central charge c=-2, minimal conformal weight $\Delta_{\text{min}}=-1/8$
and effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}=1$.

complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver
gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver

important role in determining impulsively generated wave trains, which have
often been invoked to account for quasi-periodic signals with quasi-periods of
order seconds in a considerable number of coronal structures. We conduct a
comprehensive eigenmode analysis, both analytically and numerically, on the
dispersive properties of sausage modes in pressureless tubes with three
families of continuous radial density profiles. We find a rich variety of the
dependence on the axial wavenumber $k$ of the axial group speed $v_{\rm gr}$.
Depending on the density contrast and profile steepness as well as on the
detailed profile description, the $v_{\rm gr}-k$ curves either possess or do
not possess cutoff wavenumbers, and they can behave in either a monotonical or
non-monotonical manner. With time-dependent simulations, we further show that
this rich variety of the group speed characteristics heavily influences the
temporal evolution and Morlet spectra of impulsively generated wave trains. In
particular, the Morlet spectra can look substantially different from ""crazy
tadpoles"" found for the much-studied discontinuous density profiles. We
conclude that it is necessary to re-examine available high-cadence data to look
for the rich set of temporal and spectral features, which can be employed to
discriminate between the unknown forms of the density distributions transverse

become an increasing area in bioinformatics. While many research on updates to
the structure of GO and on the annotation corpora have been made, the impact of
GO evolution on semantic similarities is quite unobserved. Here we extensively
analyze how GO changes that should be carefully considered by all users of
semantic similarities. GO changes in particular have a big impact on
information content (IC) of GO terms. Since many semantic similarities rely on
calculation of IC it is obvious that the study of these changes should be
deeply investigated. Here we consider GO versions from 2005 to 2014 and we
calculate IC of all GO Terms considering five different formulation. Then we
compare these results. Analysis confirm that there exists a statistically
significant difference among different calculation on the same version of the

difference among the results obtained with different GO version on the same IC
formula. Results evidence there exist a remarkable bias due to the GO evolution

region for the annihilation with pseudoscalar mediator and greater than 700 GeV
(200 GeV--1 TeV) for the annihilation with axialvector mediator, respectively,
at about 68% confidence level. The AMS-02 data require an effective dark matter

on learning successive representations followed by a decision layer. This is

ConvNets, where each layer forms one of such successive representations.
However, an alternative that can achieve the same goal is a feedback based
approach in which the representation is formed in an iterative manner based on

  We establish that a feedback based approach has several fundamental
advantages over feedforward: it enables making early predictions at the query

We observe that feedback networks develop a considerably different
representation compared to feedforward counterparts, in line with the
aforementioned advantages. We put forth a general feedback based learning
architecture with the endpoint results on par or better than existing
feedforward networks with the addition of the above advantages. We also
investigate several mechanisms in feedback architectures (e.g. skip connections

remarkable in light of evidence that we provide indicating that the above

time-irreversible but also reducible. To analyze its transient dynamics, we
introduce the sequence of the expected initial and pre-attachment distributions

temperature. As a result, we find the {configurations most likely to be
observed} in the process of aggregation for each cluster size. We examine the

energy minima for every cluster size. We show that both processes taking place
in the network, attachment and relaxation, lead to the dominance of icosahedral
packing in small (up to 14 atom) clusters.

electron wells can be formed due to a local reduction of electromagnetic zero
point energy. These wells are narrow, of the width $\sim 10^{-11}cm$, and with
the depth $\sim 1MeV$. Such anomalous states, from the formal standpoint of
quantum mechanics, correspond to a singular solution of a wave equation
produced by the non-physical $\delta(\vec R)$ source. The resolution, on the
level of the Standard Model, of the tiny region around the formal singularity
shows that the state is physical. The creation of those states in an atomic
system is of the formal probability $\exp(-1000)$. The probability becomes not
small under a perturbation which rapidly varies in space, on the scale
$10^{-11}cm$. In condensed matter such perturbation may relate to acoustic
shock waves. In this process the short scale is the length of the standing de
Broglie wave of a reflected lattice atom. Under electron transitions in the
anomalous well (anomalous atom) $keV$ X-rays are expected to be emitted. A

Each pair algebra-coalgebra characterizes, indeed, a QFT system and its
mirroring thermal bath, respectively, so to model dissipative quantum systems
persistently in far-from-equilibrium conditions, with an evident significance
also for biological sciences. The $q$-deformed Hopf Coalgebras and the
$q$-deformed Hopf Algebras constitute two dual categories because characterized
by the same functor $T$, related with the Bogoliubov transform, and by its
contravariant application $T^{op}$, respectively. The \textit{q}-deformation
parameter, indeed, is related to the Bogoliubov angle, and it is effectively a
thermal parameter. Therefore, the different values of $q$ identify univocally,
and then label, the vacua appearing in the foliation process of the quantum
vacuum. This means that, in the framework of Universal Coalgebra, as general
theory of dynamic and computing systems (""labelled state-transition systems""),
the so labelled infinitely many quantum vacua can be interpreted as the Final
Coalgebra of an ""Infinite State Black-Box Machine"". All this opens the way to
the possibility of designing a new class of universal quantum computing

revealed a wide collection of emergent patterns in living systems. Analyzing
different datasets, ranging from metabolic gene-regulatory to species
interaction networks, we find that these networks are sparse, i.e. the
percentage of the active interactions scales inversely proportional to the
system size. This puzzling characteristic has been neither yet considered nor
explained. Herein, we introduce the new concept of explorability, a measure of
the ability of the system to adapt to newly intervening changes. We show that
sparsity is an emergent property resulting from a variational principle aiming
at the optimization of both explorability and dynamical robustness, the
capacity of the system to remain stable after perturbations of the underlying
dynamics. Networks with higher connectivities lead to an incremental difficulty
to find better values for both the explorability and dynamical robustness,
associated with the fine-tuning of the newly added interactions. A relevant
characteristic of our solution is its scale invariance, that is, it remains
optimal when several communities are assembled togheter. Connectivity is also a
key ingredient determining ecosystem stability and our proposed solution
contributes to solving May's celebrated complexity-stability paradox.

very good error performance over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and

performance of BICM-ID can significantly be improved by employing
multi-dimensional (MD) modulation. However, suitable MD mappings are obtained
by computer search techniques except for MD modulations that use smaller
constellation e.g., binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK) and $8$-ary phase shift keying ($8$-PSK) as basic modulation. The
alphabet size of MD modulations increases exponentially as the order of the
basic modulation increases and computer search becomes intractable. In this
paper, we propose a systematic mapping method for MD modulations. The
innovativeness of our proposed method is that it generates MD mappings using
$16$- and $64$-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) very efficiently. The
