very active area of research. Recently, it was shown that these concepts are
equivalent. In this paper, we make a detailed study of a weakening of these
concepts to weak phase retrieval and weak phaseless reconstruction. We will
give several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for frames to have these
weak properties. We will prove three surprising results: (1) Weak phaseless
reconstruction is equivalent to phaseless reconstruction. I.e. It never was
""weak""; (2) Weak phase retrieval is not equivalent to weak phaseless
reconstruction; (3) Weak phase retrieval requires at least $2m-2$ vectors in an
m-dimensional Hilbert space. We also gives several examples illustrating the
relationship between these concepts.

first order necessary conditions for optimality; these necessary conditions
typically yield two point boundary value problems, and these boundary value
problems can then solved to extract optimal control trajectories. Constrained
optimal control problems for mechanical systems, in general, can only be solved
numerically, and this motivates the need to derive discrete-time models that
are accurate and preserve the non-flat manifold structures of the underlying
continuous-time controlled systems. The PMPs for discrete-time systems evolving
on Euclidean spaces are not readily applicable to discrete-time models evolving
on non-flat manifolds. In this article we bridge this lacuna and establish a
discrete-time PMP on matrix Lie groups. Our discrete-time models are derived
via discrete mechanics, (a structure preserving discretization scheme,) leading
to the preservation of the underlying manifold over time, thereby resulting in
greater numerical accuracy of our technique. This PMP caters to a class of
constrained optimal control problems that includes point-wise state and control
action constraints, and encompasses a large class of control problems that
arise in various field of engineering and the applied sciences.

neutron diffraction complemented by magnetisation measurements. In zero field,
HoB$_4$ shows magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\mathrm{N1}}$ = 7.1 K to an
incommensurate state with a propagation vector ($\delta$, $\delta$, $\delta'$),
where $\delta$ = 0.02 and $\delta'$ = 0.43 and at $T_{\mathrm{N2}}$ = 5.7 K to
a non-collinear commensurate antiferromagnetic structure. Polarised neutron
diffraction measurements in zero field have revealed that the incommensurate
reflections, albeit much reduced in intensity, persist down to 1.5 K despite
antiferromagnetic ordering at 5.7 K. At lower temperatures, application of a
magnetic field along the $c$-axis initially re-establishes the incommensurate
phase as the dominant magnetic state in a narrow field range, just prior to
HoB$_4$ ordering with an up-up-down ferrimagnetic structure characterised by
the $(h,k,\frac{1}{3})$-type reflections between 18 and 24 kOe. This field
range is marked by the previously reported $M/M_{\mathrm{sat}}$= $\frac{1}{3}$
magnetisation plateau, which we also see in our magnetisation measurements. The
region between 21 and 33 kOe is characterised by the increase in the intensity
of the antiferromagnetic reflections, such as (100), the maximum of which
coincides with the appearance of the narrow magnetisation plateau with
$M/M_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx$ $\frac{3}{5}$. Further increase of the magnetic
field results in the stabilisation of a polarised state above 33 kOe, while the
incommensurate reflections are clearly present in all fields up to 59 kOe. We
propose the $H-T$ phase diagram of HoB$_4$ for the $H \parallel c$ containing

simultaneous uneven illumination. To recover high-quality aerial image from its
non-uniform version, we propose a novel patch-wise restoration approach based
on a key observation that the degree of blurring is inevitably affected by the
illuminated conditions. A non-local Retinex model is developed to accurately
estimate the reflectance component from the degraded aerial image. Thereafter
the uneven illumination is corrected well. And then non-uniform coupled
blurring in the enhanced reflectance image is alleviated and transformed
towards uniform distribution, which will facilitate the subsequent deblurring.
For constructing the multi-scale sparsified regularizer, the discrete shearlet
transform is improved to better represent anisotropic image features in term of
directional sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, a new adaptive variant of
total generalized variation is proposed for the structure-preserving
regularizer. These complementary regularizers are elegantly integrated into an
objective function. The final deblurred image with uniform illumination can be
extracted by applying the fast alternating direction scheme to solve the
derived function. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can
not only remove both the space-varying illumination and motion blur in the
aerial image effectively but also recover the abundant details of aerial scenes
with top-level objective and subjective quality, and outperforms other
state-of-the-art restoration methods.

spin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gas with attractive interaction, loaded in a
two dimensional (2D) square optical lattice, in the presence of an effective
out-of-plane Zeeman field. Our numerical calculations show that the many body
physics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side is strongly modified
compared to the Fermi gases in the free space. The physics behind this
statement is in the fact that without a lattice structure, if the value of the
Zeeman field does not exceed some threshold value, the minimum of the
single-particle ground state energy is infinitely degenerate and occurs along a
ring in $(k_x,k_y)$ space. This reduces the effective dimensionality; the
single-particle density of states is a constant at low energies, and the
molecular pairing is strongly enhanced. In contrast to the continuum, in the 2D
lattice case there are only four degenerate minima, and because of that, the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in optical lattices gives rise to unusual properties
entirely different from the continuum. For example, in the continuum, the
pairing gap as well as the condensate fraction are strongly enhanced by the SOC
strength on the BCS side. In the presence of lattice geometry the gap and the
condensate fraction increase as a function of the SOC strength only at the
small fillings and weak attraction limit. Moreover, we found that the speed of
sound also exhibits different behavior: in the 3D and 2D continuum, the slope
of the Goldstone mode decreases as a function of the SOC strength, while in the
lattice case the speed of sound increases monotonically with SOC strength.

the gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have
proposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and
decoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when
the error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a
drastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks.
Furthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout

the global similarity correlations, which can adaptively capture both the
geometrical structures and discriminative features of textured patches. In
particular, edge weights in the graph are obtained by seeking a nonnegative
low-rank construction. Besides, a robust locality-constrained coding can
automatically preserve not only spatial neighborhood information but also
internal consistency present in noisy patches while learning overcomplete
dictionary. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves

The complete width problem is to decide whether the complete width of a given

We show that the complete width problem is NP-complete on $3K_2$-free bipartite
graphs and polynomially solvable on $2K_2$-free bipartite graphs and on
$(2K_2,C_4)$-free graphs. As a by-product, we obtain the following new results:
the edge clique cover problem is NP-complete on $\overline{3K_2}$-free
co-bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on $C_4$-free co-bipartite graphs

complete graphs which implies that the complete width problem admits a kernel
of at most $2^k$ vertices. This provides another proof for the known fact that
the edge clique cover problem admits a kernel of at most $2^k$ vertices.

are not attached to a larger organism and must often function in unregulated
and varied environments. We begin by uncovering a common organizational
principle -- Rentian scaling -- that manifests as hierarchical network layout
in both physical and topological space. Simulated models of distribution
networks optimized for transport in the presence of fluctuations are also shown
to exhibit this feature in their embedding, with similar scaling exponents.
However, we also find clear differences in how the fungi and vasculature
balance tradeoffs in material cost, efficiency, and robustness. While the
vasculature appear well optimized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency,
the fungi tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. These
differences may be driven by the distinct functions that each system must
perform, and the different habitats in which they reside. As a whole, this work
demonstrates that distribution networks contain a set of common, emergent
design features, as well as tailored optimizations.

cycles and cell lineages. Although reprogramming has been demonstrated
experimentally, much of the underlying processes governing cell fate decisions
remain unknown. This work aims to bridge this gap by modelling cell types as a
set of hierarchically related dynamical attractors representing cell cycles.
Stages of the cell cycle are characterised by the configuration of gene
expression levels, and reprogramming corresponds to triggering transitions
between such configurations. Two mechanisms were found for reprogramming in a
two level hierarchy: cycle specific perturbations and a noise-induced
switching. The former corresponds to a \emph{directed} perturbation that
induces a transition into a cycle state of a different cell type in the potency
hierarchy (mainly a stem cell) whilst the latter is a priori undirected and
could be induced, e.g., by a (stochastic) change in the cellular environment.
These reprogramming protocols were found to be effective in large regimes of
the parameter space and make specific predictions concerning reprogramming
dynamics which are broadly in line with experimental findings.

The decision variables here are the covariance matrices for the information
signals and ANs. However, the nonconvexity of each link's optimization problem
(i.e., best response) makes conventional convex games inapplicable, even to
find whether a Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists. To tackle this issue, we analyze
the proposed game using a relaxed equilibrium concept, called quasi-Nash
equilibrium (QNE). Under a constraint qualification condition for each player's
problem, the set of QNEs includes the NE of the proposed game. We also derive
the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the resulting QNE. It turns
out that the uniqueness conditions are too restrictive, and do not always hold
in typical network scenarios. Thus, the proposed game often has multiple QNEs,
and convergence to a QNE is not always guaranteed. To overcome these issues, we
modify the utility functions of the players by adding several specific terms to
each utility function. The modified game converges to a QNE even when multiple
QNEs exist. Furthermore, players have the ability to select a desired QNE that
optimizes a given social objective (e.g., sum-rate or secrecy sum-rate).
Depending on the chosen objective, the amount of signaling overhead as well as
the performance of resulting QNE can be controlled. Simulations show that due
to the QNE selection mechanism, we can achieve a significant improvement in
terms of secrecy sum-rate and power efficiency.

the energy consumed by these systems during their lifetime, and think about the
long-term consequences in the sustainability of our planet Earth. Indeed, once

mainly by the usage context. This means that the area of energy-efficient
software development needs green development lifecycles that provide
appropriate methodologies and tools to identify and analyze the energy hotspots

execution. Developers rarely address energy efficiency as some recent studies
show, mostly because they lack appropriate methodologies and tools that help
them to produce green software at runtime. So, although software energy
efficiency is becoming increasingly important in an ever more

closed-form expressions for the primary and secondary rates for all the

of meshes which are adapted to a scalar monitor function through

Monge-Amp\`ere equation for a scalar mesh potential. We adapt an existing
finite element scheme for the standard Monge-Amp\`ere equation to this mesh
generation problem; this is a mixed finite element scheme, in which an extra
discrete variable is introduced to represent the Hessian matrix of second
derivatives. The problem we consider has additional nonlinearities over the
basic Monge-Amp\`ere equation due to the implicit dependence of the monitor
function on the resulting mesh. We also derive the equivalent
Monge-Amp\`ere-like equation for generating meshes on the sphere. The finite

All numerical experiments are performed using the open-source finite element

this spectrum since it has been found that micrometer-sized metallic particles
can bond to metallic substrates under supersonic-impact conditions. However,
the mechanistic aspects of impact-induced adhesion are still unresolved. Here
we study supersonic impact of individual metallic microparticles on substrates
with micro-scale and nanosecond-level resolution. This permits the first direct
observation of a material-dependent threshold velocity, above which the
particle undergoes impact-induced material ejection and adheres to the
substrate. Our finite element simulations reveal that prevailing theories of
impact-induced shear localization and melting cannot account for the material
ejection. Rather, it originates from the propagation of a pressure wave induced
upon impact. The experiments and simulations together establish that the
critical adhesion velocity for supersonic microparticles is proportional to the

policies when the observed data lacks counter-factual information, is biased
and possesses many features. The approach is applicable in a wide variety of
settings from healthcare to advertising to education to finance. These settings
have in common that the decision maker can observe, for each previous instance,
an array of features of the instance, the action taken in that instance, and
the reward realized -- but not the rewards of actions that were not taken: the
counterfactual information. Learning in such settings is made even more
difficult because the observed data is typically biased by the existing policy
(that generated the data) and because the array of features that might affect
the reward in a particular instance -- and hence should be taken into account
in deciding on an action in each particular instance -- is often vast. The
approach presented here estimates propensity scores for the observed data,
infers counterfactuals, identifies a (relatively small) number of features that
are (most) relevant for each possible action and instance, and prescribes a
policy to be followed. Comparison of the proposed algorithm against the
state-of-art algorithm on actual datasets demonstrates that the proposed
algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance.

the help of a Euclidean effective action in one lower dimension, written in

in the ideal order constitutive relations of the superfluid surface, in both

coefficients entirely fixed in terms of the first order bulk transport

surface thermodynamics. In the process, we also evaluate the stationary first

$3+1$ dimensional Galilean superfluids via the null reduction of null

the Higgs mass is lifted to 125 GeV by a new tree-level superpotential

presumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized by the
flare. Line velocities however are much lower than expected from a stellar
disruption by supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than
expected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of a persistently active
galactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly
related to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use
exhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud
properties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large
HeII(4686A)/H$\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.
Although observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like
illumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths. We therefore
propose to explain these properties by a light-echo photoionization model: the
initial flash of a hot blackbody (detonation) excites BLR clouds, which are
then seen superimposed on continuum from a later, expanded, cooled stage of the
central luminous source. The implied cloud mass is substellar, which may be
inconsistent with a TDE. Given these and other inconsistencies with TDE models

origins for these nuclear flares, which we briefly discuss (e.g. nuclear

conditional expected shortfall (CES) associated with conditional distributions
of a series of returns on a financial asset. The return series and the
conditioning covariates, which may include lagged returns and other exogenous
variables, are assumed to be strong mixing and follow a nonparametric
conditional location-scale model. First stage nonparametric estimators for
location and scale are combined with a generalized Pareto approximation for
distribution tails proposed by Pickands (1975) to give final estimators for
CVaR and CES. We provide consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed
estimators under suitable normalization. We also present the results of a Monte
Carlo study that sheds light on their finite sample performance. Empirical
viability of the model and estimators is investigated through a backtesting
exercise using returns on future contracts for five agricultural commodities.

of non-classical photon number correlations in twin beams (TWB) states for many
applications, ranging from imaging to metrology. Photon number correlations in
the quantum regime are easy to be produced and are rather robust against
unavoidable experimental losses, and noise in some cases, if compared to the
entanglement, where loosing one photon can completely compromise the state and
its exploitable advantage. Here, we will focus on quantum enhanced protocols in
which only phase-insensitive intensity measurements (photon number counting)
are performed, which allow probing transmission/absorption properties of a
system, leading for example to innovative target detection schemes in a strong
background. In this framework, one of the advantages is that the sources
experimentally available emit a wide number of pairwise correlated modes, which
can be intercepted and exploited separately, for example by many pixels of a
camera, providing a parallelism, essential in several applications, like wide
field sub-shot-noise imaging and quantum enhanced ghost imaging. Finally,
non-classical correlation enables new possibilities in quantum radiometry, e.g.
the possibility of absolute calibration of a spatial resolving detector from
the on-off- single photon regime to the linear regime, in the same setup.

achieved by optical pumping of nitrogen vacancy centers followed by rapid cross
relaxation at the energy level matching condition in a 51 mT bias field. The
maximum observed donor spin polarization is 0.9 \% corresponding to an
enhancement by 25 compared to the thermal Boltzmann polarization. A further
accumulation of polarization is impeded by an anomalous optical saturation
effect that we attribute to charge state conversion processes. Hyperpolarized
nitrogen donors may form a useful resource for increasing the efficiency of
diamond-based dynamic nuclear polarization devices.

  Evolutionary Algorithm Tuned using a Novel Heuristic Method",,,,,"cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum inspired Evolutionary Algorithms were proposed more than a decade ago
and have been employed for solving a wide range of difficult search and
optimization problems. A number of changes have been proposed to improve
performance of canonical QEA. However, canonical QEA is one of the few
evolutionary algorithms, which uses a search operator with relatively large
number of parameters. It is well known that performance of evolutionary
algorithms is dependent on specific value of parameters for a given problem.
The advantage of having large number of parameters in an operator is that the
search process can be made more powerful even with a single operator without
requiring a combination of other operators for exploration and exploitation.
However, the tuning of operators with large number of parameters is complex and
computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel heuristic method for
tuning parameters of canonical QEA. The tuned QEA outperforms canonical QEA on
a class of discrete combinatorial optimization problems which, validates the
design of the proposed parameter tuning framework. The proposed framework can
be used for tuning other algorithms with both large and small number of tunable
parameters.

conventional KD regardless of the directions and sizes of the tip angle, while
the fluctuation in residence time stays at the same level as the conventional
KD. Furthermore, pitched tips of backward direction increase the mean applied

understandings of the role of the tip angle on KD can give a basic guide in
selecting and designing suitable angle parameters of ptKD for different mixing

parameter. Suppose the equation has a trivial solution branch
$\{(0,\lambda):\,\,\lambda\in R\}$. Denote $\Phi_\lambda$ the local semiflow
generated by the initial value problem of the equation. It is shown that if the
crossing number $n$ at a bifurcation value $\lambda=\lambda_0$ is nonzero and
moreover, $S_0=\{0\}$ is an isolated invariant set of $\Phi_{\lambda_0}$, then
either there is a one-sided neighborhood $I_1$ of $\lambda_0$ such that
$\Phi_\lambda$ bifurcates a topological sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ for each

$0\not\in K_\lambda$ for each $\lambda\in I_2\setminus\{\lambda_0\}$. We also
prove that the bifurcating invariant set has nontrivial Conley index. Building
upon this fact we establish a global dynamical bifurcation theorem. Roughly
speaking, we prove that for any given neighborhood $\Omega$ of the bifurcation
point $(0,\lambda_0)$, the connected bifurcation branch $\Gamma$ from

meets another bifurcation point $(0,\lambda_1)$. This result extends the

are interested in characterizing the maximum achievable spoofing rate of this
new spoofing channel, which is equivalent to the maximum achievable rate of the
target message at Bob, under the condition that Bob cannot decode the source
message from Alice. We propose a novel combined spoofing approach, where the
spoofer sends its own target message, combined with a processed version of the
source message to cancel the source message at Bob. For both cases when Bob
treats interference as noise (TIN) or applies successive interference
cancelation (SIC), we obtain the maximum achievable spoofing rates by
optimizing the power allocation between the target and source messages at the
spoofer.

quadrature phase shift keying faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and propose
two novel low-complexity sequence estimation techniques based on concepts of
successive interference cancellation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach in the literature to detect FTN signaling on a symbol-by-symbol
basis. In particular, based on the structure of the self-interference inherited
in FTN signaling, we first find the operating region boundary---defined by the
root-raised cosine (rRC) pulse shape, its roll-off factor, and the time
acceleration parameter of the FTN signaling---where perfect estimation of the
transmit data symbols on a symbol-by-symbol basis is guaranteed, assuming
noise-free transmission. For noisy transmission, we then propose a novel
low-complexity technique that works within the operating region and is capable
of estimating the transmit data symbols on a symbol-by-symbol basis. To reduce
the error propagation of the proposed successive symbol-by-symbol sequence
estimator (SSSSE), we propose a successive symbol-by-symbol with go-back-$K$
sequence estimator (SSSgb$K$SE) that goes back to re-estimate up to $K$
symbols, and subsequently improves the estimation accuracy of the current data
symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed sequence estimation
techniques perform well for low intersymbol interference (ISI) scenarios and
can significantly increase the data rate and spectral efficiency. Additionally,
results reveal that choosing the value of $K$ as low as $2$ or $3$ data symbols
is sufficient to significantly improve the bit-error-rate performance. Results
also show that the performance of the proposed SSSgb$K$SE, with $K = 1$ or $2$,
surpasses the performance of the lowest complexity equalizers reported in the

  In contrast, the main result of this article operates as a black box which

this paper we study different numerical approaches to solving this equation.
Previous ideas gave good results in the strong coupling region. Here we propose
an alternative method based on the observation that certain matrices
$\hat{\rho}$ of Wilson loop expectation values are positive definite. They also
have unit trace ($\hat{\rho}\succeq 0, \mbox{tr} \hat{\rho}=1$), in fact they
can be defined as density matrices in the space of open loops after tracing

  The condition that such matrices are positive definite allows us to study the
weak coupling region which is relevant for the continuum limit. In the exactly
solvable case of two dimensions this approach gives very good results by
considering just a few loops. In four dimensions it gives good results in the
weak coupling region and therefore is complementary to the strong coupling
expansion. We compare the results with standard Monte Carlo simulations.

transport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration
interaction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we obtain
master equation and compute the distribution of waiting times for electron
transport. The details of waiting time distributions are used to elucidate
microscopic mechanism of electron transport and the role of electron-vibration
interactions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction,
the skewness and dispersion of the waiting time distribution experience
stepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are
associated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons.
In the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease
dominates over all other changes in the waiting time distribution as the
molecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium.

vacuum energy density $\rho_{v}$, is expected to depend on the coupling between
the UV scale $\ell_\mathrm{\textsf{UV}}$ and spacetime curvature. We determine
this coupling in an arbitrary freely falling frame characterised by it's
geodesic tangent $U^i(\tau)$. We show that local vacuum modes within a small
causal diamond based on $U^i(\tau)$, whose size is set by wavelength of the
modes, generically give a contribution $\rho_{0}$ to $\rho_v$ which, to leading
order, scales as: $\rho_{0} = \left( \pi \hbar c/2 \right) {\mathrm{\textsf R}}
\, {\ell_\mathrm{\textsf{UV}}}^{-2}$, where the curvature term $\mathrm{\textsf
R}=\alpha R_{ab} U^a U^b + \beta R$, and $(\alpha, \beta) \in \mathbb{R}$ are
constants. The genericness of this result arises from the fact that, although
the modes may reduce to Minkowski plane waves along $U^i(\tau)$, the
stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$, since it depends on derivatives of the modes,
does not reduce to it's Minkowski value on $U^i(\tau)$. We discuss implications
of our result for vacuum processes in freely falling frames, particularly in

$\omega$-regular languages. The motivation for introducing them was a desired
correlation between the automaton states and right congruence relations, in a
manner similar to the Myhill-Nerode theorem for regular languages. This
correlation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently
shown that $\omega$-regular languages can be learned from membership and
equivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors.
  In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for
defining omega-regular languages. Specifically, we look into the complexity of
performing Boolean operations, such as complementation and intersection, on
FDFAs, the complexity of solving decision problems, such as emptiness and
language containment, and the succinctness of FDFAs compared to standard
deterministic and nondeterministic $\omega$-automata.
  We show that FDFAs enjoy the benefits of deterministic automata with respect
to Boolean operations and decision problems. Namely, they can all be performed
in nondeterministic logarithmic space. We provide polynomial translations of
deterministic B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi automata to FDFAs and of FDFAs to
nondeterministic B\""uchi automata (NBAs). We show that translation of an NBA to
an FDFA may involve an exponential blowup. Last, we show that FDFAs are more
succinct than deterministic parity automata (DPAs) in the sense that
translating a DPA to an FDFA can always be done with only a polynomial
increase, yet the other direction involves an inevitable exponential blowup in
the worst case.

conclusion is obtained studying at first specific one-dimensional LR examples,
in particular their phase diagrams and contents in symmetries and entanglement.
The purely long-range phases (LRP) are signaled by the violation of the
area-law for the Von Neumann entropy and by corresponding peculiar
distributions for the entanglement spectrum (ES). The origin of the deviations
from the TWC is analyzed from a more general point of view and in any
dimension. In particular, it is found related with a particular type of
divergences occurring in the spectrum, due to the LR couplings. A satisfying
characterization for the LRP can be achieved at least for one-dimensional
systems, as well as the connected definition of a nontrivial topology, provided
a careful evaluation of the LR contributions. Our results lead to reconsider
the definition of correlation length in LR systems. The same analysis also
allows to infer, at least for one-dimensional models, the weakening of the
bulk-boundary correspondence, due to the important correlations between bulk
and edges, and consequently to clarify the nature of the massive edge states
appearing in the topological LR. The emergence of this peculiar edge structure
is signaled by the bulk ES. The stability of the LRP against finite-size
effects, relevant in current experiments, and against local disorder is
discussed, showing that the latter ingredient can even strengthen the effect of
the LR couplings. Finally, we analyze the entanglement content of the
paradigmatic LR Ising spin chain, inferring again important deviations from the
SR regime, and the limitations of bulk-boundary (tensor-network based)
approaches to classify LR spin models.

  Appearance Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video object segmentation is challenging due to the factors like rapidly fast
motion, cluttered backgrounds, arbitrary object appearance variation and shape
deformation. Most existing methods only explore appearance information between
two consecutive frames, which do not make full use of the usefully long-term
nonlocal information that is helpful to make the learned appearance stable, and
hence they tend to fail when the targets suffer from large viewpoint changes
and significant non-rigid deformations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach to mine the long-term sptatio-temporally nonlocal appearance
information for unsupervised video segmentation. The motivation of our
algorithm comes from the spatio-temporal nonlocality of the region appearance
reoccurrence in a video. Specifically, we first generate a set of superpixels
to represent the foreground and background, and then update the appearance of
each superpixel with its long-term sptatio-temporally nonlocal counterparts
generated by the approximate nearest neighbor search method with the efficient
KD-tree algorithm. Then, with the updated appearances, we formulate a
spatio-temporal graphical model comprised of the superpixel label consistency
potentials. Finally, we generate the segmentation by optimizing the graphical
model via iteratively updating the appearance model and estimating the labels.
Extensive evaluations on the SegTrack and Youtube-Objects datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method, which performs favorably against some
state-of-art methods.

an important ingredient in the image analysis is to locate the centers of the

transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which acquires data in a rastering
pattern, pixel by pixel. Due to this rastering combined with the magnification
to atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to
random image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a
series of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the
distortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the
material by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting
highly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust
region approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model
behavior for faster and faster rastering are investigated using variational
techniques. The performance of the method is finally evaluated on both

channel with 1-bit output quantization. On such a channel the information is
carried by the temporal distances of the zero-crossings of the transmit signal.
The set of input signals is constrained by the bandwidth of the channel and an
average power constraint. We derive a lower bound on the capacity by
lower-bounding the mutual information rate for a given set of waveforms with
exponentially distributed zero-crossing distances, where we focus on the
behavior in the mid to high signal-to-noise ratio regime. We find that in case
the input randomness scales appropriately with the available bandwidth, the
mutual information rate grows linearly with the channel bandwidth for constant
signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, for a given bandwidth the lower bound
saturates with the signal-to-noise ratio growing to infinity. The ratio between
the lower bound on the mutual information rate and the capacity of the additive
white Gaussian noise channel without quantization is a constant independent of
the channel bandwidth for an appropriately chosen randomness of the channel
input and a given signal-to-noise ratio. We complement those findings with an
upper bound on the mutual information rate for the specific signaling scheme.
We show that both bounds are close in the mid to high SNR domain.

(at 119 and 79 um) and one or more radiatively-excited (at 65 and 84 um) lines
allows us to model the nuclear gas (<~300 pc) as well as the more extended
components using spherically symmetric radiative transfer models. The highest
molecular outflow velocities are found in buried sources, in which slower but
massive expansion of the nuclear gas is also observed. With the exception of a
few outliers, the outflows have momentum fluxes of (2-5)xL_IR/c and mechanical
luminosities of (0.1-0.3)% of L_IR. The moderate momentum boosts in these
sources (<~3) suggest that the outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the
combined effects of AGN and nuclear starbursts, as a result of radiation
pressure, winds, and supernovae remnants. In some sources (~20%), however,
powerful (10^{10.5-11} Lsun) AGN feedback and (partially) energy-conserving
phases are required, with momentum boosts in the range 3-20. These outflows
appear to be stochastic strong-AGN feedback events that occur throughout the
merging process. In a few sources, the outflow activity in the innermost
regions has subsided in the last ~1 Myr. While OH traces the molecular outflows
at sub-kpc scales, comparison of the masses traced by OH with those previously
inferred from tracers of more extended outflowing gas suggests that most mass
is loaded (with loading factors of Mdot/SFR=1-10) from the central galactic
cores (a few x 100 pc). Outflow depletion timescales are <10^8 yr, shorter than
the gas consumption timescales by factors of 1.1-15, and are anti-correlated

reported using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We shall review some of
the recent key findings that have significantly advanced our understanding of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays and that have called into question the
`classical' interpretation of the flux-suppression above 5x10^{19} eV as being
caused (solely) by the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin effect. Instead, the data
suggest seeing mostly the maximum energy of extragalactic cosmic ray
accelerators. This has a number of implications, ranging from reduced prospects
of doing particle physics with cosmogenic neutrinos to reduced chances of
seeing the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays at all. To address these
emerging and pressing scientific questions, the Pierre Auger Observatory is
presently being upgraded to AugerPrime. It will enable composition measurements
into the flux-suppression region and also improve the particle physics
capabilities. An Engineering Array has been deployed and is taking data. Full
construction will start late 2017.

scalar curvature on a generalized Kahler manifold. From the viewpoint of the
moment map, we obtain the generalized Ricci form which is a representative of
the first Chern class of the anticanonical line bundle. It turns out that
infinitesimal deformations of generalized Kahler structures with constant
generalized scalar curvature are finite dimensional on a compact manifold.
Explicit descriptions of the generalized Ricci form and the generalized scalar
curvature are given on a generalized Kahler manifold of type $(0,0)$. Poisson
structures constructed from a Kahler action of $T^m$ on a Kahler-Einstein

electron-phonon scattering in these materials. We find that the extremely high
lifetimes (3 ps) of low-energy carriers near the Dirac point in graphene, which
are a hundred times larger than that in noble metals, are reduced by an order
of magnitude due to inter-layer coupling in graphite, but enhanced in the

precipitously with increasing carrier energy, and are smaller than those in

provide a physical basis for the ontological indeterminacy needed to derive the
irreversible Second Law against a backdrop of otherwise reversible,
deterministic physical laws. An alternative understanding of the source of this
possible quantum ""collapse"" or non-unitarity is presented herein, in terms of
the Transactional Interpretation (TI). The present model provides a specific
physical justification for Boltzmann's often-criticized assumption of molecular
randomness (Stosszahlansatz), thereby changing its status from an ad hoc
postulate to a theoretically grounded result, without requiring any change to
the basic quantum theory. In addition, it is argued that TI provides an elegant
way of reconciling, via indeterministic collapse, the time-reversible Liouville
evolution with the time-irreversible evolution inherent in so-called ""master
equations"" that specify the changes in occupation of the various possible
states in terms of the transition rates between them. The present model is

oscillates at high frequency in the region allowed by its initial position and
velocity. In quantum mechanics, instead, the ground state of the particle
becomes completely de-localized in the limit $m \to 0$. The harmonic oscillator
thus ceases to be a useful microscopic physical model in the limit $m \to 0$,
but its Feynman path integral has interesting singularities which make it a
prototype of other systems exhibiting a ""quantum runaway"" from the classical
configurations near the minimum of the action. The probability density of the
coherent runaway modes can be obtained as the solution of a Fokker-Planck
equation associated to the condition $S=S_{min}$. This technique can be applied
also to other systems, notably to a dimensional reduction of the
Einstein-Hilbert action.

compressible fluids, with a Hamiltonian as well as a kinetic potential.
  An effective criterion for stability recognizes the tensile strength of
water. This interpretation relates the problem to capillary action and to
metastable configurations (Berthelot's negative pressure experiment of 1850).
We calculate the pressure and density profiles and find that the first
instability of basic Couette flow is localized near the bubble point. This
theoretical prediction has been confirmed by recent experiments.
  The theory is the result of merging the two versions of classical
hydrodynamics, as advocated by Landau for superfluid Helium II, but here
applied to fluids in general, in accord with a widely held opinion concerning
superfluidity.
  In this paper two-flow dynamics is created by merging two actions, not by
choosing between them, nor by combining the two vector fields as in the
Navier-Stokes equation . At rest, as contributions to the mass flow they
cancel, but a non-zero kinetic energy and kinetic potential as well as non-zero
angular momentum remain, manifest as liquid tension, as is well known to exist
by observation of the meniscus and configurations with negative pressure.
(Fronsdal 2020b in preparation).
  This theory gives a very satisfactory characterization of the limit of
stability of the most basic Couette flow. The inclusion of a vector field that
is not a gradient has the additional affect of introducing spin, which explains
a most perplexing experimental discovery: the ability of frozen Helium to
remember its angular momentum.

  Scheduling for 5G Networks","Accepted in GLOBECOM Workshops 2016",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software-defined networking (SDN) is the concept of decoupling the control
and data planes to create a flexible and agile network, assisted by a central
controller. However, the performance of SDN highly depends on the limitations
in the fronthaul which are inadequately discussed in the existing literature.
In this paper, a fronthaul-aware software-defined resource allocation mechanism
is proposed for 5G wireless networks with in-band wireless fronthaul
constraints. Considering the fronthaul capacity, the controller maximizes the
time-averaged network throughput by enforcing a coarse correlated equilibrium
(CCE) and incentivizing base stations (BSs) to locally optimize their decisions
to ensure mobile users' (MUs) quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. By
marrying tools from Lyapunov stochastic optimization and game theory, we
propose a two-timescale approach where the controller gives recommendations,
i.e., sub-carriers with low interference, in a long-timescale whereas BSs
schedule their own MUs and allocate the available resources in every time slot.
Numerical results show considerable throughput enhancements and delay
reductions over a non-SDN network baseline.

with an axially symmetric dilatation (an idealized aneurysm). The processes in
the injured artery are modelled by equations for the motion of the wall of the
artery and by equation for the motion of the fluid (the blood). For the case
when long-wave approximation holds the model equations are reduced to a version
of the perturbed Korteweg-deVries equation. Exact travelling-wave solutions of
this equation are obtained by the modified method of simplest equation where
the differential equation of Abel is used as a simplest equation. A particular
case of the obtained exact solution is discussed from the point of view of
arterial mechanics.
