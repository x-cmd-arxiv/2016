is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the wireless link conditions.
Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission schemes are bandwidth
inefficient due to data duplication at receivers. Network coding (NC) has been
shown to be a promising technique for improving network bandwidth efficiency by
combining multiple lost data packets for retransmission. However, it is
challenging to accurately determine which lost packets should be combined
together due to disrupted feedback channels. This paper proposes an adaptive
data encoding scheme at the transmitter by joining network coding and machine
learning (NCML) for retransmission of lost packets. Our proposed NCML extracts
the important features from historical feedback signals received by the
transmitter to train a classifier. The constructed classifier is then used to
predict states of transmitted data packets at different receivers based on
their corrupted feedback signals for effective data mixing. We have conducted
extensive simulations to collaborate the efficiency of our proposed approach.
The simulation results show that our machine learning algorithm can be trained
efficiently and accurately. The simulation results show that on average the
proposed NCML can correctly classify 90% of the states of transmitted data
packets at different receivers. It achieves significant bandwidth gain compared
with the ARQ and NC based schemes in different transmission terrains, power
levels, and the distances between the transmitter and receivers.

in terms of collinear spin-density-waves (SDW) with the inclusion of many
high-order harmonics, indicating that the real magnetic structure of this

The spectra at low temperatures, T < TN2, consist of a Zeeman pattern with line
broadenings and sizeable spectral asymmetry. It has been shown that the
observed spectral shape is consistent with a transition to the elliptical
cycloidal magnetic structure. An analysis of the experimental spectra was
carried out under the assumption that the electric hyperfine interactions are
modulated when the Fe3+ magnetic moment rotates with respect to the principal
axis of the EFG tensor and emergence of the strong anisotropy of the magnetic
hyperfine field Hhf at the 57Fe nuclei. The large and temperature-independent
anharmonicity parameter, m ~ 0.78, of the cycloidal spin structure obtained
from the experimental spectra results from easy-axis anisotropy in the plane of
rotation of the iron spin. Analysis of different mechanisms of spin and

is to obtain phenomenologically reliable insights for the physics of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from the holography. I briefly review how in the
holographic setup one can describe the QGP formation in heavy ion collisions
and how to get quantitatively the main characteristics of the QGP formation --
the total multiplicity and the thermalization time. To fit the experimental
form of dependence of total multiplicity on energy, obtained at LHC, we have to
deal with a special anisotropic holographic model, related with the
Lifshitz-type background.
  Our conjecture is that this Lifshitz-type background with non-zero chemical
potential can be used to describe future data expected from NICA. In
particular, we present the results of calculations of the holographic
confinement/deconfinement phase transition in the $(\mu,T)$ (chemical
potential, temperature) plane in this anisotropic background and show the
dependence of the transition line on the orientation of the quark pair. This
dependence leads to a non-sharp character of physical confinement/deconfinement
phase in the $(\mu,T)$-plane. We use the bottom-up soft wall approach
incorporating quark confinement deforming factor and vector field providing the
non-zero chemical potential. In this model we also estimate the holographic
photon production.

spectroscopic investigation questioned the presence of O-poor/Na-rich stars
amongst a sample of asymptotic giant branch stars in the cluster M 4, at
variance with the spectroscopic detection of a O-poor/Na-rich component along
both the cluster red giant branch and horizontal branch. This is contrary to
what is expected from the cluster horizontal branch morphology and horizontal
branch stellar evolution models. Here we have investigated this issue by
employing the CUBI= (U-B)-(B-I) index, that previous studies have demonstrated
to be very effective in separating multiple populations along both the red
giant and asymptotic giant branch sequences. We confirm previous results that
the RGB is intrinsically broad in the V-CUBI diagram, with the presence of two
components which nicely correspond to the two populations identified by
high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that AGB stars are distributed over a
wide range of CUBI values, in close analogy with what is observed for the RGB,
demonstrating that the AGB of M4 also hosts multiple stellar populations.

about $2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ and will probe effective new physics mass scales in
the 103-104 TeV range, well beyond the reach of the LHC. This work will examine
the maximum beam power that can be tolerated for beam energies in the 0.5-8 GeV
range. This has implications for how the sensitivity might be further improved
with a second generation experiment using an upgraded proton beam from the
PIP-II project, which will be capable of providing MW beams to Fermilab
experiments later in the next decade.

different quantum interference effects, such as Fabry-P\'erot resonances and

we study how the spin-dependent conductance is affected when a time-dependent

partially or fully removed by the time-dependent gate voltage. The results are
reflected in the corresponding weighted spin polarization which can reach

accounted for by a simple mechanism involving a spatially distributed,

Rho-family small GTPases. This mechanism is supported by a predictive
mathematical model and extensive experimental validation, and can explain
previously reported results for diverse cell types. In melanoma, this mechanism
also accounts for the effects of genetic and environmental perturbations,
including mutations linked to invasive cell spread. The resulting mechanistic

fields and areas, like technological development, industrial processes, social
behavior, fashion or marketing. The number of adopters of a new technology
generally increases following a kind of logistic function. However, empirical
data provide evidences that this behavior may be more complex, as many factors
influence the decision to adopt an innovation. On the one hand, although some
individuals are inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same,
there are others who act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate
from the ""herd"". People who prefer to behave like the others are called
mimetic, whereas individuals who resist adopting new products, the stronger the
greater the number of adopters, are named contrarians. On the other hand, new
adopters may have second thoughts and change their decisions accordingly.
Agents who regret and abandon their decision will be denominated repentant. In
this paper we investigate a simple model for the adoption of an innovation for
a society composed by mimetic and contrarian individuals whose decisions depend
mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance
to adopt it, and the social interactions with other agents. In the process,
agents can repent and turn back to the old technology. We present analytic
calculations and numerical simulations to determine the conditions for the
establishment of the new technology. The inclusion of repentant agents modify
the balance between the global incentive to adopt and the number of contrarians
who prevent full adoption, generating a rich landscape of temporal evolution
that includes cycles of adoption.

features are extremely sensitive to the details of the phase transition and can
behave in a variety of ways significant for late-time cosmology. In particular,
we find that the interplay between the temporal properties of the phase
transition and the mixing it generates are responsible for both enhancements
and suppressions in the late-time abundances, sometimes by many orders of
magnitude. We map out the complete model parameter space and determine where
traditional analytical approximations are valid and where they fail. In the
latter cases we also provide new analytical approximations which successfully

method of McWilliam & Bernstein (2008), focusing on the impact of NLTE modeling
effects and CMD discretization. Johnson-Cousins-Bessel U-B, B-V, V-I, and J-K
colors are produced for 96 synthetic integrated light spectra with two
different discretization prescriptions and three degrees of NLTE treatment.
These color values are used to compare NLTE and LTE derived population ages.
Relative contributions of different spectral types to the integrated light
spectra for different wavebands are measured. Integrated light NLTE spectra are
shown to be more luminous in the UV and optical than LTE spectra, but show
stronger absorption features in the IR. The main features showing discrepancies
between NLTE and LTE integrated light spectra may be attributed to light
metals, primarily Fe I, Ca I, and Ti I, as well as TiO molecular bands. Main
Sequence stars are shown to have negligible NLTE effects at IR wavelengths
compared to more evolved stars. Photometric color values are shown to vary at
the millimagnitude level as a function of CMD discretization. Finer CMD
sampling for the upper main sequence and turnoff, base of the red giant branch,
and the horizontal branch minimizes this variation. Differences in ages derived
from LTE and NLTE IL spectra are found to range from 0.55 to 2.54 Gyr,
comparable to the uncertainty in GC ages derived from color indices with
observational uncertainties of 0.01 magnitudes, the limiting precision of the
Harris catalog (Harris 1996).

define features of the low energy, less than 100 MeV per nuc, cosmic ray
secondary nuclei that have a zero or negligibly small source component. As an
example, the abundance of B between about 7 and 15 MeV per nuc is unexpectedly
large, greater than the prediction of a LBM by 2 or 3 in the measurement and
cross section error. On the other hand, for several other heavier secondary
nuclei with a low source abundance such as F and Z equal 17 to 19 and 21 to 23
nuclei, in the corresponding energy channels between about 10-20 MeV/nuc, zero
nuclei have been observed. The same LBM calculations would predict about 6 to 7
events for the sum of these three groups of nuclei. The B observed intensities
could be more closely matched by considering a nested LBM with 0.3-1.0 g/cm2 of
matter near the cosmic ray sources, essentially a source component of B. This
nested LBM calculation, if extended to the production of the above groups of
secondaries, would however predict a total 8 to 12 events thus leading to an
even larger discrepancy with the zero events that are observed. The
measurements of heavier secondaries at low energies therefore make it very
problematical that a nested LBM with more than a few 0.1 g/cm2 or more of
matter near the sources could be the source of the large B abundance seen by
Voyager. The large abundance of B at the lowest energies is best understood, so
far, as the result of production mostly from a matter traversal of 10 g/cm2 in
the galaxy, possibly in combination with uncertainties in the data and cross
sections at these low energies.

requiring no distributional assumptions on covariate relation to the response.
RF is a robust, nonlinear technique that optimizes predictive accuracy by
fitting an ensemble of trees to stabilize model estimates. Random survival
forests (RSF) (Ishwaran and Kogalur 2007; Ishwaran et al. 2008) are an
extension of Breimans RF techniques allowing efficient nonparametric analysis
of time to event data. The randomForestSRC package (Ishwaran and Kogalur 2014)
is a unified treatment of Breimans random forest for survival, regression and
classification problems.
  Predictive accuracy makes RF an attractive alternative to parametric models,
though complexity and interpretability of the forest hinder wider application
of the method. We introduce the ggRandomForests package, tools for visually
understand random forest models grown in R (R Core Team 2014) with the
randomForestSRC package. The ggRandomForests package is structured to extract
intermediate data objects from randomForestSRC objects and generate figures
using the ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) graphics package.
  This document is structured as a tutorial for building random forest for
survival with the randomForestSRC package and using the ggRandomForests package
for investigating how the forest is constructed. We analyse the Primary Biliary
Cirrhosis of the liver data from a clinical trial at the Mayo Clinic (Fleming

Forest methods for both prediction and information retrieval, specifically in
time to event data settings.

equations have the form of Euler equations with additional source terms
expressed through a fluctuating stress-energy tensor of phonons. Conceptually,
this result is similar to stochastic Einstein equations that arise in the

experimentally measured correlations and fluctuations in heavy ion collisions,
one must confront the reality of changing conditions within the collision
environment, and transport of conserved quantities within the finite duration
of the expansion and dissolution of the reaction. In previous work,
fluctuations of conserved charges from lattice calculations, where charge is
allowed to fluctuate within the designated volume consistent with the grand
canonical ensemble, was linked to correlations in heavy-ion collisions, which
accounted for the finite time with which to transport absolutely conserved
quanatities. In this case details of the correlations were related to the
evolution of the susceptibility. In this work, this paradigm is extended to
compare fluctuations of momentum or energy to transverse energy correlations
that can be measured in heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of these
correlations to the equation of state, viscosity and diffusion is illustrated
by considering simple models without transverse expansion. Only correlations in
relative spatial rapidity are discussed here, but the prospects for extending
these ideas to realistic calculations and for making realistic connections with
experiment are discussed.

in simulations of core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers and black hole
collapse. This EoS is formulated in the context of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) and is generalized to include all DFT EoSs consistent with known nuclear
and astrophysical constraints. This EoS also allows for the possibility of the
formation of material with a net proton excess ($Y_p > 0.5$) and has an
improved treatment of the nuclear statistical equilibrium and the transition to
heavy nuclei as the density approaches nuclear matter density. We include the
effects of pions in the regime above nuclear matter density and incorporate all
of the known mesonic and baryonic states at high temperature.
  We analyze how a 3-body nuclear force term in the DFT at high densities
stiffens the EoS to satisfy the maximum neutron star constraint, however the
density dependence of the symmetry anergy and the formation of pions at high
temperatures allows for a softening of the central core in supernova collapse
calculations leading to a robust explosion. We also add the possibility of a
transition to a QCD chiral-symmetry-restoration and deconfinement phase at
densities above nuclear matter density. This paper details the physics, and
constraints on, this new EoS and presents an illustration of its implementation
in both neutron stars and core-collapse supernova simulations. We present the
first results from core-collapse supernova simulations with this EoS.

enabled a variety of novel applications and phenomena including the generation

optical drive and use instead periodic, pico-second optical pulses. We observe
the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons

pulse locks to the driving pulse enabling direct all-optical control of both
the soliton's repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency without the
need for any actuation on the microresonator. When compared to both
continuous-wave driven microresonators and non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum
generation, this new approach is substantially more efficient and can yield
broadband frequency combs at femto-Joule driving pulse energies and average
laser powers significantly below the parametric threshold power of
continuous-wave driven microresonators. The presented results bridge the fields
of continuous-wave driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear

argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this
structure, one must understand how different individual components of the
overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the
argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a
tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to
argumentation mining, focusing on the two tasks of extracting links between
argument components, and classifying types of argument components. In order to
solve this problem, we propose to use a joint model that is based on a Pointer
Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the
following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument
components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree
structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be
applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original
Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts
to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links
between argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art
results on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving far superior performance
than a regular Pointer Network model. Our results show that optimizing for both
tasks, and adding a fully-connected layer prior to recurrent neural network
input, is crucial for high performance.

discover these aptamers through evolutionary selection of high-affinity
candidates from a highly diverse random pool. This randomness dictates an
unknown population distribution of fitness parameters, encoded by the binding
affinities, toward SELEX targets. Adding to this uncertainty, repeating SELEX
under identical conditions may lead to variable outcomes. These uncertainties
pose a challenge when tuning selection pressures to isolate high-affinity
ligands. Here, we present a novel stochastic hybrid model that describes the
evolutionary selection of aptamers in order to explore the impact of these

their survival is highly dependent on chance. We perform Monte Carlo

winds in the high/soft state. A promising driving mechanism for these outflows
is mass loss driven by the thermal expansion of X-ray heated material in the
outer disk atmosphere. Higginbottom \& Proga recently demonstrated that the
properties of thermally-driven winds depend critically on the shape of the
thermal equilibrium curve, since this determines the thermal stability of the
irradiated material. For a given spectral energy distribution, the thermal
equilibrium curve depends on exact balance between the various heating and
cooling mechanisms at work. Most previous work on thermally-driven disk winds
relied an analytical approximation to these rates. Here, we use the
photoionization code \textsc{cloudy} to generate realistic heating and cooling
rates which we then use in a 2.5D hydrodynamic model computed in ZEUS to
simulate thermal winds in a typical black-hole X-ray binary. We find that these
heating and cooling rates produce a significantly more complex thermal
equilibrium curve, with dramatically different stability properties. The
resulting flow, calculated in the optically thin limit, is qualitatively
different from flows calculated using approximate analytical rates.
Specifically, our thermal disk wind is much denser and slower, with a mass-loss
rate that is a factor of two higher and characteristic velocities that are a
factor of three lower. The low velocity of the flow -- $v_{max} \simeq
200$~km~s$^{-1}$ -- may be difficult to reconcile with observations. However,
the high mass-loss rate -- 15$\times$ the accretion rate -- is promising, since
it has the potential to destabilize the disk. Thermally-driven disk winds may
therefore provide a mechanism for state changes.

both eruptions and implosions, and can easily be extended to non-stationary

presented [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 076402 (2014)] with a near-linear-scaling
complexity, illustrated for a series of silicon nanocrystals reaching systems
of more than 3000 electrons. This advance provides a route for many-body
calculations on very larges systems that were impossible with previous
approaches. While earlier we have shown the gentle scaling of sGW, its accuracy
was not extensively demonstrated. Therefore, we show that this new sGW approach
is very accurate by calculating the ionization energies of a group of
sufficiently small molecules where a comparison to other GW codes is still

treating the gas-phase formation of dust grain nuclei as a chemical process. To
compute the synthesis of fourteen species of grains we integrate a
non-equilibrium network of nucleating and related chemical reactions and follow
the growth of the nuclei into grains via accretion and coagulation. The effects
of the radioactive cobalt, titanium, and sodium on the thermodynamics and
chemistry of the ejecta are taken into account. The grain temperature, which we
allow to differ from the gas temperature, affects the surface-tension-corrected
evaporation rate. We also account for He$^+$, Ne$^+$, Ar$^+$, and O weathering.
We combine our dust synthesis model with a crude prescription for anisotropic
radioactive nickel dredge-up into the core ejecta, the so-called `nickel
bubbles', to compute the total dust mass and molecular-species-specific grain
size distribution. The total mass varies between $0.41\,M_\odot$ and
$0.73\,M_\odot$, depending on the bubble shell density contrast. In the
decreasing order of abundance, the grain species produced are: magnesia,
silicon, forsterite, iron sulfide, carbon, silicon dioxide, alumina, and iron.
The combined grain size distribution is a power law $dN/da\propto a^{-4.39}$.
Early ejecta compaction by expanding radioactive nickel bubbles strongly
enhances dust synthesis. This underscores the need for improved understanding
of hydrodynamic transport and mixing over the entire pre-homologous expansion.

Its gauge coupling to spin current describes the spin transfer effect, where
magnetization structure is driven by an applied spin current. The idea of

function is a sum of local objectives, and each node of the graph only knows
its local objective and inequality constraints. Although there is a vast
literature on distributed optimization, most of them require the graph to be
balanced, which is quite restrictive and not necessary. Very recently, the
unbalanced problem has been resolved only for either time-invariant graphs or
unconstrained optimization. This work addresses the unbalancedness by focusing
on an epigraph form of the constrained optimization. A striking feature is that

dramatically hindered by the absence of inertia. In this work, we show how
propulsive performance in this regime can be significantly enhanced by
employing spatially varying flexibility. As a prototypical example, we consider
the propulsive thrust generated by a filament periodically driven at one end.
The rigid case leads to zero propulsion, as so constrained by Purcell's scallop
theorem, while for uniform filaments there exists a bending stiffness
maximizing the propulsive force at a given frequency; here we demonstrate
explicitly how considerable further improvement (greater than 37% enhancement
compared with the optimal uniform stiffness) can be achieved by simply varying
the stiffness along the filament. The optimal flexibility distribution is
strongly configuration-dependent: while increasing the flexibility towards the
tail-end enhances the propulsion of a clamped filament, for a hinged filament
decreasing the flexibility towards the tail-end is instead favorable. The
results reveal new design principles for maximizing propulsion at low Reynolds
numbers, potentially useful for developing synthetic micro-swimmers requiring
large propulsive force for various biomedical applications.

homogeneous electron fluids at finite temperatures is presented on the basis of

for the paramagnetic state, that for the ferromagnetic state is newly carried
out in which a correction in the strong Coulomb coupling regime is incorporated
into the construction of analytic expression as a function of the coupling
constant and the Fermi degeneracy. The fitting formula for f_{xc} is then
extended over any degree of spin polarization with the aid of available
interpolation scheme. The proposed equation of state, called iSTLS formula,
shows reasonable agreements with the existing quantum Monte Carlo evaluations
at finite temperatures in the paramagnetic state, thus giving a consensus for
the thermodynamic functions between many-body theories and computer
simulations. On the other hand, the current status for the agreement among
various evaluations of f_{xc} is relatively unsatisfactory in the ferromagnetic
state, suggesting the necessity of further investigations.

experiments can be described in terms of a multidimensional effective field
theory (EFT). A new systematic analysis technique is developed using the EFT
approach and Bayesian inference methods to exploit, when possible, the
energy-dependent information of the detected events, experimental efficiencies,
and backgrounds. Highly dimensional likelihoods are calculated over the mass of
the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and multiple EFT coupling
coefficients, which can then be used to set limits on these parameters and
choose models (EFT operators) that best fit the direct detection data.
Expanding the parameter space beyond the standard spin-independent isoscalar
cross section and WIMP mass reduces tensions between previously published
experiments. Combining these experiments to form a single joint likelihood
leads to stronger limits than when each experiment is considered on its own.
Simulations using two nonstandard operators (3 and 8) are used to test the
proposed analysis technique in up to five dimensions and demonstrate the
importance of using multiple likelihood projections when determining
constraints on WIMP mass and EFT coupling coefficients. In particular, this
shows that an explicit momentum dependence in dark matter scattering can be
identified.

rotation frequency $\nu$ and a slowdown model that is specified by its first
two time derivatives $\dot \nu$ and $\ddot \nu$, known as the secular slowdown
model, (2) occasional (once in $\approx 2$ years) significant and abrupt
increases in the magnitude of $\nu$ and $\dot \nu$ (occurring on timescales of
minutes), known as glitches, and (3) much slower increases and decreases in
$\nu$ and $\dot \nu$ (occurring over months and years) that are an order of
magnitude smaller, known as timing noise.
  Aims: This work reports a speed-up event in the Crab Pulsar that occurred
around $2015$ February that is distinct from glitches and timing noise.
  Methods: Monthly $\nu$s and $\dot \nu$s of the Crab Pulsar, obtained at radio
frequencies and published by Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO), are used to
demonstrate the speed-up event. Monthly arrival times of the Crab Pulsar's
pulse, also published by JBO, combined with X-ray data from the RXTE, SWIFT,
and NUSTAR observatories are used to verify the result.
  Results: The speed-up event is caused by a persistent increase in $\dot \nu$,
which results in a monotonic increase in $\nu$. Over the last $\approx 550$
days, $\nu$ has increased monotonically by an amount that is $\approx 10$ times
larger than the timing noise level.
  Conclusions: This is a unique event in the Crab Pulsar. This is probably due
to a small increase in the Crab Pulsar's internal temperature. In its absence,
the next large glitch in the Crab Pulsar is expected to occur around $2019$
March. However, this event could have an important bearing on its occurrence.

Inspite of several experimental verifications of neutrino oscillations and

leaving room for the presence of small non-unitarity effects. Deriving the
bounds on these non-unitarity parameters from existing experimental
constraints, on cLFV decays such as, $ \mu\rightarrow e\gamma $, $
\mu\rightarrow \tau\gamma $, $ \tau\rightarrow e\gamma $, we study their
effects on the generation of baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis and neutrino
oscillation probabilities. We consider a model where see-saw is extended by an
additional singlet $ S $ which is very light, but can give rise to
non-unitarity effects without affecting the form on see-saw formula. We do a
parameter scan of a minimal see-saw model in a type I see-saw framework
satisfying the Planck data on baryon to photon ratio of the Universe, which
lies in the interval, $5.8\times 10^ {-10} < Y _{B} < 6.6 \times 10^ {-10}

that have some unification between $Y_{\nu}$ and $Y_{u}$. Since the $S_{3L}
\times S_{3R}$ flavor symmetry is chiral, the unified gauge group is assumed to
be Pati-Salam type $SU(4)_{c} \times SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R}$. The flavor
symmetry breaking scheme is considered to be $S_{3L} \times S_{3R} \to S_{2L}
\times S_{2R} \to 0$. In this picture, the four-zero texture is desirable for
realistic mass and mixings. This texture is realized by a specific
representation for the second breaking of the $S_{3L} \times S_{3R}$ flavor
symmetry.
  Assuming only renormalizable Yukawa interactions, type-I seesaw mechanism,
and neglecting $CP$ phases for simplicity, the right-handed neutrino mass
matrix $M_{R}$ can be reconstructed from low energy input values. Numerical
analysis shows that the texture of $M_{R}$ basically behaves like the
""waterfall texture"". Since $M_{R}$ tends to be the ""cascade texture"" in the
democratic texture approach, a model with type-I seesaw and up-type Yukawa
unification $Y_{\nu} \simeq Y_{u}$ basically requires fine-tunings between
parameters. Therefore, it seems to be more realistic to consider universal
waterfall textures for both $Y_{f}$ and $M_{R}$, e.g., by the radiative mass
generation or the Froggatt--Nielsen mechanism.
  Moreover, analysis of eigenvalues shows that the lightest mass eigenvalue
$M_{R1}$ is too light to achieve successful thermal leptogenesis. Although the
resonant leptogenesis might be possible, it also requires fine-tunings of
parameters.

in high $T_{c}$ superconductors and has universal features well captured by the
renormalization group method. However recent experiments on magnetization,
conductivity and Nernst effect suggest that fluctuations effects are large in a
wider region both above and below $T_{c}$. In particular some ""pseudogap""
phenomena and strong renormalization of the mean field critical temperature
$T_{mf}$ can be interpreted as strong fluctuations effects that are
nonperturbative (cannot be accounted for by ""gaussian fluctuations""). The
physics in a broader region therefore requires more accurate approach. Self
consistent methods are generally ""non - conserving"" in the sense that the Ward

broken phase where, for example, Goldstone bosons become massive. Covariant

hierarchal generative models. Examples of such generative models include
wavelet scattering networks, functions of compositional structure, and deep
rendering models. Unfortunately so far, for all such models, it is either not
rigorously known that they can be learned efficiently, or it is not known that
""deep algorithms"" are required in order to learn them.
  We propose a simple family of ""generative hierarchal models"" which can be
efficiently learned and where ""deep"" algorithm are necessary for learning. Our
definition of ""deep"" algorithms is based on the empirical observation that deep
nets necessarily use correlations between features. More formally, we show that
in a semi-supervised setting, given access to low-order moments of the labeled
data and all of the unlabeled data, it is information theoretically impossible
to perform classification while at the same time there is an efficient
algorithm, that given all labelled and unlabeled data, perfectly labels all
unlabelled data with high probability.
  For the proof, we use and strengthen the fact that Belief Propagation does
not admit a good approximation in terms of linear functions.

Cloud

one of the popular cloud computing services. IaaS allows customers to increase
their computing resources on the fly without investing in new hardware. IaaS
adapts virtualization to enable on-demand access to a pool of virtual computing
resources. Although there are great benefits to be gained from cloud computing,
cloud computing also enables new categories of threats to be introduced. These
threats are a result of the cloud virtual infrastructure complexity created by
the adoption of the virtualization technology.
  Breaching the security of any component in the cloud virtual infrastructure
significantly impacts on the security of other components and consequently
affects the overall system security. This paper explores the security problem
of the cloud platform virtual infrastructure identifying the existing security
threats and the complexities of this virtual infrastructure. The paper also
discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud virtual

attention and has been validated as a feasible way to address the problem of

Unfortunately, the performance of CPDP is usually poor, and low quality
training data selection has been regarded as a major obstacle to achieving
better prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing
approaches related to this topic are only based on instance similarity.
Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an improved training data
selection method for CPDP that considers both similarity and the number of
defects each training instance has (denoted by defects), which is referred to
as TDSelector, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our
experiments were conducted on 14 projects (including 15 data sets) collected
from two public repositories. The results indicate that, in a specific CPDP
scenario, the TDSelector-based bug predictor performs, on average, better than
those based on the baseline methods, and the AUC (area under ROC curve) values
are increased by up to 10.6 and 4.3%, respectively. Besides, an additional
experiment shows that selecting those instances with more bugs directly as
training data can further improve the performance of the bug predictor trained
by our method.

dynamical systems, which represent a state as a vector of predictions about
future observable events (tests). In PSRs, one of the fundamental problems is
the learning of the PSR model of the underlying system. Recently, spectral
methods have been successfully used to address this issue by treating the
learning problem as the task of computing an singular value decomposition (SVD)
over a submatrix of a special type of matrix called the Hankel matrix. Under
the assumptions that the rows and columns of the submatrix of the Hankel Matrix
are sufficient~(which usually means a very large number of rows and columns,
and almost fails in practice) and the entries of the matrix can be estimated
accurately, it has been proven that the spectral approach for learning PSRs is
statistically consistent and the learned parameters can converge to the true
parameters. However, in practice, due to the limit of the computation ability,
only a finite set of rows or columns can be chosen to be used for the spectral
learning. While different sets of columns usually lead to variant accuracy of
the learned model, in this paper, we propose an approach for selecting the set
of columns, namely basis selection, by adopting a concept of model entropy to
measure the accuracy of the learned model. Experimental results are shown to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

the inverse of the Kasteleyn operator. Its most remarkable feature is that it
is an elliptic generalization of Boutillier and de Tili{\`e}re (2011): it
involves a local function and the massive discrete exponential function
introduced in Boutillier et al. (Invent Math 208(1):109--189, 2017). This shows
in particular that $Z$-invariance, and not criticality, is at the heart of
obtaining local expressions. We then compute asymptotics and deduce an
explicit, local expression for a natural Gibbs measure. We prove a local
formula for the Ising model free energy. We also prove that this free energy is
equal, up to constants, to that of the $Z$-invariant spanning forests of
Boutillier et al. (2017), and deduce that the two models have the same second
order phase transition in $k$. Next, we prove a self-duality relation for this

time-independent theory response of the observable due to a time- and
position-\textit{independent} perturbation $H_{MF}$. We derive the explicit
expression for $H_{MF}$ and show that it originates from the adiabatic
approximation to $\langle k|E_x\hat{x}$ in which transitions between the
different eigenspinor states of a system are forbidden. The expression for
$H_{MF}$ is generalized beyond the real spin degree of freedom to include other
spin-like discrete degrees of freedom (e.g. valley and pseudospin). By direct
comparison between Kubo formula and the time-independent perturbation theory,
as well as the Sundaram-Niu wavepacket formalism, we show that $H_{MF}$
reproduces the effect of the E-field, i.e. $E_x\hat{x}$, up to the first order.
This replacement suggests the emergence of a new spin current term that is not
captured by the standard Kubo formula spin current calculation. We illustrate
this via the exemplary spin current for the heavy hole spin 3/2 Luttinger
system. Finally, we apply the formalism and derive an analogous $H_{MF}$ for
the effects of a weakly position-dependent coupling to the spin-like internal
degrees of freedom. This gives rise to an anomalous velocity as well as spin
accumulation terms in spin$\otimes$pseudospin space in addition to those
contained explicitly in the unperturbed Hamiltonian.

Recent approaches have shown that the identifiability problem could be reduced

shown to be a promising approach for these problems, but sliding windows are
necessary to handle the long sequences which arise in signal processing
problems, which raises issues about how to combine predictions from different
sliding windows. In this paper, we propose sequence-to-point learning, where
the input is a window of the mains and the output is a single point of the
target appliance. We use convolutional neural networks to train the model.
Interestingly, we systematically show that the convolutional neural networks
can inherently learn the signatures of the target appliances, which are
automatically added into the model to reduce the identifiability problem. We
applied the proposed neural network approaches to real-world household energy

well known by the work of P. A. Loeb, R. M. Anderson and others.
  We first review some of the standard facts on non-Archimedean measures and
briefly sketch the prerequisites from nonstandard analysis. Then internal
measures on rings and algebras with values in a nonstandard field ${^*K}$ are
introduced. We explain how an internal measure induces a $K$-valued Loeb
measure. The standard-part map between a Loeb space and the underlying standard
measure space is measurable almost everywhere. We establish liftings from
measurable functions to internal simple functions. Furthermore, we prove that
standard measure spaces can be described as push-downs of hyperfinite internal
measure spaces. This result is an analogue of a well-known Theorem on
hyperfinite representations of Radon spaces. Then standard integrable functions
are related to internal $S$-integrable functions and integrals are represented
by hyperfinite sums. Finally, the results are applied to measures and integrals
on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$. We obtain explicit series
expansions for the $p$-adic zeta function and the $p$-adic Euler-Mascheroni

investigate these data to explore the accretion physics in BH XRBs. We carry
out a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis on all the available pointing
observations, including fitting both X-ray spectra and power density spectra,
measuring the optical and near-ultraviolet flux density. We also search for
correlations among the spectral and timing parameters. The observed properties
of Swift J1842.5-1124 are similar to other BH XRBs in many respects, for
example the hardness-intensity diagram and hardness-rms diagram. The type-C
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were observed as the source started to
transit from the low-hard state to the high-soft state. The frequency of QPOs
correlate with intensity and the hard component index, and anti-correlate with
the hardness and the total fractional rms. These relations are consistent with
the Lense-Thirring precession model. The estimated U-band flux changed with the
X-ray flux, while the flux density at the V band remained 0.26 mJy. These
results imply that the X-ray reprocessing or the tail of thermal emission from
the outer disk contributes a significant fraction of the U-band radiation;
alternatively, the companion star or the jet dominates the flux at longer
wavelengths.

Euclidean distance) often suffer in high dimension, low sample size (HDLSS)
situations, where concentration of pairwise distances has adverse effects on
their performance. In this article, we use a dissimilarity measure based on the
data cloud, called MADD, which takes care of this problem. MADD uses the
distance concentration phenomenon to its advantage, and as a result, clustering
algorithms based on MADD usually perform better for high dimensional data.
Using theoretical and numerical results, we amply demonstrate it in this
article.
  We also address the problem of estimating the number of clusters. This is a
very challenging problem in cluster analysis, and several algorithms have been
proposed for it. We show that many of these existing algorithms have superior
performance in high dimensions when MADD is used instead of the Euclidean
distance. We also construct a new estimator based on penalized Dunn index and
prove its consistency in the HDLSS asymptotic regime, where the sample size
remains fixed and the dimension grows to infinity. Several simulated and real

problem in face of the missing signatures of any new physics in recent

introducing new states observable in current experiments. Appropriate
approximation makes it possible to derive an explicit formula for the final
vevs in the double-scanning scenario extended to the two Higgs doublet models
(2HDM). Analysis of the relaxation in 2HDM indicates, that in a general case it
is impossible to keep vevs of both scalars small, unless fine-tuning is present
or additional symmetries are cast upon the Lagrangian. Within the slightly
constrained variant of 2HDM, where odd powers of the fields' expectation values
are not present (which can be easily enforced by requiring that the doublets
have different gauge transformations or by imposing a global symmetry) it is
shown that the the difference between the vevs of two scalars tends to be
proportional to the cutoff. The analysis of the relaxation in 2HDM indicates,
that in a~general case the relaxation would be stopped by the first doublet
that gains a vev, with the other one remaining vevless with a mass of the order
of the cutoff. This happens to conform with the inert doublet model.

with annotations. When addressing visual perception challenges, such as
localizing certain object classes within an image, the learning of the involved
classifiers turns out to be a practical bottleneck. The reason is that, at
least, we have to frame object examples with bounding boxes in thousands of
images. A priori, the more complex the model is regarding its number of
parameters, the more annotated examples are required. This annotation task is
performed by human oracles, which ends up in inaccuracies and errors in the
annotations (aka ground truth) since the task is inherently very cumbersome and
sometimes ambiguous. As an alternative we have pioneered the use of virtual
worlds for collecting such annotations automatically and with high precision.
However, since the models learned with virtual data must operate in the real
world, we still need to perform domain adaptation (DA). In this chapter we
revisit the DA of a deformable part-based model (DPM) as an exemplifying case
of virtual- to-real-world DA. As a use case, we address the challenge of
vehicle detection for driver assistance, using different publicly available
virtual-world data. While doing so, we investigate questions such as: how does
the domain gap behave due to virtual-vs-real data with respect to dominant
object appearance per domain, as well as the role of photo-realism in the
virtual world.

propagators. We first give an alternative derivation of our previously reported
results for resumming the ladder diagram series of the LWF using a ""matrix log""
technique which accounts for dynamically formed bound and resonant states. Two
types of solutions were found in selfconsistent fits to lattice-QCD data for
the EoS, heavy-quark free energy and quarkonium correlators: a strongly coupled
scenario (SCS) with broad parton spectral functions and strong meson resonances
near the transition temperature vs. a weakly coupled scenario (WCS) with
well-defined parton quasiparticles and weak meson resonances. Here, we discuss
how these solutions can be distinguished by analyzing the pertinent transport
properties. We focus on the specific shear viscosity, $(4\pi )\eta/s$, and the
heavy-quark diffusion coefficient, $(2\pi T) {\cal D}_s$, including its mass
dependence. At low temperatures, in the SCS, they turn out to be a factor of 2
within their conjectured quantum lower bound, while they are a factor of 2-5
larger in the WCS. At higher temperatures, the transport parameters of the two
scenarios approach each other. We propose the ratio $ (4\pi\eta/s)/(2\pi T

counting the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $H$-free subgraph of the
random graph $G(n,p)$. We show that for the case $T=K_m$ and $\chi(H)> m$ the

$m_2(H)=\max_{H'\subset H, |V(H')|'\geq 3}\left\{ \frac{e(H')-1}{v(H')-2}
\right\}$.
  When $m_2(H)> m_2(K_m)$ we prove that with high probability, depending on the
value of $p$, either one can maintain almost all copies of $K_m$, or it is
asymptotically best to take a $\chi(H)-1$ partite subgraph of $G(n,p)$. The
transition between these two behaviors occurs at $p=n^{-1/m_2(H)}$. When
$m_2(H)< m_2(K_m)$ we show that the above cases still exist, however for
$\delta>0$ small at $p=n^{-1/m_2(H)+\delta}$ one can typically still keep most
of the copies of $K_m$ in an $H$-free subgraph of $G(n,p)$. Thus, the
transition between the two behaviors in this case occurs at some $p$
significantly bigger than $n^{-1/m_2(H)}$.
  To show that the second case is not redundant we present a construction which
may be of independent interest. For each $k \geq 4$ we construct a family of
$k$ chromatic graphs $G(k,\epsilon_i)$ where $m_2(G(k,\epsilon_i))$ tends to

(tokens) located at a node among its neighbors, in a round-robin manner.
  We show that in the recurrent state of this dynamics (i.e., disregarding a
polynomially long initialization phase of the system), the number of particles
located on a given edge, averaged over an interval of time, is tightly
concentrated around the average particle density in the system. Formally, for a
system of $k$ particles in a graph of $m$ edges, during any interval of length
$T$, this time-averaged value is $k/m \pm \widetilde{O}(1/T)$, whenever
$\gcd(m,k) = \widetilde{O}(1)$ (and so, e.g., whenever $m$ is a prime number).
To achieve these bounds, we link the behavior of the studied dynamics to
ergodic properties of traversals based on Eulerian circuits on a symmetric
directed graph. These results are proved through sum set methods and are likely
to be of independent interest.
  As a corollary, we also obtain bounds on the \emph{idleness} of the studied
dynamics, i.e., on the longest possible time between two consecutive
appearances of a token on an edge, taken over all edges. Designing trajectories
for $k$ tokens in a way which minimizes idleness is fundamental to the study of
the patrolling problem in networks. Our results immediately imply a bound of
$\widetilde{O}(m/k)$ on the idleness of the studied process, showing that it is
a distributed $\widetilde{O}(1)$-competitive solution to the patrolling task,
for all of the covered cases. Our work also provides some further insights that
may be interesting in load-balancing applications.

moments continue to fluctuate coherently down to the lowest temperatures rather
than develop static long-range magnetic order as found in conventional magnets.
For spin liquid behavior to arise in a material the magnetic Hamiltonian must
be ""frustrated"" where the combination of lattice geometry, interactions and
anisotropies gives rise to competing spin arrangements in the ground state.
Theoretical Hamiltonians which produce spin liquids are spin ice, the Kitaev
honeycomb model and the Heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet. Spin liquid behavior
however in real materials is rare because they can only approximate these
Hamiltonians and often have weak higher order terms that destroy the spin
liquid state. Ca10Cr7O28 is a new quantum spin liquid with magnetic Cr5+ ions
that possess quantum spin number S=1/2. The spins are entirely dynamic in the
ground state and the excitation spectrum is broad and diffuse as is typical of
spinons which are the excitations of a spin liquid. In this paper we determine
the Hamiltonian of Ca10Cr7O28 using inelastic neutron scattering under high
magnetic field to induce a ferromagnetic ground state and spin-wave excitations
that can be fitted to extract the interactions. We further explore the phase
diagram by using inelastic neutron scattering and heat capacity measurements
and establish the boundaries of the spin liquid phase as a function of magnetic
field and temperature. Our results show that Ca10Cr7O28 consists of distorted
kagome bilayers with several isotropic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
interactions where unexpectedly the ferromagnetic interactions are stronger
than the antiferromagnetic ones. This complex Hamiltonian does not correspond
to any known spin liquid model and points to new directions in the search for
quantum spin liquid behavior.

It deals with function reconstruction from a finite set of direct and noisy

used to solve this task and includes powerful estimators such as regularization
networks. Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency
of these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system
identification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine
learning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually
employed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic
systems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the
independent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never
satisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the
connection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting
point is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals
over spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system
identification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear
settings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively
simple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only
BIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels
for system identification. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the
regularized estimator to the optimal predictor under conditions typical of

its effect on the output power is not much relevant. The effect of decoherence
on the current-induced friction depends on the length of the system, reducing
the friction for small systems while increasing it for long ones. Finally, we
find that reflections of the electrons at the boundary of the system induce
additional conservative forces that affect the dynamics of the motor. In
particular, this results in the hysteresis of the system and a voltage
dependent switching.

descent and tatonnement, a fundamental price dynamic.
  Gradient descent is an important class of iterative algorithms for minimizing
convex functions. Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and
synchronous process, although distributed and asynchronous variants have been
studied since the 1980s. Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of
gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on
convex functions $F:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ of the form $F(x) = f(x)
+ \sum_{k=1}^n \Psi_k(x_k)$, where $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a
smooth convex function, and each $\Psi_k:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a
univariate and possibly non-smooth convex function. Such functions occur in
many data analysis and machine learning problems.
  We give new analyses of cyclic coordinate descent, a parallel asynchronous
stochastic coordinate descent, and a rather general worst-case parallel
asynchronous coordinate descent. For all of these, we either obtain sharply
improved bounds, or provide the first analyses. Our analyses all use a common
amortized framework. The application of this framework to the asynchronous
stochastic version requires some new ideas, for it is not obvious how to ensure
a uniform distribution where it is needed in the face of asynchronous actions
that may undo uniformity. We believe that our approach may well be applicable
to the analysis of other iterative asynchronous stochastic processes.
  We extend the framework to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement,
a fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory,
converges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or
Leontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.

Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer
in metal foams under local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The
enthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for
flow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for
phase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the
LTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked
through the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy
equations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several
distinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present
method avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of
the standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead
of the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition
in the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual
situation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with
additional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical
diffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.
Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an
accurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced
solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,
comparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical
applications of the present method.

time. We found that all these processes are connected via gauge
transformations. We have used this result before as a method for resolution of
equations, included the case where the sample space is time dependent in a
previous work \textit{Phys. Rev. E} \textbf{90}, 022125 (2014). We found a
general solution through a dilation of the state space, although the prior
probability distribution of the states defined in this new space takes smaller
values with respect to the one in the initial problem. The gauge (local) group
of dilations modifies the distribution on the dilated space to restore the
original process. In this work we show how Markov process in general could be
linked via gauge (local) transformations and we present some illustrative
examples for this results.

  eyewear computer: The GlaciAR system",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe and evaluate a mixed reality system that aims to
augment users in task guidance applications by combining automated and
unsupervised information collection with minimally invasive video guides. The
result is a self-contained system that we call GlaciAR (Glass-enabled
Contextual Interactions for Augmented Reality), that operates by extracting
contextual interactions from observing users performing actions. GlaciAR is
able to i) automatically determine moments of relevance based on a head motion
attention model, ii) automatically produce video guidance information, iii)
trigger these video guides based on an object detection method, iv) learn
without supervision from observing multiple users and v) operate fully on-board
a current eyewear computer (Google Glass). We describe the components of
GlaciAR together with evaluations on how users are able to use the system to
achieve three tasks. We see this work as a first step toward the development of
systems that aim to scale up the notoriously difficult authoring problem in
guidance systems and where people's natural abilities are enhanced via
minimally invasive visual guidance.

model describing the concentration of nutrients in blood which interferes
directly on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the case of an average fluid
velocity equal to zero. Introducing the fractional derivative in the Caputo
sense, we propose a time-fractional mathematical model which contains, as a
particular case, the model proposed by Sharma et al. Our main purpose is to
obtain an analytic solution of this time-fractional partial differential
equation in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function and Wright function.
