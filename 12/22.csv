output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion,

range of applications. Although considerable research has been devoted to the
development of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to
efficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the
ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd
of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small
monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have
different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of
ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for
comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can
be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the
active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision
process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the
ranking accuracy under a budget constraint. We further develop a
computationally efficient sampling policy based on knowledge gradient as well
as a moment matching technique for posterior approximation. Experimental
evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed policy

triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary
control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by
switching to current source mode, and are replaced by nonjammed current sources
that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy
fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network

In this case, the energy of the system is proportional the sum of all cycle
lengths, and the system can be interpreted as an ensemble of edge-weighted,
mutually self-avoiding loops. The constant of proportionality, $\alpha$, is the
order parameter of the model. Our first result is that in a parameter regime of
edge weights where it is known that a single self-avoiding loop is weakly space
filling, long cycles of spatial random permutations are still exponentially
unlikely. For our second result, we embed a self-avoiding walk into a
background of spatial random permutations, and condition it to cover a
macroscopic distance. For large values of $\alpha$ (where long cycles are very
unlikely) we show that this walk collapses to a straight line in the scaling
limit, and give bounds on the fluctuations that are almost sufficient for
diffusive scaling. For proving our results, we develop the concepts of spatial
strong Markov property and iterative sampling for spatial random permutations,
which may be of independent interest. Among other things, we use them to show
exponential decay of correlations for large values of $\alpha$ in great

forward regions. With this forward jet and two $b$-tagged jets in the central

limits on these invariant masses turns out to be an essential criterion to
enhance the signal--to--background rates, with slightly different sets of
kinematical selections in the two different channels. We consider almost all
reducible and irreducible SM background processes. We find that the non-SM like

connection with the recent work by Dafermos, Holzegel and Rodnianski on
linearized gravity [M. Dafermos, G. Holzegel and I. Rodnianski, The linear

a Fackerell--Ipser Equation, which does admit a straightforward Morawetz

analogous to the strategy appearing in the aforementioned work on linearized
gravity. We achieve inverse polynomial decay estimates by a streamlined version

paper, we present tests of the gravastar hypothesis within flat Friedmann
cosmology. Such tests are complementary to optical and gravitational wave
merger signatures, which have uncertainties dominated by the poorly constrained
gravastar crust. We motivate our analysis directly from the action principle,
and show that a population of gravastars must induce a time-dependent dark
energy (DE). The possibility of such a contribution has been overlooked due to
a subtlety in the de facto definition of the isotropic and homogeneous stress.
Conservation of stress-energy directly relates the time evolution of this DE
contribution to the measured BH comoving mass function and a gravastar
population crust parameter $\eta$. We show that a population of gravastars
formed between redshift $8 \lesssim z \lesssim 20$ readily produces the
present-day DE density over a large range of $\eta$, providing a natural
resolution to the coincidence problem. We compute an effective DE equation of
state $w_\mathrm{eff}(a)$ as a function of present-epoch BH population
observables and $\eta$. Using a BH population model developed from the cosmic
star formation history, we obtain $w_0$ and $w_a$ consistent with Planck

increases linearly with $n$, thus improving over the classical scaling by
$\sqrt{n}$. One of the key challenges in exploiting this effect is processing
the signal so that it can be readily measured; linear processing is
insufficient. Here we show that a Kerr oscillator will not only create the
necessary states, but also perform the required processing, transforming the
quantum phase imprinted by the force signal into a shift in amplitude
measurable with homodyne detection. This allows us to design a relatively
simple quantum electro-mechanical circuit that can demonstrate the core quantum
effect at the heart of this scheme, amplitude-dependent force sensitivity. We
derive analytic expressions for the performance of the circuit, including

Assuming perpetual equilibration, we study a decoupled gas which is
relativistic at decoupling and then is red-shifted until it becomes
non-relativistic. We find expressions for the effective temperature and
effective chemical potential which allow us to calculate the final spectrum for
arbitrary initial conditions. This calculation is enabled by a new expansion of
the Fermi-Dirac integral, which is for our purpose superior to the well-known
Sommerfeld expansion. We also compute the behavior of the phase space density
under expansion and compare it to the case of real temperature and real
chemical potential. Using our results for the degenerate case, we also obtain
the mean relic velocity of the recently proposed non-thermal cosmic neutrino
background.

purely from their input/output statistics, then it seems a plausible hypothesis
that the two procedures must be physically identical. We call such a hypothesis
""noncontextuality"", an instance of Leibniz's principle of the identity of
indiscernibles. Read in the contrapositive, this hypothesis entails that any
physical distinctions between two experimental procedures must necessarily lead
to a difference in their operational statistics. The results I present in this
thesis concern the failure of this hypothesis -- a failure dubbed
""contextuality"" -- when one tries to embed an operational theory (such as
quantum theory) in the ontological models framework. The Kochen-Specker theorem
demonstrates the failure of noncontextuality for deterministic ontological
models of quantum theory, i.e., those ontological models where the
ontic/physical state of the system fixes the outcome of any projective
measurement on the system in a deterministic manner. This thesis goes beyond
the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem by asking what operational facts must be
verified in experiments to conclude that Nature does not admit noncontextual
ontological models, not even indeterministic ones. This leads to
noncontextuality inequalities that are robust to noise in the preparations and
measurements. In the particular case of quantum theory, these inequalities are
meaningful even when unsharp measurements (or POVMs) are allowed, a feature not
shared by the traditional approach to KS-noncontextuality where unsharp
measurements are excluded by fiat: allowing them renders even trivial POVMs
(proportional to identity) maximally KS-contextual. The sense in which trivial
POVMs are indeed ""trivial"" (or ""noncontextual"") is clear in our approach: they
are simply too noisy to lead to violation of our noncontextuality inequalities.

It is well known that for the circular case ($e=0$) and a given $N\in

solutions all of them parabolic and unstable (in the Lyapunov sense) if we
consider the corresponding autonomous equation like a $2\pi$-periodic equation.
Using the method of global continuation of Leray-Schauder, J.Llibre and
R.Ortega (J.Llibre $\&$ R. Ortega, 2008) proved that these families of periodic
solutions can be continued from the known $2N\pi$-periodic solutions in the

for the strong bias in favour of convergent CTCF-mediated chromosome loops
observed experimentally. Importantly, our model does not require any
underlying, and energetically costly, motor activity of cohesin. We also find
that the diffusive motion of multiple slip-links along chromatin may be
rectified by an intriguing ratchet effect that arises if slip-links bind to the
chromatin at a preferred ""loading site"". This emergent collective behaviour is
driven by a 1D osmotic pressure which is set up near the loading point, and
favours the extrusion of loops which are much larger than the ones formed by

change in low-$l$ polarization power. In general the accretion is quite
sensitive to the specific physics involved and the conditions of the early
universe. In this work, we take a minimal approach and find constraints on PBHs

the effect. In addition, we include the relative velocity between dark matter
and baryonic matter including the effects of supersonic streaming at high
redshift which work to significantly reduce the constraining power. We also

They allow us to define the CoS in terms of a relative distance function
between the empirical copula, the Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds and the
independence copula. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that for large sample
sizes, the CoS is approximately normal. This property is utilised to develop a
CoS-based statistical test of independence against various noisy functional
dependencies. It is shown that this test exhibits higher statistical power than
the Total Information Coefficient (TICe), the Distance Correlation (dCor), the
Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), and the Copula Correlation (Ccor) for
monotonic and circular functional dependencies. Furthermore, the
R2-equitability of the CoS is investigated for estimating the strength of a
collection of functional dependencies with additive Gaussian noise. Finally,
the CoS is applied to a real stock market data set from which we infer that a
bivariate analysis is insufficient to unveil multivariate dependencies and to
two gene expression data sets of the Yeast and of the E. Coli, which allow us
to demonstrate the good performance of the CoS.

that --- similarly to the scalar perturbations --- the tensor power spectrum

tensor spectrum is limited to the very long wavelength modes, therefore the
resulting observable CMB B-mode polarization spectrum remains practically the
same as in the standard scenario with flat spatial sections. However, since
both the tensor and scalar power spectra are modified, there are scale
dependent corrections to the tensor-to-scalar ratio that lead to violation of

that accurately incorporates coupling across the locations of users and base
stations, which exists due to the deployment of small cell base stations (SBSs)
at the places of high user density (termed user hotspots in this paper).
Modeling the locations of the geographical centers of user hotspots as a
homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), we assume that the users and SBSs are
clustered around each user hotspot center independently with two different
distributions. The macrocell base station (BS) locations are modeled by an
independent PPP. This model is consistent with the user and SBS configurations
considered by 3GPP. Using this model, we study the performance of a typical
user in terms of coverage probability and throughput for two association
policies: i) Policy 1, under which a typical user is served by the open-access
BS that provides maximum averaged received power, and ii) Policy 2, under which
the typical user is served by the small cell tier if the maximum averaged
received power from the open-access SBSs is greater than a certain power
threshold; and macro tier otherwise. A key intermediate step in our analysis is
the derivation of distance distributions from a typical user to the open-access
and closed-access interfering SBSs. Our analysis demonstrates that as the
number of SBSs reusing the same resource block increases, coverage probability
decreases whereas throughput increases. Therefore, contrary to the usual
assumption of orthogonal channelization, it is reasonable to assign the same
resource block to multiple SBSs in a given cluster as long as the coverage
probability remains acceptable. This approach to HetNet modeling and analysis
significantly generalizes the state-of-the-art approaches that are based on
modeling the locations of BSs and users by independent PPPs.

In
these dense environments, gamma-ray emission should be dominated by cosmic-ray
interactions with the interstellar medium ($p_{\rm cr}p_{\rm ism} \to \pi^{0}
\to \gamma\gamma$). Indeed, starbursts may act as proton ""calorimeters"" where a
substantial fraction of cosmic-ray energy input is emitted in gamma rays. Here
we build a one-zone, ""thick-target"" model implementing calorimetry and placing
a firm upper bound on gamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray interactions. The
model assumes that cosmic rays are accelerated by supernovae (SNe), and all
suffer nuclear interactions rather than escape. Our model has only two free
parameters: the cosmic-ray proton acceleration energy per supernova
$\epsilon_{\rm cr}$, and the proton injection spectral index $s$. We calculate
the pionic gamma-ray emission from 10 MeV to 10 TeV, and derive thick-target
parameters for six galaxies with Fermi, H.E.S.S., and/or VERITAS data. Our
model provides good fits for the M82 and NGC 253, and yields $\epsilon_{\rm
cr}$ and $s$ values suggesting that supernova cosmic-ray acceleration is
similar in starbursts and in our Galaxy. We find that these starbursts are
indeed nearly if not fully proton calorimeters. For NGC 4945 and NGC 1068, the
models are consistent with calorimetry but are less well-constrained due to the
lack of TeV data. However, the Circinus galaxy and the ultraluminous infrared
galaxy Arp 220 exceed our pionic upper-limit, possible explanations are
discussed.

annihilating into dark photons of MeV to GeV mass, is in conflict with
observations. Instead, DM annihilation into heavier dark photons is viable. We
point out that the late decays of multi-GeV dark photons can produce
significant entropy and thus dilute the DM density. This can lower considerably
the dark coupling needed to obtain the DM abundance, and in turn relax the
existing constraints.

comb. Here, a spectra produced by rotating objects, was studied and observed in
a bi-static lock in detection scheme. Internal geometry of a scatterer was
shown to determine the spectra, while the degree of structural asymmetry was
suggested to be identified via signatures in the micro-Doppler comb. In
particular, hybrid magneto-electric particles, showing an ultimate degree of
asymmetry in forward and backward scattering directions were investigated. It
was shown that the comb in the backward direction has signatures at the
fundamental rotation frequency and its odd harmonics, while in the forward
scattered field has the prevailing peak at the doubled frequency and its
multiples. Additional features in the comb were shown to be affected by the
dimensions of the particle and strength of magneto-electric coupling.
Experimental verification was performed with a printed circuit board antenna,
based on a wire and a split ring, while the structure was illuminated with at
2GHz carrier frequency. Detailed analysis of micro-Doppler combs enables remote
detection of asymmetric features of distant objects and could find use in a

nuclear spins due to the hyperfine interaction resulted in the so-called
Overhauser shift of the two-dimensional conduction electron spin resonance. The
maximum shifts achieved in the experiments are several orders of magnitude
smaller than in GaAs-based heterostructures indicating that hyperfine
interaction is weak. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time extracted from
the decay of Overhauser shift over time turned out to depend on the filling
factor of the two-dimensional electron system. This observation indicates that
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is mostly due to the interaction between
electron and nuclear spins. Overhauser shift diminishes resonantly when the
RF-radiation of certain frequencies was applied to the sample. This effect
served as an indirect, yet powerful method for nuclear magnetic resonance
detection: NMR quadrupole splitting of $^{75}$As nuclei was clearly resolved.

views. Second, we propose to use the distance between the current view and its
reference views as the criteria for selecting better reference frames for each
inter view. Third, we propose to use the spatial relative positions between
different views to achieve more accurate motion vector scaling. The whole
scheme is implemented in the reference software of High Efficiency Video

situations and their quantum treatment leads to well-known ambiguities in
choosing boundary conditions for the wave-function at the position of the
potential's singularity. These ambiguities are usually resolved by developing a
self-adjoint extension of the original problem; a non-unique procedure that
leaves undetermined which extension should apply in specific physical systems.
We take the guesswork out of this picture by using techniques of effective
field theory to derive the required boundary conditions at the origin in terms
of the effective point-particle action describing the physics of the source. In
this picture ambiguities in boundary conditions boil down to the allowed
choices for the source action, but casting them in terms of an action provides
a physical criterion for their determination. The resulting extension is
self-adjoint if the source action is real (and involves no new degrees of
freedom), and not otherwise (as can also happen for reasonable systems). We
show how this effective-field picture provides a simple framework for
understanding well-known renormalization effects that arise in these systems,
including how renormalization-group techniques can resum non-perturbative
interactions that often arise, particularly for non-relativistic applications.
In particular we argue why the low-energy effective theory tends to produce a
universal RG flow of this type and describe how this can lead to the phenomenon
of reaction {\em catalysis}, in which physical quantities (like scattering
cross sections) can sometimes be surprisingly large compared to the underlying
scales of the source in question. We comment in passing on the possible
relevance of these observations to the phenomenon of the catalysis of
baryon-number violation by scattering from magnetic monopoles.

black hole (MBH) may undergo many pericenter passages before tidal disruption.
During these passages, the tidal potential of the MBH excites internal
oscillations or waves in the WD, and the dissipation of these oscillations can
significantly influence the physical properties of the WD prior to its
disruption. We calculate the amplitude of the tidally excited gravity
(buoyancy) waves in the WD as a function of the pericenter distance and
eccentricity for realistic WD models, under the assumption that these outgoing
gravity waves are efficiently dissipated in outer layers of the WD by
non-linear effects or radiative damping. We obtain fitting formulae for the
tidal energy and angular momentum transfer rates as well as the tidal heating
rate. We find that these dynamical tides are much weaker than gravitational
radiation in driving the orbital decay of the WD-MBH binary, and they are also
inefficient in changing the WD spin during the orbital evolution. Incorporating
our computed tidal dissipation rate into a MESA-based WD evolution code, we
find that tidal heating can lead to appreciable brightening of the WD and may
induce runaway fusion in the hydrogen envelope well before the WD undergoes
tidal disruption.

images, as well as new coronagraphic H band images from the Very Large
Telescope SPHERE instrument. The disk extends from 1.1"" (65 AU) to 4.6"" (250
AU), and is seen at an inclination of 73degr, which refines previous
measurements at lower angular resolution. We also report no companion detection
larger than 3 M_Jup at projected separations beyond 20 AU from the star
(0.34""). Comparison between the F110W and H-band images is consistent with a
grey color of 49 ceti's dust, indicating grains larger than >2microns. Our
photometric measurements indicate a scattering efficiency / infrared excess
ratio of 0.2-0.4, relatively low compared to other characterized debris disks.
We find that 49 ceti presents morphological and scattering properties very
similar to the gas-rich HD 131835 system. From our constraint on the disk
inclination we find that the atomic gas previously detected in absorption must
extend to the inner disk, and that the latter must be depleted of CO gas.
Building on previous studies, we propose a schematic view of the system
describing the dust and gas structure around 49 ceti and hypothetic scenarios
for the gas nature and origin.

that SLSNe Ic and SNe Ic-bl, including those connected with GRBs, have
comparable widths for their spectral features and average absorption velocities
at all phases. Thus, our findings strengthen the connection between SLSNe Ic

SNe Ic by $\sim7,000$ \kms~on average. SLSNe Ic also have significantly broader

velocities of SLSNe Ic may be hard to explain by the interaction model, and
none of 13 SLSNe Ic with measured absorption velocities spanning over 10 days
has a convincing flat velocity-evolution, which is inconsistent with the
magnetar model in one dimension. Lastly, we compare SN 2011kl, the first SN

(morphologically-selected) population of disk-dominated local Universe spiral
galaxies (z < 0.13) with stellar masses log(M*/Msun) > 9.5. Within this
population, we find that, while a small minority of group satellites are
strongly quenched, the group centrals, and the large majority of satellites
exhibit levels of SFR indistinguishable from ungrouped ""field"" galaxies of the
same M*, albeit with a higher scatter, and for all M*. Modelling these results,
we deduce that disk-dominated satellites continue to be characterized by a
rapid cycling of gas into and out of their ISM at rates similar to those
operating prior to infall, with the on-going fuelling likely sourced from the
group intrahalo medium (IHM) on Mpc scales, rather than from the
circum-galactic medium on 100kpc scales. Consequently, the color-density
relation of the galaxy population as a whole would appear to be primarily due
to a change in the mix of disk- and spheroid-dominated morphologies in the
denser group environment compared to the field, rather than to a reduced
propensity of the IHM in higher mass structures to cool and accrete onto
galaxies. We also suggest that the inferred substantial accretion of IHM gas by
satellite disk-dominated galaxies will lead to a progressive reduction in their
specific angular momentum, thereby representing an efficient secular mechanism
to transform morphology from star-forming disk-dominated types to more passive
spheroid-dominated types.

Here, we seek to determine if the VPOS poses a serious challenge to the Lambda
cold dark matter paradigm on galactic scales. Specifically, we investigate if
the VPOS remains coherent as a function of time. Using the measured Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) proper motions and associated uncertainties, we integrate
the orbits of the classical Milky Way satellites backwards in time and find
that the structure disperses well before a dynamical time. We also examine in
particular Leo I and Leo II using their most recent proper motion data, both of
which have extreme kinematic properties, but these satellites do not appear to
drive the polar fit that is seen at the present day. We have studied the effect
of the uncertainties on the HST proper motions on the coherence of the VPOS as
a function of time. We find that 8 of the 11 classical dwarfs have reliable
proper motions; for these 8, the VPOS also loses significance in less than a
dynamical time, indicating that the VPOS is not a dynamically stable structure.
Obtaining more accurate proper motion measurements of Ursa Minor, Sculptor, and
Carina would bolster these conclusions.

the starburst ring (central 590 pc in radius), while the lower-$J$ CO lines are
distributed over the outer disk ($\sim$ 3.3 kpc in radius). Radiative transfer
and photon dominated region (PDR) modeling reveal that the starburst ring has a
single warmer gas component with more intense far-ultraviolet radiation field

cold ($>$ 70 K and $\sim$ 19 K) component is also an applicable model for the
starburst ring. A possible source for heating the warm gas component is
mechanical heating due to stellar feedback rather than PDR. Furthermore, we
find evidence for non-circular motions along the north-south optical bar in the
lower-$J$ CO images, suggesting a cold gas inflow. We suggest that star
formation in the starburst ring is sustained by the bar-driven cold gas inflow,
and starburst activities radiatively and mechanically power the CO excitation.
The absence of a bright active galactic nucleus can be explained by a scenario
that cold gas accumulating on the starburst ring is exhausted as the fuel for
star formation, or is launched as an outflow before being able to feed to the
nucleus.

extensive saturation values in both cases. In a Floquet spin model, the
saturation value after an initial linear growth is identical to the value of a

mapping the operator EE to a global quench problem evolved with a similar

can probe the strange quark density of the nucleon. These collisions have
center-of-mass energies \agt 10^{4.6} A GeV, where A \geq 14 is the nuclear
baryon number. We hypothesize the formation of a deconfined thermal fireball
which undergoes a sudden hadronization. At production the fireball has a very
high matter density and consists of gluons and two flavors of light quarks
(u,d). Because the fireball is formed in the baryon-rich projectile
fragmentation region, the high baryochemical potential damps the production of
u \bar u and d \bar d pairs, resulting in gluon fragmentation mainly into s
\bar s. The strange quarks then become much more abundant and upon
hadronization the relative density of strange hadrons is significantly enhanced
over that resulting from a hadron gas. Assuming the momentum distribution
functions can be approximated by Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, we
estimate a kaon-to-pion ratio of about 3 and expect a similar (total)
baryon-to-pion ratio. We show that, if this were the case, the excess of
strange hadrons would suppress the fraction of energy which is transferred to
decaying \pi^0's by about 20\%, yielding a \sim 40\% enhancement of the muon
content in atmospheric cascades, in agreement with recent data reported by the

main-sequence star, showed several highly unusual dimming events of variable
depth and duration. Adding to the mystery was the discovery that KIC 8462852
faded by 14% from 1890 to 1989, as well as by another 3% over the 4 year Kepler
mission. Following an initial suggestion by Wright & Sigurdsson, we propose
that the secular dimming behavior is the result of the inspiral of a planetary
body or bodies into KIC 8462852, which took place ~10 to 1e4 years ago
(depending on the planet mass). Gravitational energy released as the body
inspirals into the outer layers of the star caused a temporary and unobserved
brightening, from which the stellar flux is now returning to the quiescent
state. The transient dimming events could then be due to obscuration by
planetary debris from an earlier partial disruption of the same inspiraling
bodies, or due to evaporation and out-gassing from a tidally detached moon
system. Alternatively, the dimming events could arise from a large number of
bodies comet- or planetesimal-mass bodies placed onto high eccentricity orbits
by the same mechanism (e.g. Lidov-Kozai oscillations due to the outer M-dwarf
companion) responsible for driving the more massive planets into KIC 8462852.
The required high occurrence rate of KIC 8462852-like systems which have
undergone recent major planet inspiral event(s) is the greatest challenge to
the model, placing large lower limits on the mass of planetary systems
surrounding F stars and/or requiring an unlikely probability to catch KIC
8462852 in its current state.

shifts due to finite-size source effects in the Coulomb bound energy levels of
a relativistic spinless charged particle. This is the analogue for spinless
electrons of the contribution of the charge-radius of the source to these
levels, and we disagree with standard calculations in several ways. Most
notably we find there are two effective interactions with the same dimension
that contribute to leading order in the nuclear size. One is the standard
charge-radius contribution, while the other is a contact interaction whose
leading contribution to $\delta E$ arises linearly in the small length scale,
$\epsilon$, characterizing the finite-size effects, and is suppressed by
$(Z\alpha)^5$. We argue that standard calculations miss the contributions of
this second operator because they err in their choice of boundary conditions at
the source for the wave-function of the orbiting particle. PPEFT predicts how
this boundary condition depends on the source's charge radius, as well as on
the orbiting particle's mass. Its contribution turns out to be crucial if the
charge radius satisfies $\epsilon \lesssim (Z\alpha)^2 a_B$, with $a_B$ the
Bohr radius, since then relativistic effects become important. We show how the
problem is equivalent to solving the Schr\""odinger equation with competing
Coulomb, inverse-square and delta-function potentials, which we solve
explicitly. A similar enhancement is not predicted for the hyperfine structure,
due to its spin-dependence. We show how the charge-radius effectively runs due
to classical renormalization effects, and why the resulting RG flow is central
to predicting the size of the energy shifts. We discuss how this flow is
relevant to systems having much larger-than-geometric cross sections, and the
possible relevance to catalysis of reactions through scattering with monopoles.

  calculations (2): on the error profile","this article is significantly extended from the previous version",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recent study investigated the propagation of error in a Velocimetry-based
Pressure (V-Pressure) field reconstruction problem by directly analyzing the
properties of the pressure Poisson equation (Pan et al., 2016). In the present
work, we extend these results by quantifying the effect of the error profile in
the data field (shape/structure of the error in space) on the resultant error
in the reconstructed pressure field. We first calculate the mode of the error
in the data that maximizes error in the pressure field, which is the most
dangerous error (called the worst error in the present work). This calculation
of the worst error is equivalent to finding the principle mode of, for example,
an Euler-Bernoulli beam problem in one-dimension and the Kirchhoff-Love plate
in two-dimensions, thus connecting the V-Pressure problem from experimental
fluid mechanics to buckling elastic bodies from elastic mechanics. Taking
advantage of this analogy, we then analyze how the error profile (e.g., spatial
frequency of the error and the location of the most concentrated error) in the
data field coupled with fundamental features of the flow domain (i.e., size,
shape, and dimension of the domain, and the configuration of boundary
conditions) significantly affects the error propagation from data to the
reconstructed pressure. Our analytical results lend to practical applications
in two ways. First, minimization of error propagation can be achieved by
avoiding low-frequency error profiles in data similar to the worst case
scenarios and error concentrated at sensitive locations. Second, small amounts
of the error in the data, if the error profile is similar to the worst error
case, can cause significant error in the reconstructed pressure field; such a
synthetic error can be used to benchmark V-Pressure algorithms.

cooling scales we explore three different energy observables and two distinct
reference values for the flow time. When the aim is to follow scaling towards
the continuum limit, one gains at least a factor of 100 in computational
efficiency by relying on the gradient instead of the deconfinement scale. Using
cooling instead of the gradient flow one gains another factor of at least 34 in
computational efficiency on the gradient flow part without any significant loss
in the accuracy of scale setting. Concerning our observables, the message is to
keep it simple. The Wilson action itself performs as well as or even better
than the other two observables explored. Two distinct fitting forms for scaling
are compared of which one connects to asymptotic scaling. Differences of the
obtained estimates show that systematic errors of length ratios, though only
about 1%, can be considerably larger than statistical errors of the same

distribution of autonomous mobile agents with two control modes: ON and OFF.
The main new characteristic distinguishing this model from standard Markov
decision models is the existence of the ON control mode and its observed
actions. When an agent is in the ON mode, it can measure the instantaneous
outcome of one of the actions corresponding to the ON mode and decides whether
it should take this action or not based on this new observation. If it does not
take this action, it switches to the OFF mode where it transitions to the next
state based on a predetermined set of transitional probabilities, without
making any additional observations. In this decision-making model, each agent
acts autonomously according to an ON/OFF decision policy, and the discrete
probability distribution for the agent's state evolves according to a
discrete-time Markov chain that is a linear function of the stochastic
environment (i.e., transition probabilities) and the ON/OFF decision policy.
The relevant policy synthesis is formulated as a convex optimization problem

Neptunes in orbits of a few days to a few months. There is debate whether in
situ assembly or inward migration is the dominant mechanism of the formation of
such planetary systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates tightly
packed systems with planets whose orbital periods may be expressed as ratios of
small integers (resonances), often in a many-planet series (chain). In the
hundreds of multi-planet systems of sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are
observed near resonances than would generally be expected, but no individual
system has hitherto been identified that must have been formed by migration.
Proximity to resonance enables the detection of planets perturbing each other.
Here we report transit timing variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223
system, model these variations as resonant-angle librations, and compute the
long-term stability of the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223 is
too finely tuned to have been formed by scattering, and our numerical
simulations demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes of the
migration hypothesis. Similar systems could be destabilized by any of several
mechanisms, contributing to the observed orbital-period distribution, where
many planets are not in resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular are
thought to be responsible for establishing the current orbits of the four giant
planets in the Solar System by disrupting a theoretical initial resonant chain
similar to that observed in Kepler-223.

somewhat degraded with respect to that characterizing the standard unitary

to the wide neutrino beam. We also investigate the sensitivity of DUNE to the

important consequences on the evolution of turbulence, leading to the creation
of maximally-helical fields from initially non-helical ones. Therefore, chiral
effects can strongly support turbulent inverse cascade, and lead to a slower
decrease of the magnetic field with time, and also to a faster growth of the
correlation length, when compared to the evolution predicted by the standard
magnetohydrodynamical description. Using the weak anomaly approximation, and
treating the anomaly contributions to magnetic energy and helicity as a small
perturbation, we derive the specific solutions for the inverse cascade regime

  Special Euclidean Group","49 Pages, 20 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization
over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a
set of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated
as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to
solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is
able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the
special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.
The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the
maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as
the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a
certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is
possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of
the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for
solving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,
geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent
optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a
truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.
Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding
procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync
is able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available
measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than
that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and
does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based
approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.

family symmetry, we report a global region in the parameter space where this
approach can account for a realistic spectrum of quark masses and mixing in a 4
x 4 non-unitary V_{CKM}, as well as for the known charged lepton masses and the
squared neutrino mass differences reported from neutrino oscillation
experiments. The $SU(3)_F$ family symmetry is broken spontaneously in two
stages by heavy SM singlet scalars, whose hierarchy of scales yield and
approximate SU(2)_F global symmetry associated to the almost degenerate boson
masses of the order of the lower scale of the SU(3)_F SSB. The gauge symmetry,
the fermion content, and the transformation of the scalar fields, all together,
avoid Yukawa couplings between SM fermions. Therefore, in this scenario
ordinary heavy fermions, top and bottom quarks and tau lepton, become massive
at tree level from Dirac See-saw mechanisms, while light fermions, including
light neutrinos, obtain masses from radiative corrections mediated by the
massive gauge bosons of the SU(3)_F family symmetry. The displayed fit
parameter space region solution for fermion masses and mixing yield the
vector-like fermion masses: M_D \approx 3.2 \,TeV, M_U \approx 6.9 \,TeV, M_E
\approx 21.6 \,TeV, SU(2)_F family gauge boson masses of $\mathcal{O} (2 TeV)$,
and the squared neutrino mass differences: m_2^2-m_1^2 \approx 7.5 x

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw3330",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Jet powers in many radio galaxies with extended radio structures appear to
exceed their associated accretion luminosities. In systems with very low
accretion rates, this is likely due to the very low accretion luminosities
resulting from radiatively inefficient accretion flows. In systems with high
accretion rates, the accretion flows are expected to be radiatively efficient,
and the production of such powerful jets may require an accretion scenario
which involves magnetically arrested discs (MADs). However, numerical
simulations of the MAD scenario indicate that jet production efficiency is
large only for geometrically thick accretion flows and scales roughly with
$(H/R)^2$, where $H$ is the disc height and $R$ is the distance from the BH.
Using samples of FRII radio galaxies and quasars accreting at moderate
accretion rates we show that their jets are much more powerful than predicted
by the MAD scenario. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy,
suggesting that it can be related to approximations adopted in MHD simulations
to treat optically thick accretion flow within the MAD-zone, or may indicate
that accretion disks are geometrically thicker than the standard theory
predicts.

secondary users (SUs) is considered. The SUs have an individual average delay
constraint and an aggregate average interference constraint to the PU. If the
interference channels between the SUs and the PU are statistically different
due to the different physical locations of the SUs, the SUs will experience
different delay performances. This is because SUs located closer to the PU
transmit with lower power levels. A dynamic scheduling-and-power-allocation
policy that uses the dynamic programming, is proposed. The proposed policy can
provide the required average delay guarantees to all SUs irrespective of their
location as well as protect the PU from harmful interference. The policy is
shown to be asymptotically delay optimal in the light traffic regime.
Motivated, by the high complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm in the
optimal policy we exploit the structure of the problem's solution to present an
alternative suboptimal policy. Through simulations we show that in both light
and heavy traffic regimes, the delay performance of the suboptimal policy is
within $0.3\%$ from the optimal policy and both outperforming existing methods.

the bright-exciton FSS, while it is the energy separation between bright and
dark excitons that is often referred to as the FSS in a single NC. Here we show
that, in single perovskite CsPbI3 NCs synthesized from a colloidal approach, a
bright-exciton FSS as large as hundreds of {\mu}eV can be resolved with two
orthogonally- and linearly-polarized PL peaks. This PL doublet could switch to
a single peak when a single CsPbI3 NC is photo-charged to eliminate the
electron-hole exchange interaction. The above findings have prepared an
efficient platform suitable for probing exciton and spin dynamics of

with regards to the tunable finite-sized chain length using iron phthalocyanine
thin films. The deposition temperature varies the diffusion length during thin
film growth by limiting the average crystal size in the range from 40 to 110
nm. Using a method common for single chain magnets, the magnetic relaxation
time for each chain length is determined from temporal remanence data and fit
to a stretched exponential form in the temperature range below 5 K, the onset
for magnetic hysteresis. A temperature-independent master curve is generated by
scaling the remanence by its relaxation time to fit the energy barrier for spin
reversal, and the single spin relaxation time. The energy barrier of 95 K is
found to be independent of the chain length. In contrast, the single spin
relaxation time increases with longer chains from under 1 ps to 800 ps. We show
that thin films provide the nano-architecture to control magnetic relaxation
and a testbed to study finite-size effects in low-dimensional magnetic systems.

submachine. We will thereby demonstrate the existence of a ""paradox"" of
computability a la Skolem: a function is computable when ""seen from the
outside"" the subsystem, but uncomputable when ""seen from within"" the same
subsystem. Finally, we will raise the possibility of defining universal
submachines, and a hierarchy of negative Turing degrees.

optimal design of complex material systems by integrating material science and
design automation. For tractable ICME, it is required that (1) a structural
feature space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the
reconstruction process be property-preserving. The majority of existing
structural presentation schemes rely on the designer's understanding of
specific material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which
could be biased and insufficient for reconstructing physically meaningful
microstructures of complex material systems. In this paper, we develop a
feature learning mechanism based on convolutional deep belief network to
automate a two-way conversion between microstructures and their
lower-dimensional feature representations, and to achieves a 1000-fold
dimension reduction from the microstructure space. The proposed model is
applied to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous material systems with distinct
microstructural features including Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Pb63-Sn37 alloy,
Fontainebleau sandstone, and Spherical colloids, to produce material
reconstructions that are close to the original samples with respect to 2-point
correlation functions and mean critical fracture strength. This capability is
not achieved by existing synthesis methods that rely on the Markovian
assumption of material microstructures.

not been any systematic study to compare these vertex-centric implementations

mainly addressed by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which offers polynomial
dependence on the dimension, query time sublinear in the size of the dataset,
and subquadratic space requirement. For practical applications, linear space is
typically imperative. Most previous work in the linear space regime focuses on
the case that $c$ exceeds $1$ by a constant term. In a recently accepted paper,
optimal bounds have been achieved for any $c>1$ \cite{ALRW17}.
  Towards practicality, we present a new and simple data structure using linear
space and sublinear query time for any $c>1$ including $c\to 1^+$. Given an LSH
family of functions for some metric space, we randomly project points to the
Hamming cube of dimension $\log n$, where $n$ is the number of input points.
The projected space contains strings which serve as keys for buckets containing
the input points. The query algorithm simply projects the query point, then
examines points which are assigned to the same or nearby vertices on the
Hamming cube. We analyze in detail the query time for some standard LSH
families.
  To illustrate our claim of practicality, we offer an open-source
implementation in {\tt C++}, and report on several experiments in dimension up
to 1000 and $n$ up to $10^6$. Our algorithm is one to two orders of magnitude
faster than brute force search. Experiments confirm the sublinear dependence on
$n$ and the linear dependence on the dimension. We have compared against
state-of-the-art LSH-based library {\tt FALCONN}: our search is somewhat
slower, but memory usage and preprocessing time are significantly smaller.

generate unique IQA datasets to test our model, which will be made publicly

understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a
supplementary question for additional input depending on different contexts.
When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update
sentence-level attention to infer an answer. Extensive experiments on QA and

fast electron-positron spine surrounded by a slow-moving or stationary
electron-ion sheath, lepton acceleration proceeds in a highly anisotropic
manner due to electromagnetic fields created at the shear interface. While the
highest-energy leptons still produce a beaming pattern (as seen in the
quasi-stationary frame of the sheath) of order 1/{\Gamma}, where {\Gamma} is
the bulk Lorentz factor of the spine, for lower-energy particles, the beaming
is much less pronounced. This is in stark contrast to the case of pure
electron-ion shear layers, in which anisotropic particle acceleration leads to
significantly narrower beaming patterns than 1/{\Gamma} for the highest-energy
particles. In either case, shear-layer acceleration is expected to produce
strongly angle-dependent lepton (and hence, emanating radiation) spectra, with
a significantly harder spectrum in the forward direction than viewed from
larger off-axis angles, much beyond the regular Doppler boosting effect from a
co-moving isotropic lepton distribution. This may solve the problem of the need
for high (and apparently arbitrarily chosen) minimum Lorentz factors of
radiating electrons, often plaguing current blazar and GRB jet modeling

and vertex algebras has been constructed \cite{BLLPRV15}. This has lead to new
insights in the theory of characters of vertex algebras. In particular it was
observed that in some cases these characters decompose in nice products
\cite{XYY16}, \cite{Y16}.
  The purpose of this note is to explain the latter phenomena. Namely, we point
out that it is immediate by our character formula \cite{KW88}, \cite{KW89} that
in the case of a \textit{boundary level} the characters of admissible
representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras and the corresponding $W$-algebras
decompose in products in terms of the Jacobi form $ \vartheta_{11}(\tau, z)$.

erroneous evaluation of vaccination protocols. We use the
susceptible-infected-recovered model -- the generic model for diseases making
patients immune upon recovery -- as our disease-spreading scenario, and analyze
outbreaks on both empirical and model networks. For different relative costs,
different protocols dominate. For high vaccination costs and low costs of
gathering information, the so-called acquaintance vaccination is the most cost
efficient. For other parameter values, protocols designed for query-efficient
identification of the network's largest degrees are most efficient.

challenge. The challenge is twofold: first, overcoming noise that limits the
precision given a fixed amount of a resource, N, and second, improving the
scaling of precision over the standard quantum limit (SQL), 1/\sqrt{N}, and
ultimately reaching a Heisenberg scaling (HS), 1/N. Here we present and
experimentally implement a new scheme for precision measurements. Our scheme is
based on a probe in a mixed state with a large uncertainty, combined with a
post-selection of an additional pure system, such that the precision of the
estimated coupling strength between the probe and the system is enhanced. We
performed a measurement of a single photon's Kerr non-linearity with an HS,
where an ultra-small Kerr phase of around 6 *10^{-8} rad was observed with an
unprecedented precision of around 3.6* 10^{-10} rad. Moreover, our scheme
utilizes an imaginary weak-value, the Kerr non-linearity results in a shift of
the mean photon number of the probe, and hence, the scheme is robust to noise
originating from the self-phase modulation.

for better representations is the amount of available per-pixel ground truth
data that is required for core scene understanding tasks such as semantic
segmentation, normal prediction, and object edge detection. To address this
problem, a number of works proposed using synthetic data. However, a systematic
study of how such synthetic data is generated is missing. In this work, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset with 400K physically-based rendered
images from 45K realistic 3D indoor scenes. We study the effects of rendering
methods and scene lighting on training for three computer vision tasks: surface
normal prediction, semantic segmentation, and object boundary detection. This
study provides insights into the best practices for training with synthetic
data (more realistic rendering is worth it) and shows that pretraining with our
new synthetic dataset can improve results beyond the current state of the art

cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. We implement coarse-grained representations
of force production by myosin motors and stress dissipation through an
effective cross-link friction and filament turnover. We use this model to
characterize how the sustained production of active stress, and the steady
dissipation of elastic stress, depend individually on motor activity, effective
cross-link friction and filament turnover. Then we combine these results to
gain insights into how microscopic network parameters control steady state flow
produced by asymmetric distributions of motor activity. Our results provide a
framework for understanding how local modulation of microscopic interactions
within contractile networks control macroscopic quantities like active stress
and effective viscosity to control cortical deformation and flow at cellular
scales.

$i=22.8^{\circ}$) made a close approach to Earth in June 2015 at 22 lunar
distances (LD). Its detection during the 1968 approach (16 LD) was the first in
the history of asteroid radar astronomy. A subsequent approach in 1996 (40 LD)
did not yield radar images. We describe analyses of our 2015 radar observations
of Icarus obtained at the Arecibo Observatory and the DSS-14 antenna at
Goldstone. These data show that the asteroid is a moderately flattened spheroid
with an equivalent diameter of 1.44 km with 18% uncertainties, resolving
long-standing questions about the asteroid size. We also solve for Icarus' spin
axis orientation ($\lambda=270^{\circ}\pm10^{\circ},
\beta=-81^{\circ}\pm10^{\circ}$), which is not consistent with the estimates
based on the 1968 lightcurve observations. Icarus has a strongly specular
scattering behavior, among the highest ever measured in asteroid radar
observations, and a radar albedo of $\sim$2\%, among the lowest ever measured
in asteroid radar observations. The low cross-section suggests a high-porosity
surface, presumably related to Icarus' cratering, spin, and thermal histories.
Finally, we present the first use of our orbit determination software for the
generation of observational ephemerides, and we demonstrate its ability to
determine subtle perturbations on NEA orbits by measuring Icarus'
orbit-averaged drift in semi-major axis ($(-4.62\pm0.48) \times 10^{-4}$ au/My,

well known through our earlier works
\cite{StojnicICASSP10knownsupp,StojnicTowBettCompSens13}, the partial $\ell_1$

FOD by an $l_1$-penalized regression under a non-negativity constraint. The

reconstruction of the FODs that is accurate, has low variability and preserves

successfully resolving fiber crossing at small angles and in automatically

requirement for data analytics systems. While almost all the ML tools require
the input data to be presented as a single table, many datasets are
multi-table, which forces data scientists to join those tables first, leading
to data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on ""factorized"" ML mitigate
this issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML through joins. But
their approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Such piecemeal
methods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas to
other ML algorithms. In this paper, we show that it is possible to mitigate
this overhead by leveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the
computations of many ML algorithms: linear algebra. We introduce a new logical

rewrite rules to convert a large set of linear algebra operations over
denormalized data into operations over normalized data. We show how this

measured to be $1.4(7)\times10^{-14} cm^{-2}$, which is very suitable for
buffer gas cooling. Both rotational and vibrational temperatures are
effectively cooled, and large mount of molecules are quenched into the desired
states. Our study provides an important benchmark for further laser cooling of
BaF molecule.

  Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy UGC 5101 with Broadband X-ray Spectroscopy","11 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/835/2/179",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the broadband X-ray spectra of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy
(ULIRG) UGC 5101 in the 0.25-100 keV band observed with Swift/Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT), NuSTAR, Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra. A Compton-thick AGN
obscured with a hydrogen column density of $\approx 1.3\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$
is detected above 10 keV. A spectral fit with a numerical torus model favors a
large half opening angle of the torus, $>41$ degrees, suggesting that the
covering fraction of material heavily obscuring the X-ray source is moderate.
The intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is determined to be $\approx 1.4\times
10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is $\approx$2.5 times larger than the previous
estimate using only data below 10 keV with a simple spectral model. We find
that UGC 5101 shows the ratio between the [O IV] 26 $\mu$m line and 2-10 keV
luminosities similar to those of normal Seyfert galaxies, along with other
ULIRGs observed with NuSTAR, indicating that a significant portion of local
ULIRGs are not really ""X-ray faint"" with respect to the flux of forbidden lines
originating from the narrow line region (NLR). We propose a possible scenario
that (1) the AGN in UGC 5101 is surrounded not only by Compton-thick matter
located close to the equatorial plane but also by Compton-thin ($N_\mathrm{H}
\sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) matter in the torus-hole region and (2) it is
accreting at a high Eddington rate with a steep UV to X-ray spectral energy
distribution. Nevertheless, we argue that AGNs in many ULIRGs do not look
extraordinary (i.e., extremely X-ray faint), as suggested by recent works,
compared with normal Seyferts.

The
first one uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the second one
autoencoders. RBMs are stacked in layers to form deep belief network (DBN); the
final representation layer is attached to the target to complete the deep
neural network. Autoencoders are nested one inside the other to form stacked
autoencoders; once the stcaked autoencoder is learnt the decoder portion is
detached and the target attached to the deepest layer of the encoder to form
the deep neural network. This work proposes a new approach to train deep neural
networks using dictionary learning as the basic building block; the idea is to
use the features from the shallower layer as inputs for training the next
deeper layer. One can use any type of dictionary learning (unsupervised,
supervised, discriminative etc.) as basic units till the pre-final layer. In
the final layer one needs to use the label consistent dictionary learning
formulation for classification. We compare our proposed framework with existing
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on benchmark problems; we are always
within the top 10 results. In actual problems of age and gender classification,
we are better than the best known techniques.

background of a charged black hole spacetime surrounded with quintessence. The
Raychaudhuri equations for three kinematical quantities namely the expansion
scalar, shear and rotation along the geodesic flows in such spacetime are
obtained and solved numerically. We have also analysed both the weak and the
strong energy conditions for the focusing of timelike geodesic congruences. The
effect of the normalisation constant and equation of state parameter on the
evolution of the expansion scalar is discussed, for the congruences with and
without an initial shear and rotation. It is observed that there always exists
a critical value of the initial expansion below which we have focusing with
smaller values of the normalisation constant and equation of state parameter.
As the corresponding values of both of these parameters are increased, no
geodesic focusing is observed. The results obtained are then compared with
those of the Reissener Nordtrom and Schwarzschild black hole spacetimes as well
as their de-Sitter black hole analouges accordingly.

differential and total cross sections at $\sqrt{s}$ =29.1 GeV. Our calculation
of the total cross section is $\sigma =236 \ \mathrm{nb}$, while the
experimentally measured value is $\sigma = 3859 \ \mathrm{nb}$. The discrepancy
between our result and the measured value may indicate that our model
systematically underestimates the values of the relevant coupling constants.

subtleties to which the users must pay attention. Typical questions, which are
often addressed to the data, will be discussed. Such a problem can be the issue
of frequency or band limitation of the signal. Or the source of artifacts might
be of interest, when a Fourier transform is carried out. Another topic is the
issue with fragmented data. Here, the Lomb-Scargle method will be explained
with an illustrative example to deal with this special type of signal.
Furthermore, a challenge encountered very often is the time-dependent spectral
analysis, with which one can evaluate the point in time when a certain
frequency appears in the signal. The information to solve such problems and to
answer this questions is spread over many disciplines ranging from mathematics,
electrical engineering, economic science to astrophysics. The goal of the first
part of this paper is to collect the important information about the common
methods to give the reader a guide on how to use these for application on
one-dimensional data. The second part of this paper will then address the two-

materials in the usage of phase-Change random access memory (PCRAM) which is
considered as the most promising next-generation non-volatile memory. However,
the microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible
phase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change
materials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work
unravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total
energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main
finding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization
process simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom
out of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the
Te vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a
""dumbbell-like"" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of
ab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to
substitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found
to be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved
data retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work.
Moreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the
carrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe. Our results unravel the
microscopic mechanism of the oxygen-doping optimization of phase-change
material GeTe, and the present reported mechanism can be applied to other
oxygen doped ternary chalcogenide phase-change materials.

solve challenging imaging problems. Currently, the predominant Bayesian
computation approach is convex optimisation, which scales very efficiently to
high dimensional image models and delivers accurate point estimation results.
However, in order to perform more complex analyses, for example image
uncertainty quantification or model selection, it is necessary to use more
computationally intensive Bayesian computation techniques such as Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods. This paper presents a new and highly efficient Markov
chain Monte Carlo methodology to perform Bayesian computation for high
dimensional models that are log-concave and non-smooth, a class of models that
is central in imaging sciences. The methodology is based on a regularised
unadjusted Langevin algorithm that exploits tools from convex analysis, namely
Moreau-Yoshida envelopes and proximal operators, to construct Markov chains
with favourable convergence properties. In addition to scaling efficiently to
high dimensions, the method is straightforward to apply to models that are
currently solved by using proximal optimisation algorithms. We provide a
detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed methodology, including asymptotic
and non-asymptotic convergence results with easily verifiable conditions, and
explicit bounds on the convergence rates. The proposed methodology is
demonstrated with four experiments related to image deconvolution and
tomographic reconstruction with total-variation and $\ell_1$ priors, where we
conduct a range of challenging Bayesian analyses related to uncertainty
quantification, hypothesis testing, and model selection in the absence of
ground truth.

Deviations from the conventional behaviour, e.g. the observation of a linear

to exotic electron scattering mechanisms. Recently, linear magnetoresistance
has been observed in many Dirac materials, in which the electron-electron

assigns to every cube a low degree polynomial. The tester randomly selects two
cubes (affine sub-spaces of dimension $3$) that intersect on a point $x\in
\mathbf{F}^m$, and checks that the assignments to the cubes agree with each
other on the point $x$.
  Our main result is a new combinatorial proof for a low degree test that comes
closer to the soundness limit, as it works for all $\epsilon \ge
poly(d)/{\mathbf{F}}^{1/2}$, where $d$ is the degree. This should be compared
to the previously best soundness value of $\epsilon \ge poly(m,
d)/\mathbf{F}^{1/8}$. Our soundness limit improves upon the dependence on the
field size and does not depend on the dimension of the ambient space.
  Our proof is combinatorial and direct: unlike the Raz-Safra proof, it
proceeds in one shot and does not require induction on the dimension of the
ambient space. The ideas in our proof come from works on direct product testing
which are even simpler in the current setting thanks to the low degree.
  Along the way we also prove a somewhat surprising fact about connection

cubes to intersect on points or on lines: for every given table, its success
probability in either test is nearly the same.

  We introduce a simple method to analyze persistent frequency-dependent
correlations (FDCs) between the time series and use these correlations to
hindcast missing historical TSI values. We try to avoid arbitrary choices of
the free parameters of the model by computing them using an optimization
procedure. The method can be regarded as a general tool for pairs of data sets,
where correlating and anticorrelating components can be separated into
non-overlapping regions in frequency domain.
  Our method is based on low-pass and band-pass filtering with a Gaussian
transfer function combined with de-trending and computation of envelope curves.
  We find a major controversy between the historical proxies and
satellite-measured targets: a large variance is detected between the
low-frequency parts of targets, while the low-frequency proxy behavior of
different measurement series is consistent with high precision. We also show
that even though the rotational signal is not strongly manifested in the
targets and proxies, it becomes clearly visible in FDC spectrum.
  The application of the new method to solar data allows us to obtain important
insights into the different TSI modeling procedures and their capabilities for
hindcasting based on the directly observed time intervals.

parameters vary across subgroups. Existing implementations of model-based trees
can only deal with the scenario where all parameters depend on the subgroups.
We propose partially additive linear model trees (PALM trees) as an extension
of (generalised) linear model trees (LM and GLM trees, respectively), in which
the model parameters are specified a priori to be estimated either globally
from all observations or locally from the observations within the subgroups
determined by the tree. Simulations show that the method has high power for
detecting subgroups in the presence of global effects and reliably recovers the
true parameters. Furthermore, treatment-subgroup differences are detected in an
empirical application of the method to data from a mathematics exam: the PALM
tree is able to detect a small subgroup of students that had a disadvantage in
an exam with two versions while adjusting for overall ability effects.

paper, we attempted to estimate this non-uniformity by introducing Shannon
entropy. Shannon entropy evaluates the average information contents of the
distribution function, which reflects statistical homogeneity. We investigated
the relaxation process of shear induced multilamellar system, which is
described with the stretched exponential function. Three types of shear
(constant, square, sine) at different frequencies are attempted in order to
determine their effects on the relaxation process. We found that the Shannon
entropy to which the first moment was introduced is maximized at $\beta~=~1$ :
a single exponential. The Shannon entropy of sine shear experiments exhibited
the frequency dependence. Thus it is interpreted that the increase of the
intensity of shearing and the thermodynamic entropy are reflected on the
Shannon entropy. We discussed the meaning of the maximum Shannon entropy in
terms of various points of view, it was found that it corresponds to the
diffusion process free from the restriction such as geometrical constraints.
The constraints and the non-uniformity of process were successfully estimated
by Shannon entropy. This study gives a new insight of entropy in general.

mechanism, location, and physical impact on the host galaxy remain
controversial. We conducted a multiwavelength six-month campaign to observe the
nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 with several observatories in order to better
understand and quantify the outflow in this AGN. We report on the
time-integrated line-resolved X-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 obtained with the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton. We use the RGS
spectrum to discern the many AGN outflow components. A global fit is applied to
obtain their physical parameters. We find that the AGN wind can be well
described by three narrow velocity components at -650, -950, and -2050 km/s.
The RGS clearly resolves the -20 50 km/s component in C5+ Ly$\alpha$, while the
-650 km/s and -950 km/s velocities are blended. Similar velocities are resolved
in the UV. The H-equivalent column densities of these components are,
respectively, NH = 7x10^20, 2.2x10^21, and 10^20 cm^-2, for a total of 3x10^21
cm^-2. The -650 km/s component shows a broad ionisation distribution. We
identify a photo-ionised emission component blue-shifted by -450 km/s which we
ascribe to the same outflow that produces the absorption lines. The elemental
abundance ratios of C, N, Ne, S, and Fe to O in the outflow tend to be between
1 - 2 times solar. Preliminary estimates of the absorber distance from the AGN
center suggest it is at least a few pc away from the center, but more advanced
methods need to be applied in order to obtain better constraints. The complex
X-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 demonstrates the richness of high energy phenomena
taking place in AGN cores. The subtle spectroscopic differences between the
various components require deep, high-resolution observations, such as the
present RGS spectrum, if one is to resolve them and perform quantitative plasma
diagnostics.

omnipresent in nature and highly relevant for a multitude of applications

Nanomechanical resonators are ideal candidates to study these effects on a
fundamental level and to realize all-mechanical platforms for information
processing and storage. For larger resonator networks, however, this requires
the ability to tune the mode frequencies selectively and to operate the
resonators in the strong coupling regime. Here, we present a proof-of-principle
realization of a resonator network consisting of two high-quality nanostring
resonators, coupled mechanically by a shared support. First, we demonstrate
that we can control the fundamental mode frequencies of both nanostrings
independently by a strong drive tone resonant with one of the higher harmonics
of the network, rendering local control gates redundant. The tuning mechanism
relies on an effective increase of the pre-stress in a highly excited
nanostring, known as geometric nonlinearity. Using this selective frequency
control of the individual nanomechanical resonators, we investigate the
coherent dynamics of the resonator network, which is a classical model system
showing several of the characteristic features of strongly coupled quantum
systems. In particular, we demonstrate mode splitting, classical Rabi
oscillations, as well as adiabatic and diabatic transitions between the coupled
states representing the classical analog of Landau-Zener tunneling. Therefore,
this coupling and tuning concept opens the path to a selective phonon transfer
between two spatially separated mechanical resonators.

relativistic jets. It showed extreme outbursts on June 2015, characterized by a
large amplitude and short time variation of flux in the radio, optical, and
X-ray bands. Not only disk emission, but also synchrotron radiation from the
relativistic jets were suggested by radio observations. However, it is
difficult to measure the accurate spectral shape in the optical/near infrared
band because there are uncertainties of interstellar extinction.
  To estimate the extinction value for V404 Cygni, we performed
photopolarimetric and spectroscopic observations of V404 Cygni and nearby field
stars. Here, we estimate the Galactic extinction using interstellar
polarization based on the observation that the origin of the optical
polarization is the interstellar medium, and investigate the properties of
interstellar polarization around V404~Cygni. We found a good correlation
between the color excess and polarization degree in the field stars. We also
confirmed that the wavelength dependence of the polarization degree in the
highly polarized field stars was similar to that of V404~Cygni. Using the
highly polarized field stars, we estimated the color excess and the extinction,
$E(B-V)=1.2 \pm 0.2$ and $3.0 < A(V) < 3.6$, respectively. A tendency for a
bluer peak of polarization ($\lambda_{\rm max}<5500$ \AA) was commonly seen in
the highly polarized field stars, suggesting that the dust grains toward this
region are generally smaller than the Galactic average. The corrected spectral
energy distribution of V404~Cygni in the near infrared (NIR) and optical bands

(ME) coupling with the low damping of spin waves in BIG can allow the control

strength of this linear ME coupling is directly linked to the presence of
bismuth ions inducing strong spin orbit coupling and to the appearance of local
magnetic inhomogeneities related to the magnetic domain structure. The
unprecedented combination of magnetic, optical and magnetoelectrical properties

applications as well as for theoretical studies.

problems. A procedure that improves the convergence of finite elements for this
type of problems. The a posteriori error estimates relay on a dual problem
formulation and yields an error control based on the, computable, residual of

negative norm estimates. To derive these estimates, the error term is split
into an iteration and an approximation error where the iteration procedure is
assumed to converge. The computational aspects and implementations, which

hashing algorithms are proposed to solve this problem. Every proposed algorithm
claims outperform other state-of-the-art hashing methods. However, the
evaluation of these hashing papers was not thorough enough, and those claims
should be re-examined. The ultimate goal of an ANNS method is returning the
most accurate answers (nearest neighbors) in the shortest time. If implemented
correctly, almost all the hashing methods will have their performance improved
as the code length increases. However, many existing hashing papers only report
the performance with the code length shorter than 128. In this paper, we
carefully revisit the problem of search with a hash index, and analyze the pros
and cons of two popular hash index search procedures. Then we proposed a very
simple but effective two level index structures and make a thorough comparison
of eleven popular hashing algorithms. Surprisingly, the random-projection-based
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is the best performed algorithm, which is in
contradiction to the claims in all the other ten hashing papers. Despite the
extreme simplicity of random-projection-based LSH, our results show that the
capability of this algorithm has been far underestimated. For the sake of

reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures: the first one states that
tractability of the CSP of such a structure is, when the structure is a
model-complete core, equivalent to its polymorphism clone satisfying a certain
non-trivial linear identity modulo outer embeddings. The second conjecture,
challenging the approach via model-complete cores by reflections, states that
tractability is equivalent to the linear identities (without outer embeddings)
satisfied by its polymorphisms clone, together with the natural uniformity on
it, being non-trivial.
  We prove that the identities satisfied in the polymorphism clone of a
structure allow for conclusions about the orbit growth of its automorphism
group, and apply this to show that the two conjectures are equivalent. We
contrast this with a counterexample showing that $\omega$-categoricity alone is
insufficient to imply the equivalence of the two conditions above in a
model-complete core.
  Taking a different approach, we then show how the Ramsey property of a
homogeneous structure can be utilized for obtaining a similar equivalence under
different conditions.
  We then prove that any polymorphism of sufficiently large arity which is
totally symmetric modulo outer embeddings of a finitely bounded structure can
be turned into a non-trivial system of linear identities, and obtain
non-trivial linear identities for all tractable cases of reducts of the
rational order, the random graph, and the random poset.
  Finally, we provide a new and short proof, in the language of monoids, of the
theorem stating that every $\omega$-categorical structure is homomorphically

This paper proposes a class of algorithms that first calculate

physical, observable consequences which then could be empirically verified or
ruled out. As a working hypothesis, we propose simple models of collapse as a
real physical process for direct binary symmetric measurements made on one

the interaction of the quantum system with the measuring device. Due to unknown

a finite time-scale of the collapse and links with experiment. Sensitive probes

compact, Hausdorff (also over any finite set of parameters), that is $T$ is
G-compact. An essentially special case is that if $Aut(M)$ is extremely
amenable, then $Gal_{L}(T)$ is trivial, so, by a theorem of Lascar, the theory
$T$ can be recovered from its category $Mod(T)$ of models. On the side of

search the large space of possible rejection regions, we propose an
optimization algorithm based on constrained optimization and integer linear

maximal power under a specific alternative, maximal exhaustion of the nominal
type I error rate, or the largest possible rejection region controlling the
type I error rate. Applying the closed testing principle, we construct
optimized multiple testing procedures with strong familywise error rate
control. Furthermore, we propose a greedy algorithm for nearly optimal tests,
which is computationally more efficient. We numerically compare the
unconditional power of the optimized procedure with alternative approaches and

this happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which

that saturate this maximum identify a universal family of maximally coherent
mixed states. These states are optimal resources under maximally incoherent
operations, and thus independent of the way coherence is quantified. For all
distance-based coherence quantifiers the maximal coherence can be evaluated
exactly, and is shown to coincide with the corresponding distance-based purity

demonstrating that purity is the most elementary resource for quantum

correlated orbitals (dp-dp model) to the smallest possible two-orbital model

models, the bare interactions are not very sensitive to the compression.
However the partially screened interaction parameters show an almost linear
increment as a function of compression, resulting from the substantial
weakening of screening effects upon compression. This counterintuitive trend is
explained from the specific characteristic changes of the basic electronic
structure of this system. We further calculate the nearest neighbor inter-site
d-d interaction terms which also show substantial enhancement due to
compression. Our results for both the experimental and highly compressed
structures reveal that the frequency dependence of the partially screened
interactions can not be ignored in a realistic modeling of NiO. We also find
that the computed interaction parameters for the antiferromagnetic NiO are
almost identical to their paramagnetic counter parts.

states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are investigated in a
non-perturbative way. We show that the electron dynamics is equivalent to a
problem of massless Dirac fermions propagating with an inhomogeneous velocity,
enhanced by the Rashba profile with respect to the bare Fermi value $v_F$.
Despite the inelastic and time-reversal breaking processes induced by the
electromagnetic field, no backscattering occurs without interaction. The
photoexcited electron densities are explicitly obtained in terms of the
electric field and the Rashba interaction, and are shown to fulfil generalised
chiral anomaly equations. The case of a Gaussian electromagnetic pulse is
analysed in detail. When the photoexcitation occurs far from the Rashba region,
the latter effectively acts as a ""superluminal gate"" boosting the photoexcited
wavepacket outside the light-cone determined by $v_F$. In contrast, for an
electric pulse overlapping the Rashba region the emerging wavepackets are
squeezed in a manner that depends on the overlap area. The electron-electron
interaction effects are also discussed, for both intra-spin and inter-spin
density-density coupling. The results suggest that Rashba interaction, often
considered as an unwanted disorder effect, may be exploited to tailor the shape

paper addresses the former issue by means of an effective method for finding

cardinality-optimal and subset-optimal solutions, and the fact that many
logic-based declarative programming systems provide constructs for finding
cardinality-optimal solutions, for example maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) or
weak constraints in Answer Set Programming (ASP). Clearly each
cardinality-optimal solution is also a subset-optimal one, and if the language
also allows for the addition of particular restricting constructs (both MaxSAT

computation of cardinality-optimal solutions. As a showcase, the computation of
preferred extensions of abstract argumentation frameworks using the proposed

not work in a quantum context, and unwanted interactions with the environment
can destroy coherence and thus the quantum nature of the computation. Because
of the parallel and distributed nature of classical neural networks, they have
long been successfully used to deal with incomplete or damaged data. In this
work, we show that our model of a quantum neural network (QNN) is similarly
robust to noise, and that, in addition, it is robust to decoherence. Moreover,
robustness to noise and decoherence is not only maintained but improved as the
size of the system is increased. Noise and decoherence may even be of advantage
in training, as it helps correct for overfitting. We demonstrate the robustness

(Jones et al 2013, Kohler et al 2015). In this study, we use a single fitting
method applied to all the models to extract a coherent and unique statistical
analysis. We fit the models to the dust emission seen by Spitzer and Herschel
in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC). The observations cover
the infrared (IR) spectrum from a few microns to the sub-millimeter range. For
each fitted pixel, we calculate the full n-D likelihood, based on the method
described in Gordon et al (2014). The free parameters are both environmental
($U$, the interstellar radiation field strength; $\alpha_\mathrm{ISRF}$,
power-law coefficient for a multi-U environment; $\Omega^*$, the starlight
strength) and intrinsic to the model ($Y_\mathrm{i}$: abundances of the grain
species $i$; $\alpha_\mathrm{sCM20}$, coefficient in the small carbon grain
size distribution). Fractional residuals of 5 different sets of parameters show
that fitting THEMIS brings a more accurate reproduction of the observations
than the Compiegne model. However, independent variations of the dust species
show strong model-dependencies. We find that the abundance of silicates can
only be constrained to an upper-limit and the silicate/carbon ratio is
different than that seen in our Galaxy. In the LMC, our fits result in dust
masses slightly lower than those found in literature , by a factor lower than

previous models are not effective or ignore to model this property. In this
work, to effectively leverage class ties, we propose to make joint relation
extraction with a unified model that integrates convolutional neural network
(CNN) with a general pairwise ranking framework, in which three novel ranking
loss functions are introduced. Additionally, an effective method is presented
to relieve the severe class imbalance problem from NR (not relation) for model
training. Experiments on a widely used dataset show that leveraging class ties
will enhance extraction and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to learn
class ties. Our model outperforms the baselines significantly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

formed by dynamically aligning Alfv\'enic turbulence are destroyed by magnetic
reconnection at a scale $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$, larger than the dissipation
scale predicted by models of intermittent, dynamically aligning turbulence. The
reconnection process proceeds in several stages: first, a linear tearing mode
with $N$ magnetic islands grows and saturates, and then the $X$-points between
these islands collapse into secondary current sheets, which then reconnect
until the original structure is destroyed. This effectively imposes an upper
limit on the anisotropy of the structures within the perpendicular plane, which
means that at scale $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$ the turbulent dynamics change: at
scales larger than $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$, the turbulence exhibits
scale-dependent dynamic alignment and a spectral index approximately equal to
$-3/2$, while at scales smaller than $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$, the turbulent
structures undergo a succession of disruptions due to reconnection, limiting
dynamic alignment, steepening the effective spectral index and changing the
final dissipation scale. The scaling of $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$ with the
Lundquist (magnetic Reynolds) number $S_{L_\perp}$ depends on the order of the
statistics being considered, and on the specific model of intermittency; the
transition between the two regimes in the energy spectrum is predicted at
approximately $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D} \sim S_{L_\perp}^{-0.6}$. The spectral
index below $\hat{\lambda}_{\rm D}$ is bounded between $-5/3$ and $-2.3$. The
final dissipation scale is at $\hat{\lambda}_{\eta,\infty}\sim
S_{L_\perp}^{-3/4}$, the same as the Kolmogorov scale arising in theories of
turbulence that do not involve scale-dependent dynamic alignment.

far. Detection of such substructures in combination with detailed modeling can
hint at the presence of perturbing planetary bodies, or reveal other mechanisms
acting to replenish gas and dust reservoirs and forming structures such as
spirals or rings. We obtained multiwavelength images with SPHERE in the near-IR

cube with the IFS. Data were acquired in pupil-tracking mode, thus allowing for
angular differential imaging. The SPHERE standard suite of angular differential
imaging algorithms was applied. ALMA Band 6 observations complement the SPHERE
data. We detect a bright ring of scattered light plus more structures inside,
at least one of them forming a secondary, concentric ring with the first. This
is the first detection of this disk in total-intensity scattered light. A
second object is detected in the field at high contrast but concluded to be a
background star. Forward modeling yields information on the primary parameters
of the disk and confirms that the detected substructures are not due to the
data analysis approach, which sometimes leads to spurious structures. We detect
a series of concentric rings in the disk around HIP73145. This is one of the
rare cases where multiple components are necessary to fit the SED and are also
detected in scattered light. The presence of such ring structures somewhat
questions the nature of the object as a pure debris disk, but the gas and dust
content would presumably offer sufficient explanations for such structures to
form.

We used the bimodal distribution of [Mg/Fe] to chemically classify sample stars
into different Galactic substructures: thin disc, metal-poor and high-alpha
metal rich, high-alpha and low-alpha metal-poor populations. High-alpha and
low-alpha metal-poor populations are fully distinct in Mg, Cu, and Zn. Thin
disc trends of [Ni/Fe] and [Cu/Fe] are very similar and show a small increase
at supersolar metallicities. Thin and thick disc trends of Ni and Cu are very
similar and indistinguishable. Mn looks different from Ni and Cu. [Mn/Fe]
trends of thin and thick discs actually have noticeable differences: the thin
disc is slightly Mn richer than the thick disc. [Zn/Fe] trends look very
similar to those of [alpha/Fe] trends. The dispersion of results in both discs
is low (approx 0.05 dex for [Mg, Mn, and Cu/Fe]) and is even much lower for
[Ni/Fe] (approx 0.035 dex). Zn is an alpha-like element and could be used to
separate thin and thick disc stars. [Mn/Mg] ratio could also be a very good
tool for tagging Galactic substructures. Some models can partially reproduce
the observed Mg, Zn, and, Cu behaviours. Models mostly fail to reproduce Mn and
Ni in all metallicity domains, however, models adopting yields normalised from
solar chemical properties reproduce Mn and Ni better, suggesting that there is
still a lack of realistic theoretical yields of some iron-peak elements. Very

the local Curvature-Dimension condition $\mathsf{CD}_{loc}(K,N)$ with
parameters $K \in \mathbb{R}$ and $N \in (1,\infty)$, also verifies the global
Curvature-Dimension condition $\mathsf{CD}(K,N)$. In other words, the
Curvature-Dimension condition enjoys the globalization (or local-to-global)
property, answering a question which had remained open since the beginning of
the theory.
  For the proof, we establish an equivalence between $L^1$ and $L^2$
optimal-transport-based interpolation. The challenge is not merely a technical
one, and several new conceptual ingredients which are of independent interest
are developed: an explicit change-of-variables formula for densities of
Wasserstein geodesics depending on a second-order temporal derivative of
associated Kantorovich potentials; a surprising third-order theory for the
latter Kantorovich potentials, which holds in complete generality on any proper
geodesic space; and a certain rigidity property of the change-of-variables
formula, allowing us to bootstrap the a-priori available regularity. As a
consequence, numerous variants of the Curvature-Dimension condition proposed by
various authors throughout the years are shown to, in fact, all be equivalent
in the above setting, thereby unifying the theory.

out of the zetabytes of sensor data collected every day. For some applications,
the goal is to analyze and understand the data to identify trends (e.g.,
surveillance, portable/wearable electronics); in other applications, the goal
is to take immediate action based the data (e.g., robotics/drones, self-driving
cars, smart Internet of Things). For many of these applications, local embedded
processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or
latency concerns, or limitations in the communication bandwidth. However, at
the sensor there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost
in addition to throughput and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, flexibility
is often required such that the processing can be adapted for different
applications or environments (e.g., update the weights and model in the
classifier). In many applications, machine learning often involves transforming
the input data into a higher dimensional space, which, along with programmable
weights, increases data movement and consequently energy consumption. In this
paper, we will discuss how these challenges can be addressed at various levels
of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms,
mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies (including memories and

However, the largest single-chip SiPM is still less than 1~cm$^2$. In order to

to use multiple SiPMs. In this work, scintillation detectors are constructed
and tested with a custom 2x2 SiPM array. The layout of the SiPMs and the
geometry of the scintillator were determined by performing Geant4 simulations.
Cubic NaI, CsI, and CLYC with 18~mm sides have been tested. The output of the
scintillation detectors are stabilized over the temperature range between --20

Furthermore, neutron detection for the CLYC detector was studied in the same

fluctuate. Consequently, electronic states are expected to be spatially
localized. We consider the regime of strong localization, namely, the
localization length is smaller than the length of the molecular wire.
Electron-vibron interaction, taking place in each single molecule, is also
taken into account. We investigate the interplay between disorder and
electron-vibron interaction in response to either an applied electric bias or a
temperature gradient. To this end, we calculate the electric and heat currents
when the nanowire is connected to leads, using the Keldysh non-equilibrium

dominates both charge and heat transport. We find that the electron-vibron

between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. A given quantum state is considered
to be steerable if it violates a suitably chosen steering inequality. A quantum
state which otherwise satisfies a certain inequality can violate the inequality
under a global change of basis i.e, if the state is transformed by a nonlocal
unitary operation. Intriguingly there are states which preserve their
non-violation(pertaining to the said inequality) under any global unitary
operation. The present work explores the effect of global unitary operations on
the steering ability of a quantum state which live in two qubits. We
characterize such states in terms of a necessary and sufficient condition on
their spectrum. Such states are also characterized in terms of some analytic
characteristics of the set to which they belong. Looking back at steerability
the present work also provides a relation between steerability and quantum
teleportation together with the derivation of a result related to the optimal
violation of steering inequality . An analytic estimation of the size of such
non-violating states in terms of purity is also obtained. Interestingly the
estimation in terms of purity also gives a necessary and sufficient condition

aerodynamics of flapping wing flight. The issues inherent to animal
experiments, such as poor controllability and unnatural flapping when tethered,
can be avoided by using robotic flyers. Such an approach holds a promise for a
more systematic and repeatable methodology for flow visualisation, through a
better controlled flight. Such experiments require high precision position
control, however, and until now this was not possible due to the challenging
flight dynamics and payload restrictions of flapping wing Micro Air Vehicles
(FWMAV). Here, we present a new FWMAV-specific control approach that, by
employing an external motion tracking system, achieved autonomous wind tunnel
flight with a maximum root-mean-square position error of 28 mm at low speeds
(0.8 - 1.2 m/s) and 75 mm at high speeds (2 - 2.4 m/s). This allowed the first
free-flight flow visualisation experiments to be conducted with an FWMAV.
Time-resolved stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to
reconstruct the 3D flow patterns of the FWMAV wake. A good qualitative match
was found in comparison to a tethered configuration at similar conditions,
suggesting that the obtained free-flight measurements are reliable and
meaningful.

through porous materials a rush of the experimental moisture front is commonly
observed in several works shown in the literature, with transient models that
consider only the diffusion process. Thus, to overcome the discrepancies
between the experimental and the numerical models, this paper proposes to
include the moisture advection transfer in the governing equation. To solve the
advection-diffusion differential equation, it is first proposed two efficient
numerical schemes and their efficiencies are investigated for both linear and
nonlinear cases. The first scheme, Scharfetter-Gummel (SG), presents a
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition but is more accurate and faster than
the second scheme, the well-known Crank-Nicolson approach. Furthermore, the SG
scheme has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserved.
Then, to conclude, results of the convective moisture transfer problem obtained
with the SG numerical scheme are compared to experimental data from the
literature. The inclusion of an advective term in the model may clearly lead to
better results than purely diffusive models.

polarization direction between the emission at the source and the detection at
the observer, are non-negligible in the determination of the polarization
spectra. They have to be taken into account for an accurate estimation of
cosmological parameters sensitive to or even based on these spectra. We study
in detail the impact of higher order lensing on the determination of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and on the estimation of the effective number of
relativistic species $N_\text{eff}$. We find that neglecting higher order
lensing terms can lead to misinterpreting these corrections as a primordial
tensor-to-scalar ratio of about $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. Furthermore, it leads
to a shift of the parameter $N_\text{eff}$ by nearly two sigma considering the

high resolution multispectral sensor (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) imagery on
water mapping. Difficulties of water mapping on high resolution data includes:
1) misclassification between water and shadows or other low-reflectance ground
objects, which is mostly caused by the spectral similarity within the given
band range; 2) small water bodies with size smaller than the spatial resolution
of MS image. To solve the confusion between water and low-reflectance objects,
the Landsat 8 time series with two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands is added
because water has extremely strong absorption in SWIR. In order to integrate
the three multi-sensor, multi-resolution data sets, the probabilistic graphical
model (PGM) is utilized here with conditional probability distribution defined
mainly based on the size of each object. For comparison, results from the SVM
classifier on the PCA fused and MS data, thresholding method on the PAN image,
and water index method on the Landsat data are computed. The confusion matrices
are calculated for all the methods. The results demonstrate that the PGM method
can achieve the best performance with the highest overall accuracy. Moreover,
small rivers can also be extracted by adding weight on the PAN result in PGM.
Finally, the post-classification procedure is applied on the PGM result to
further exclude misclassification in shadow and water-land boundary regions.
Accordingly, the producer's, user's and overall accuracy are all increased,
indicating the effectiveness of our method.

Collatz conjecture, also known as the (3x + 1) or Syracuse conjecture. The
analysis is structured as follows. First, three distinct fixed points are found
for the third iterate of the Collatz map, which hence organise in a period 3
orbit of the original map. These are 1, 2 and 4, the elements which define the
unique attracting cycle, as hypothesised by Collatz. To carry out the
calculation we write the positive integers in modulo 8 (mod8 ), obtain a closed
analytical form for the associated map and determine the transitions that yield
contracting or expanding iterates in the original, infinite-dimensional, space
of positive integers. Then, we consider a Markov chain which runs on the
reduced space of mod8 congruence classes of integers. The transition
probabilities of the Markov chain are computed from the deterministic map, by
employing a measure that is invariant for the map itself. Working in this
setting, we demonstrate that the stationary distribution sampled by the
stochastic system induces a contracting behaviour for the orbits of the
deterministic map on the original space of the positive integers. Sampling the
equilibrium distribution on the congruence classes mod8^m for any m, which
amounts to arbitrarily reducing the degree of imposed coarse graining, returns
an identical conclusion.

matched by a bimodal-Gaussian form where the metal-rich and metal-poor modes
are separated by ~0.8 dex, but the internal dispersions of each mode are so
large that the total MDF becomes very broad and nearly continuous from [Fe/H] =
-2.4 to Solar. There are, however, significant differences between galaxies in
the relative numbers of \emph{metal-rich} clusters, suggesting that they
underwent significantly different histories of mergers with massive, gas-rich
halos. Lastly, the proportion of metal-poor GCs rises especially rapidly
outside projected radii R > 4 R_eff, suggesting the importance of accreted
dwarf satellites in the outer halo. Comprehensive models for the formation of
GCs as part of the hierarchical formation of their parent galaxies will be
needed to trace the systematic change in structure of the MDF with galaxy mass,
from the distinctly bimodal form in smaller galaxies up to the broad continuum

mention that an interacting Chaplygin gas model was considered in 2006 by Zhang

the energy densities of Chaplygin gas and dust. Our model can successfully
explain the transition from the early decelerating phase to the present phase

interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them,

technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the
interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device
communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is
mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined
IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have
proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and
compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea
of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it,
and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In
addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the
user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a
smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The
proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has
the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any
hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere.
A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT
network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing

indiscriminately. This makes the grid vulnerable to demand fluctuations and
much effort has been invested to mitigate their effect. The Digital Power
Network (DPN) is an energy-on-demand approach to power grids. In the new
(digital) approach, the user initiates an energy request. This action
alleviates uncertainties in energy demands. The service provider may grant the
request fully or partially. Energy is then transmitted in discrete units,
analogous to packets of data over a computer network. The packetized energy is
routed to the user address. Because energy demands are known ahead of time, the
energy provider may optimize the power distribution of the entire power network
and isolate pockets of instabilities. For example, under severe energy
constraints the energy provider may queue some energy requests and grant these
requests later. Alternative energy resources may be seamlessly incorporated
into the power network as yet another address in the system and since their
energy is coded, they would be connected to specific users directly. In its
simplest form, this grid can be realized by overlaying an auxiliary
(communication) network on top of an energy delivery network (the current
transmission lines) and coupling the two through an array of addressable
digital power switches. Optimization of energy requests is the topic of this
paper. We investigate the role of the network queue and provide a snapshot of

path for energy flow in a standard IEEE 39 bus are considered, as well.
