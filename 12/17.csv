interesting open questions. In this note, we commence a study of those unimodal
Gorenstein $h$-vectors that do \emph{not} satisfy the Stanley-Iarrobino

$h$-vectors exist: 1) In socle degree $e$ if and only if $e\ge 6$; and 2) In
every codimension five or greater. The main case that remains open is that of
codimension four, where no Gorenstein $h$-vector is known without the
Stanley-Iarrobino property. We conclude by proposing the following very general
conjecture: The existence of any arbitrary level $h$-vector is
\emph{independent} of the characteristic of the base field.

crucial achievement in most industrialized countries.
  The higher variability of power production via renewables leads to a rise in
ancillary service costs over the power system, in particular costs within the
electricity balancing markets, mainly due to an increased number of extreme
price spikes. This study focuses on forecasting the behavior of price and
volumes of the Italian balancing market in the presence of an increased share
of renewable energy sources. Starting from configurations of load and power
production, which guarantee a stable performance, we implement fluctuations in
the load and in renewables; in particular we artificially increase the
contribution of renewables as compared to conventional power sources to cover
the total load. We then forecast the amount of provided energy in the balancing
market and its fluctuations, which are induced by production and consumption.
Within an approach of agent based modeling we estimate the resulting energy
prices and costs. While their average values turn out to be only slightly
affected by an increased contribution from renewables, the probability for
extreme price events is shown to increase along with undesired peaks in the
costs.

The overlay nodes are capable of implementing any dynamic routing policy,

simple work-conserving forwarding policy. Moreover, the underlay routes are
pre-determined and unknown to the overlay network. The overlay network can
increase the achievable throughput of the underlay by using multiple routes,

letter forwarding experiments from the 60s, was theoretically explained by
Kleinberg in 2000. However, from today's perspective his model has several
severe shortcomings that limit the applicability to real-world networks. In
order to give a more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world
phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible random
graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) which overcomes all
previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has
also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably
captures real-world networks.
  In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed as each
vertex only needs to know information about its direct neighbors. We prove that
it succeeds with constant probability, and in case of success almost surely
finds an almost shortest path of length {\theta}(loglog n), where our bound is
tight including the leading constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching
methods which augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require
any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure success probability
1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps.
  These results also address the question of Krioukov et al. whether there are
efficient local routing protocols for the internet graph. There were promising
experimental studies, but the question remained unsolved theoretically. Our
results give for the first time a rigorous and analytical affirmative answer.

predicted to be a two-mode squeezed vacuum. However, the corresponding quantum
correlations are currently unobservable in condensed matter where such a
coupling can be reached, since it cannot be extracted from these systems. Here,
we show that superconducting circuits can be used to perform an analog
simulation of a system of two bosonic modes in regimes ranging from strong to
ultrastrong coupling. More importantly, our quantum simulation setup enables us
to detect output excitations that are related to the ground-state properties of
the bosonic modes. We compute the emission spectra of this physical system and
show that the produced state presents single- and two-mode squeezing
simultaneously.

reap benefits of parallelization, albeit subject to a synchronization
constraint at the output. Fork-Join (FJ) queuing models are used to analyze
such systems. Arriving jobs are split into tasks each of which is mapped to
exactly one server. A job leaves the system when all of its tasks are executed.
  As a metric of performance, we consider waiting times for both
work-conserving and non-work conserving server systems under a mathematical
set-up general enough to take into account possible phase-type behavior of the
servers, and as suggested by recent evidences, bursty arrivals.
  To this end, we present a Markov-additive process framework for an FJ system
and provide computable bounds on tail probabilities of steady-state waiting
times, for both types of servers separately. We apply our results to three
scenarios, namely, non-renewal (Markov-modulated) arrivals, servers showing
phase-type behavior, and Markov-modulated arrivals and services. We compare our
bounds against estimates obtained through simulations and also provide a
theoretical conceptualization of provisions in FJ systems. Finally, we
calibrate our model with real data traces, and illustrate how our bounds can be
used to devise provisions.

dynamical system subject to nonstochastic disturbances. The estimator obtains
all its information through an uncertain channel which is subject to
nonstochastic disturbances as well, and an eavesdropper obtains a disturbed
version of the channel inputs through a second uncertain channel. An encoder
observes and block-encodes the states in such a way that, upon sending the
generated codeword, the estimator's error is bounded and such that a security
criterion is satisfied ensuring that the eavesdropper obtains as little state

with the help of a numerical example. A sufficient condition on the uncertain
wiretap channel, i.e., the pair formed by the uncertain channel from encoder to
estimator and the uncertain channel from encoder to eavesdropper, is derived
which ensures that a bounded estimation error and security are achieved. This
condition is also shown to be necessary for a subclass of uncertain wiretap
channels. To formulate the condition, the zero-error secrecy capacity of
uncertain wiretap channels is introduced, i.e., the maximal rate at which data
can be transmitted from the encoder to the estimator in such a way that the
eavesdropper is unable to reconstruct the transmitted data. Lastly, the
zero-error secrecy capacity of uncertain wiretap channels is studied.

velocity and the density-inferred potential profile is small (<5%). Finally,
while the sub-halos show 15% biases in their representation of the particle

programming languages for systems development without experiencing a negative
impact on performance. A database system designed according to this vision
offers both increased productivity and high performance, instead of sacrificing
the former for the latter as is the case with existing, monolithic
implementations that are hard to maintain and extend. In this article, we
realize this vision in the domain of analytical query processing. We present
LegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level language Scala. The key
technique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: LegoBase
performs source-to-source compilation and optimizes the entire query engine by
converting the high-level Scala code to specialized, low-level C code. We show
how generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of
optimizations, such as introducing data partitioning or switching from a row to
a column data layout, which are difficult to achieve with existing low-level
query compilers that handle only queries. We demonstrate that sufficiently
powerful abstractions are essential for dealing with the complexity of the
optimization effort, shielding developers from compiler internals and
decoupling individual optimizations from each other. We evaluate our approach
with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) With all optimizations enabled,
LegoBase significantly outperforms a commercial database and an existing query
compiler. (b) Programmers need to provide just a few hundred lines of
high-level code for implementing the optimizations, instead of complicated
low-level code that is required by existing query compilation approaches. (c)
The compilation overhead is low compared to the overall execution time, thus
making our approach usable in practice for compiling query engines.

of banded block quasi-Toeplitz matrices that we call corner-modified. Corner
modifications of otherwise arbitrary banded block-Toeplitz matrices capture the
effect of boundary conditions and the associated breakdown of translational
invariance. Our algorithm leverages the interplay between a non-standard,
projector-based method of kernel determination (physically, a bulk-boundary
separation) and families of linear representations of the algebra of matrix
Laurent polynomials. Thanks to the fact that these representations act on
infinite-dimensional carrier spaces in which translation symmetry is restored,
it becomes possible to determine the eigensystem of an auxiliary projected
block-Laurent matrix. This results in an analytic eigenvector Ansatz,
independent of the system size, which we prove is guaranteed to contain the
full solution of the original finite-dimensional problem. The actual solution
is then obtained by imposing compatibility with a boundary matrix, also
independent of system size. As an application, we show analytically that
eigenvectors of short-ranged fermionic tight-binding models may display
power-law corrections to exponential decay, and demonstrate the phenomenon for
the paradigmatic Majorana chain of Kitaev.

such winds can become optically thick enough to block and reprocess the disk
X-ray photons almost entirely, making the source appear as a soft thermal
emitter or ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS). To test this hypothesis
we have studied a ULX where the wind is strong enough to cause significant
absorption of the hard X-ray continuum: NGC 55 ULX. The RGS spectrum of NGC 55
ULX shows a wealth of emission and absorption lines blueshifted by significant
fractions of the light speed (0.01 - 0.20)c indicating the presence of a
powerful wind. The wind has a complex dynamical structure with the ionization
state increasing with the outflow velocity, which may indicate launching from
different regions of the accretion disk. The comparison with other ULXs such as
NGC 1313 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 suggests that NGC 55 ULX is being observed at
higher inclination. The wind partly absorbs the source flux above 1 keV,
generating a spectral drop similar to that observed in ULSs. The softening of
the spectrum at lower (~ Eddington) luminosities and the detection of a soft
lag agree with the scenario of wind clumps crossing the line of sight, partly
absorbing and reprocessing the hard X-rays from the innermost region.

Rank Quasi-Cyclic cryptosystem (RQC), based on the rank metric. We give a
security proof, which reduces the IND-CPA security of our systems to a

quasi-cyclic codes for the Hamming and rank metrics (the respective QCSD and

cryptosystems are very efficient for low encryption rates and are very well
suited to key exchange and authentication. Asymptotically, for \lambda the

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has been extensively used as the tracer of
the photospheric 12C/13C ratio. However, spatially-resolved ALMA observations
of R Scl, a carbon rich AGB star, have shown that the 12CO/13CO ratio is not
consistent over the entire CSE. Hence, it can not necessarily be used as a
tracer of the 12C/13C ratio. The most likely hypothesis to explain the observed
discrepancy between the 12CO/13CO and 12C/13C ratios is CO isotopologue
selective photodissociation by UV radiation. Unlike the CO isotopologue ratio,
the HCN isotopologue ratio is not affected by UV radiation. Therefore, HCN
isotopologue ratios can be used as the tracer of the atomic C ratio in UV
irradiated regions. We have performed a detailed non-LTE excitation analysis of
circumstellar H12CN and H13CN line emission around R Scl, observed with ALMA
and APEX, using a radiative transfer code, ALI. The spatial extent of the
molecular distribution for both isotopologues is constrained based on the
spatially resolved H13CN(4-3) ALMA observations. We find fractional abundances
of H12CN/H2 = (5.0 +\- 2.0) x 10^{-5} and H13CN/H2 = (1.9 +\- 0.4) x 10^{-6} in
the inner wind (r < (2.0 +\- 0.25) x 10^{15} cm) of R Scl. The derived
circumstellar isotopologue ratio of H12CN/H13CN = 26.3 +\- 11.9 is consistent
with the photospheric ratio of 12C/13C ~ 19 \pm 6. We show that the
circumstellar H12CN/H13CN ratio traces the photospheric 12C/13C ratio. These
results support the previously proposed explanation that CO isotopologue
selective-shielding is the main factor responsible for the observed discrepancy
between 12C/13C and 12CO/13CO ratios in the inner CSE of R Scl. This indicates
that UV radiation impacts on the CO isotopologue ratio.

contribution is to introduce importance sampling, specifically, model-reference

parameters, i.e., the weights corresponding to the optimal policy function
approximation given chosen bases. The key idea is to perform the search by
iteratively estimating a parametrized distribution which converges to a Dirac's
Delta that infinitely peaks on the global optimal weights. Then, using this
direct policy search, we incorporated trajectory-based verification to ensure
that, for a class of nonlinear systems, the obtained policy is not only optimal
but robust to bounded disturbances. The correctness and efficiency of the
methods are demonstrated through numerical experiments including linear systems

computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible
with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly
popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and
learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of
deep learning, the gradient descent Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on
the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with
high-precision memory, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in
neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated
weights are not essential for learning deep representations. Random BP replaces
feedback weights with random ones and encourages the network to adjust its
feed-forward weights to learn pseudo-inverses of the (random) feedback weights.
Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule
that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep
representations in neuromorphic computing hardware. The rule requires only one
addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight using a two-compartment
leaky Integrate & Fire (I&F) neuron, making it very suitable for implementation
in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using
eRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving nearly identical
classification accuracies compared to artificial neural network simulations on
GPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during
learning.

stability analysis for the eccentricity growth of circumstellar disks in
binaries, including the effects of gas pressure and viscosity and secular
(orbital-averaged) tidal force from the inclined companion. We find that the
growth of disk eccentricity depends on the dimensionless ratio ($S$) between
$c_{\rm s}^2$ (the disk sound speed squared) and the tidal torque acting on the
disk (per unit mass) from the companion. For $S\ll 1$, the standard Lidov-Kozai
result is recovered for a thin disk annulus: eccentricity excitation occurs
when the mutual inclination $I$ between the disk and binary lies between
$39^\circ$ and $141^\circ$. As $S$ increases, the inclination window for
eccentricity growth generally becomes narrower. For $S\gtrsim$ a few,
eccentricity growth is suppressed for all inclination angles. Surprisingly, we
find that for $S\sim 1$ and certain disk density/pressure profiles,
eccentricity excitation can occur even when $I$ is much less than $39^\circ$.

signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the systematic errors in the estimated

with all the relevant modes. Target signals including nonquadrupole modes are
constructed by matching numerical-relativity simulations of nonprecessing black

find that neglecting nonquadrupole modes will, in general, cause unacceptable

For a given mass ratio, neglecting subdominant modes will result in a larger
loss in the detection rate for binaries with aligned spins. For binaries with
antialigned spins, quadrupole-mode templates are more effectual in detection,
at the cost of introducing a larger systematic bias in the parameter

emerged as powerful new approaches to control the electronic and atomic-scale

based on RENiO$_3$, where RE is a trivalent rare-earth cation, have been shown
to be relevant model systems since the orbital occupancy, degeneracy, and,
consequently, the electronic/magnetic properties can be altered as a function
of epitaxial strain, layer thickness and superlattice structure. One such
recent example is the tri-component LaTiO$_3$-LaNiO$_3$-LaAlO$_3$ superlattice,
which exhibits charge transfer and orbital polarization as the result of its
interfacial dipole electric field. A crucial step towards control of these
parameters for future electronic and magnetic device applications is to develop
an understanding of both the magnitude and range of the octahedral network's
response towards interfacial strain and electric fields. An approach that
provides atomic-scale resolution and sensitivity towards the local octahedral
distortions and orbital occupancy is therefore required. Here, we employ
atomic-resolution imaging coupled with electron spectroscopies and first
principles theory to examine the role of interfacial charge transfer and
symmetry breaking in a tricomponent nickelate superlattice system. We find that
nearly complete charge transfer occurs between the LaTiO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$
layers, resulting in a Ni$^{2+}$ valence state. We further demonstrate that
this charge transfer is highly localized with a range of about 1 unit cell,
within the LaNiO$_3$ layers. The results presented here provide important
feedback to synthesis efforts aimed at stabilizing new electronic phases that

structure which, when queried on two points $u,v \in V$, returns an

work on the tradeoff between the important parameters of approximate distance
oracles (and in particular between the size, stretch, and query time), but in
this paper we take a different point of view, that of per-instance
optimization. If we are given an particular input metric space and stretch
bound, can we find the smallest possible approximate distance oracle for that
particular input? Since this question is not even well-defined, we restrict our
attention to well-known classes of approximate distance oracles, and study

generalise the Jeans escape parameter taking hydrodynamic and Roche lobe
effects into account. We furthermore define $\Lambda$ as the value of the Jeans
escape parameter calculated at the observed planetary radius and mass for the
planet's equilibrium temperature and considering atomic hydrogen, independently
of the atmospheric temperature profile. We consider 5 and 10 $M_{\oplus}$
planets with an equilibrium temperature of 500 and 1000 K, orbiting early G-,
K-, and M-type stars. Assuming a clear atmosphere and by comparing escape rates
obtained from the energy-limited formula, which only accounts for the heating
induced by the absorption of the high-energy stellar radiation, and from a
hydrodynamic atmosphere code, which also accounts for the bolometric heating,
we find that planets whose $\Lambda$ is smaller than 15-35 lie in the
""boil-off"" regime, where the escape is driven by the atmospheric thermal energy
and low planetary gravity. We find that the atmosphere of hot (i.e. $T_{\rm

planets with $\Lambda$ < 15-35 shrinks to smaller radii so that their $\Lambda$
evolves to values higher than 15-35, hence out of the boil-off regime, in less
than $\approx$500 Myr. Because of their small Roche lobe radius, we find the
same result also for hot (i.e. $T_{\rm eq}\gtrapprox$ 1000 K) higher mass
($M_{\rm pl}\lessapprox$ 10 $M_{\oplus}$) planets with $\Lambda$ < 15-35, when
they orbit M-dwarfs. For old, hydrogen-dominated planets in this range of
parameters, $\Lambda$ should therefore be $\geq$15-35, which provides a strong
constraint on the planetary minimum mass and maximum radius and can be used to

formation efficiency (SFE) between these two regimes. The simulations include
prescriptions for supernova, stellar wind, and radiative feedback, which we
find to be essential in determining both the instantaneous per-freefall
($\epsilon_{ff}$) and integrated ($\epsilon_{int}$) star formation
efficiencies. In all simulations, the gas disks form stars until a critical
stellar surface density has been reached and the remaining gas is blown out by
stellar feedback. We find that surface density is a good predictor of
$\epsilon_{int}$, as suggested by analytic force balance arguments from
previous works. SFE eventually saturates to $\sim 1$ at high surface density.
We also find a proportional relationship between $\epsilon_{ff}$ and
$\epsilon_{int}$, implying that star formation is feedback-moderated even over
very short time-scales in isolated clouds. These results have implications for
star formation in galactic disks, the nature and fate of nuclear starbursts,
and the formation of bound star clusters. The scaling of $\epsilon_{ff}$ with
surface density is not consistent with the notion that $\epsilon_{ff}$ is
always $\sim 1\%$ on the scale of GMCs, but our predictions recover the $\sim
1\%$ value for GMC parameters similar to those found in sprial galaxies,

space and based on measurements of the first two even multipole moments of the
anisotropic galaxy auto-correlation function, in two redshift bins spanning the
range $0.5 < z < 1.2$. We provide robust and cosmology-independent corrections
for the VIPERS angular selection function, allowing recovery of the underlying
clustering amplitude at the percent level down to the Mpc scale. We discuss
several improvements on the non-linear modelling of redshift-space distortions
(RSD) and perform detailed tests of a variety of approaches against a set of
realistic VIPERS-like mock realisations. This includes using novel fitting
functions to describe the velocity divergence and density power spectra
$P_{\theta\theta}$ and $P_{\delta\theta}$ that appear in RSD models. These
tests show that we are able to measure the growth rate with negligible bias
down to separations of $5h^{-1}Mpc$. Interestingly, the application to real
data shows a weaker sensitivity to the details of non-linear RSD corrections
compared to mock results. We obtain consistent values for the growth rate times
the matter power spectrum normalisation parameter of $f\sigma_8=0.55\pm 0.12$
and $0.40\pm0.11$ at effective redshifts of $z = 0.6$ and $z=0.86$
respectively. These results are in agreement with standard cosmology
predictions assuming Einstein gravity in a $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ background.

lensing, with the aim of measuring the growth rate of structure; this is a key
quantity for understanding the nature of gravity on cosmological scales and
late-time cosmic acceleration. We make use of the final VIPERS redshift survey
dataset, which maps a portion of the Universe at a redshift of $z \simeq 0.8$,
and the lensing data from the CFHTLenS survey over the same area of the sky. We
build a consistent theoretical model that combines non-linear galaxy biasing
and redshift-space distortion models, and confront it with observations. The
two probes are combined in a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis to determine
the growth rate of structure at two redshifts $z=0.6$ and $z=0.86$. We obtain
measurements of $f\sigma_8(0.6) = 0.48 \pm 0.12$ and $f\sigma_8(0.86) = 0.48
\pm 0.10$. The additional galaxy-galaxylensing constraint alleviates galaxy
bias and $\sigma_8$ degeneracies, providing direct measurements of

$f(0.86),\sigma_8(0.86)] = [0.99 \pm 0.19, 0.48 \pm 0.04]$. These measurements
are statistically consistent with a Universe where the gravitational
interactions can be described by General Relativity, although they are not yet
accurate enough to rule out some commonly considered alternatives. Finally, as
a complementary test we measure the gravitational slip parameter, $E_G$ , for
the first time at $z>0.6$. We find values of $\smash{\overline{E}_G}(0.6) =
0.16 \pm 0.09$ and $\smash{\overline{E}_G}(0.86) = 0.09 \pm 0.07$, when $E_G$
is averaged over scales above $3 h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}$. We find that our $E_G$

explained by standard models of secondary CR production in the interstellar

to increase at energy above ~50 of GeV/nucleon, in conflict with new precision

real physical effect, hadronic production of CR deuterons must occur in SNRs
characterized by low metal abundance. In such a scenario, the sources
accelerating C-N-O nuclei are not the same as those accelerating helium or

the latter cannot be used to place constraints on the production of light

of IMF variability with galactic properties. We do so by tagging stellar
particles in the simulation (each representing a stellar population of
$\approx10^{6}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with individual IMFs that depend on various
physical conditions, such as velocity dispersion, metallicity, or SFR, at the
time and place the stars are formed. We then follow the assembly of these
populations throughout cosmic time, and reconstruct the overall IMF of each
$z=0$ galaxy from the many distinct IMFs it is comprised of. Our main result is
that applying the observed relations between IMF and galactic properties to the
conditions at the star-formation sites does not result in strong enough IMF
variations between $z = 0$ galaxies. Steeper physical IMF relations are
required for reproducing the observed IMF trends, and some stellar populations
must form with more extreme IMFs than those observed. The origin of this result
is the hierarchical nature of massive galaxy assembly, and it has implications
for the reliability of the strong observed trends, for the ability of
cosmological simulations to capture certain physical conditions in galaxies,

frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is designed to accelerate a 30-keV, 1-mA to 10-mA,
H- beam to 2.1 MeV under both pulsed and continuous wave (CW) RF operation. The
available headroom of the RF amplifiers limits the maximum allowable detuning
to 3 kHz, and the detuning is controlled entirely via thermal regulation. Fine
control over the detuning, minimal manual intervention, and fast trip recovery
is desired. In addition, having active control over both the walls and vanes
provides a wider tuning range. For this, we intend to use model predictive
control (MPC). To facilitate these objectives, we developed a dedicated control
framework that handles higher-level system decisions as well as executes
control calculations. It is written in Python in a modular fashion for easy
adjustments, readability, and portability. Here we describe the framework and
present the first control results for the PI-Test RFQ under pulsed and CW
operation.

neural ideal was introduced recently as an algebraic object that can be used to
better understand the combinatorial structure of neural codes. Every neural
ideal has a particular generating set, called the canonical form, that directly
encodes a minimal description of the receptive field structure intrinsic to the
neural code. On the other hand, for a given monomial order, any polynomial
ideal is also generated by its unique (reduced) Gr\""obner basis with respect to
that monomial order. How are these two types of generating sets -- canonical
forms and Gr\""obner bases -- related? Our main result states that if the
canonical form of a neural ideal is a Gr\""obner basis, then it is the universal
Gr\""obner basis (that is, the union of all reduced Gr\""obner bases).
Furthermore, we prove that this situation -- when the canonical form is a
Gr\""obner basis -- occurs precisely when the universal Gr\""obner basis contains
only pseudo-monomials (certain generalizations of monomials). Our results
motivate two questions: (1)~When is the canonical form a Gr\""obner basis?
(2)~When the universal Gr\""obner basis of a neural ideal is {\em not} a
canonical form, what can the non-pseudo-monomial elements in the basis tell us
about the receptive fields of the code? We give partial answers to both
questions. Along the way, we develop a representation of pseudo-monomials as
hypercubes in a Boolean lattice.

increased spin-currents on the surface of the thin film. This enhancement is a
direct consequence of the broken symmetry originating from the surface

induced by spin-orbit coupling. After the first $\sim 40$ fs this changes in
that the dominant cause of demagnetization is the flow of spin-currents, which

iPTF13bvn is unique in the sense that a corresponding pre-supernova image has

progenitor. From the pre-supernova image, light curve and the latest
observations, it is currently widely accepted that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn
was in a binary system. The fast decline in the light curve suggests a
progenitor mass of $\sim3.5M_\odot$, and the upper limit on the remaining
companion is $\sim20M_\odot$. Recent works suggest that binary evolution models
involving common envelope episodes can satisfy all the observational
constraints. We have examined the common envelope scenario based on latest

molecular cloud turbulence, and differences in the driving can produce an order
of magnitude difference in the star formation rate. The turbulent driving is
characterised by the parameter $\zeta$, with $\zeta=0$ for compressive,
curl-free driving (e.g. accretion or supernova explosions), and $\zeta=1$ for
solenoidal, divergence-free driving (e.g. Galactic shear). Here we develop a
new method to measure $\zeta$ from observations of synchrotron emission from
molecular clouds. We calculate statistics of mock synchrotron intensity images
produced from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, in which the
driving was controlled to produce different values of $\zeta$. We find that the
mean and standard deviation of the log-normalised synchrotron intensity are
sensitive to $\zeta$, for values of $\zeta$ between $0$ (curl-free driving) and
$0.5$ (naturally-mixed driving). We quantify the dependence of zeta on the
direction of the magnetic field relative to the line of sight. We provide
best-fit formulae for $\zeta$ in terms of the log-normalised mean and standard
deviation of synchrotron intensity, with which $\zeta$ can be determined for
molecular clouds that have similar Alfv\'enic Mach number to our simulations.
These formulae are independent of the sonic Mach number. Signal-to-noise ratios
larger than $5$, and angular resolutions smaller than $5\%$ of the cloud
diameter, are required to apply these formulae. Although there are no firm
detections of synchrotron emission from molecular clouds, by combining Green
Bank Telescope and Very Large Array observations it should be possible to
detect synchrotron emission from molecular clouds, thereby constraining the
value of $\zeta$.

integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), i.e. for a given deformation,
the first-level optimization is a typical linear constrained 0-1 programming
problem, while for a given structure, the second-level optimization is a
general nonlinear continuous minimization problem in computational nonlinear
elasticity. It is discovered that for linear elastic structures, first-level
optimization is a typical Knapsack problem, which is considered to be
NP-complete in computer science. However, by using canonical duality theory,
this well-known problem can be solved analytically to obtain exact integer
solution. A perturbed canonical dual algorithm (CDT) is proposed and
illustrated by benchmark problems in topology optimization. Numerical results
show that the proposed CDT method produces desired optimal structure without

costly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator
based upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement
learning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator.
Dialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting
point. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real

empirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new,
publicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the

supports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we
demonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own

and extra-Galactic molecular clouds (MCs), and in their ability to form stars
have been attributed to local variations in the magnitude of interstellar
pressure. Inferences from these surveys have called into question two
long-standing beliefs that the MCs : 1 are Virialised entities and (2) have
approximately constant surface density i.e., the validity of the Larson's third
law. In this work we invoke the framework of cloud-formation via collisions
between warm gas flows. Post-collision clouds forming in these realisations
cool rapidly and evolve primarily via the interplay between the Non-linear Thin
Shell Instability (NTSI), and the self-gravity. Over the course of these
simulations we traced the temporal evolution of the surface density of the
assembled clouds, the fraction of dense gas, the distribution of gas column
density (NPDF), and the Virial nature of the assembled clouds. We conclude,
these physical properties of MCs not only exhibit temporal variation, but their
respective peak-magnitude also increases in proportion with the magnitude of
external pressure, $P_{ext}$. The velocity dispersion in assembled clouds
appears to follow the power-law, $\sigma_{gas}\propto P_{ext}^{0.23}$. Also,
the power-law tail at higher densities becomes shallower with increasing
magnitude of external pressure, for magnitudes, $P_{ext}/k_{B}\lesssim 10^{7}$
K cm$^{-3}$, at higher magnitudes such as those typically found in the Galactic
CMZ ($P_{ext}/k_{B} > 10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$), the power-law shows significant
steepening. Thus while our results are broadly consistent with inferences from
various recent observational surveys, it appears, MCs hardly exhibit a unique
set of properties, but rather a wide variety, that can be reconciled with a
range of magnitudes of pressure between 10$^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$ - 10$^{8}$ K
cm$^{-3}$.

One-zone leptonic models for blazar emission are severely constrained by the
short timescale variability that implies a very compact emission region at a
distance of hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. Here,
we investigate a hadronic scenario where GeV $\gamma$-rays are produced via
proton synchrotron radiation. We also take into account the effects of the
hadronically initiated electromagnetic cascades (EMC). For a $\gamma$-ray
emitting region in rough equipartition between particles and kG magnetic
fields, located within the broad-line region (BLR), the development of EMC
redistributes the $\gamma$-ray luminosity to softer energy bands and eventually
leads to broad-band spectra that differ from the observed ones. Suppression of
EMC and energy equipartition are still possible, if the $\gamma$-ray emitting
region is located beyond the BLR, is fast moving with Doppler factor ($>70$),
and contains strong magnetic fields ($>100$ G). Yet, these conditions cannot be
easily met in parsec-scale jets, thus disfavouring a proton synchrotron origin

shocks, although the results can be applied more broadly. Our formalism
emphasizes the importance of the relative Mach number of the impacting ICM flow

There are two spectrum sellers, who are two primary networks, each with an
amount of licensed spectrum bandwidth. When a seller has some unused spectrum,
it would like to lease the unused spectrum to secondary users. A coordinator
helps to perform the spectrum leasing stage-by-stage. As the two sellers may
have different leasing period, there are three epochs, in which seller 1 has
spectrum to lease in Epochs II and III, while seller 2 has spectrum to lease in
Epochs I and II. Each seller needs to decide how much spectrum it should lease
to secondary users in each stage of its leasing period, with a target at
revenue maximization. It is shown that, when the two sellers both have spectrum
to lease (i.e., in Epoch II), the spectrum leasing can be formulated as a
non-cooperative game. Nash equilibria of the game are found in closed form.
Solutions of the two users in the three epochs are derived.

the morphology of the ionization field, while the small scale absorbers
dominate the mean free path of ionizing photons, and also delay and prolong the

reduced by an order of magnitude in the presence of dense absorbers.

networks based on the transmitters' buffer state information and their
transceivers' duplex transmission capability. First, we investigate the case of
half-duplex nodes where a node can either transmit or receive in a given time
instant. The network is said to be naturally sparse if the number of
nonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of
users, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small
and the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we
design the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to
the destination. We refer to the detected nonempty-queue transmitters in a
given frame as frame owners. Our design goal is to minimize the nodes' total
transmit power in a given frame. In the case of unslotted-time data
transmission, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex optimization
program. We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and
obtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes.
The solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time
duration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the
square-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots
of each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time
data transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data
transmission are slotted. In addition, we show that the full-duplex capability
of a node increases the data transmission portion of the frame and enables a
distributed implementation of the proposed schemes.

approximation in describing lensing behaviors of either a very wide or a very
close binary lens. C-R lensing events, which are identified by short-term
anomalies near the peak of a high-magnification lensing light curves, are
routinely detected from lensing surveys, but not much attention is paid to
them. In this paper, we point out that C-R lensing events provide an important
channel to detect planets in binaries, both in close and wide binary systems.
Detecting planets through the C-R lensing event channel is possible because the
planet-induced perturbation occurs in the same region of the C-R
lensing-induced anomaly and thus the existence of the planet can be identified
by the additional deviation in the central perturbation. By presenting the
analysis of the actually observed C-R lensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1319, we
demonstrate that dense and high-precision coverage of a C-R lensing-induced
perturbation can provide a strong constraint on the existence of a planet in
the wide range of the planet parameters. The sample of an increased number of
microlensing planets in binary systems will provide important observational

  measurements","12 pages plus 4 pages Appendices, 12 Figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider three modes $A$, $B$ and $C$ and derive continuous variable
monogamy inequalities that constrain the distribution of bipartite entanglement
amongst the three modes. The inequalities hold for all such tripartite states,
without the assumption of Gaussian states, and are based on measurements of two
conjugate quadrature phase amplitudes $X_{i}$ and $P_{i}$ at each mode $i=A,B$.
The first monogamy inequality is $D_{BA}+D_{BC}\geq1$ where $D_{BA}<1$ is the
widely used symmetric entanglement criterion, for which $D_{BA}$ is the sum of
the variances of $(X_{A}-X_{B})/2$ and $(P_{A}+P_{B})/2$. A second monogamy
inequality is
$Ent_{BA}Ent_{BC}\geq\frac{1}{\left(1+(g_{BA}^{(sym)})^{2}\right)\left(1+(g_{BC}^{(sym)})^{2}\right)}$
where $Ent_{BA}<1$ is the EPR variance product criterion for entanglement. Here
$Ent_{BA}$ is a normalised product of variances of $X_{B}-g_{BA}^{(sym)}X_{A}$
and $P_{B}+g_{BA}^{(sym)}P_{A}$, and $g_{BA}^{(sym)}$ is a parameter that gives
a measure of the symmetry between the moments of $A$ and $B$. We also show that
the monogamy bounds are increased if a standard steering criterion for the
steering of $B$ is not satisfied. We illustrate the monogamy for continuous
variable tripartite entangled states including the effects of losses and noise,
and identify regimes of saturation of the inequalities. The monogamy relations
explain the experimentally observed saturation at $D_{AB}=0.5$ for the
entanglement between $A$ and $B$ when both modes have 50\% losses, and may be
useful to establish rigorous bounds of correlation for the purpose of quantum
key distribution protocols.

A coupled-channel methodology in momentum space is used to solve

[1-5] in which the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) scattering amplitude acts as input to
derive the SEM amplitude using partial wave analysis, is utilized to study the
s-, p-, d- wave elastic phase shifts and the corresponding partial cross
sections. An augmented-Born approximation is used to include the contribution
of higher partial waves more accurately to determine the total/integrated
elastic cross sections. The effective range theory is used to determine the
scattering lengths and effective ranges in the s-wave elastic scattering. The
systems studied are Ps-Ps, Ps-Mu, Ps-H, Ps-D, Ps-T, Mu-Mu, Mu-H, Mu-D, Mu-T,

web-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic
emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets,
captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity
between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological
model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include:
text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine
automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of
semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The
main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under
the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search
engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through
tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions.
Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative
tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g.
Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to
each single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a
deeper level of abstraction, aiming at recognizing specific emotions and not
only the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic
data.

the kinematic reach of the data constraints. We now allow much more freedom for
the flavour dependence of nuclear effects than in other currently available

flavour by flavour. The neutrino DIS plays a pivotal role in obtaining a
mutually consistent behaviour for both up and down valence quarks, and the LHC

insufficient statistics, the pion-nucleus DY and heavy gauge boson production
in proton-lead collisions impose less visible constraints. The outcome - a new

neither eliminating the interference nor adopting joint detection at the relays
nodes. Improper signaling is a powerful signaling scheme that has the
capability to reduce the interference impact at the receiver side and improves
the achievable rate performance. Therefore, improper signaling is adopted at
both relays, which have access to the global CSI. Then, improper signal
characteristics are designed to maximize the total end-to-end achievable rate
at the relays. To this end, both the power and the circularity coefficient, a
measure of the impropriety degree of the signal, are optimized at the relays.
Although the optimization problem is not convex, optimal power allocation for
both relays for a fixed circularity coefficient is obtained. Moreover, the
circularity coefficient is tuned to maximize the rate for a given power
allocation. Finally, a joint solution of the optimization problem is proposed
using a coordinate descent method based on alternate optimization. The
simulation results show that employing improper signaling improves the

combinatorial random walks. These processes behave differently than random
walks and Levy processes on other state spaces. Standard examples include
processes on sets, graphs, and n-ary relations, but the framework permits far
more general possibilities. The main theorems characterize both finite and

Hoffman--Wielandt theorem states that there exists a permutation $\pi$ of

either $A$ or $\widetilde{A}$ is non-normal, this result does not hold in

In both models, the velocity is a function of a convolution product between the
unknown and a kernel function with compact support. It turns out that the
solutions of such equations may exhibit oscillations that are very difficult to
approximate using classical first-order numerical schemes. We propose to design
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and Finite Volume WENO (FV-WENO) schemes to
obtain high-order approximations. As we will see, the DG schemes give the best
numerical results but their CFL condition is very restrictive. On the contrary,
FV-WENO schemes can be used with larger time steps. We will see that the
evaluation of the convolution terms necessitates the use of quadratic

accuracy with the FV-WENO approach. Simulations using DG and FV-WENO schemes

drawbacks. They require a large number of executions to identify faults, they
might be adversely affected by coincidental correctness, and they do not take
into consideration fault-proneness associated with different parts of the
program code while constructing behavioral models. Additionally, they do not
consider the simultaneous impact of predicates on program termination status.
To deal with mentioned problems, a new fault-proneness-aware approach based on
elastic net regression, namely FPA-Debug has been proposed in this paper.
FPA-Debug employs a clustering-based strategy to alleviate coincidental
correctness in fault localization and finds the smallest effective subset of
program predicates known as bug predictors. Moreover, the approach considers
fault-proneness of code during statistical modeling through applying different
regularization parameter to each program predicates depending on its location
within program source code. The experimental results on well-known test suite,
Siemens, reveal the effectiveness and accuracy of the FPA-Debug.

taken at temperatures from 3-350 K and microwave frequencies from 9.2-9.8 and
34 GHz. In the paramagnetic phase, magnetic resonance spectra are determined by
magnetic dipole and exchange interactions between Eu2+ spins. In the film, a
large contribution arises from the demagnetization field. From detailed
analysis of the linewidth and its temperature dependence, the parameters of
spin-spin interactions were determined: the exchange frequency is 15-15.5 GHz
and the estimated critical exponent of the spin correlation length is ~ 0.5. In
the bulk samples, the spectra exhibited a distinct minimum in the linewidth at
the N\'eel temperature, T_N = 5.5 K, while the resonance field practically does
not change even on cooling below T_N. This is indicative of a small magnetic
anisotropy ~ 320 G in the antiferromagnetic phase. In the film, the magnetic
resonance spectrum is split below T_N into several components due to excitation
of the magnetostatic modes, corresponding to a non-uniform precession of
magnetization. Moreover, the film was observed to degrade over two years. This
was manifested by an increase of defects and a change in the domain structure.
The saturated magnetization in the film, estimated from the magnetic resonance
spectrum, was about 900 emu/cm3 or 5.5 mu_B/unit cell at T = 3.5 K.

x-ray or neutron scattering, and applies Nelder-Mead method to find the
solution. Since it is known that Ornstein-Zernike equation coupled with the

removing insulation and allowing thinner copper stabilizer, NI REBCO magnets
have significantly higher engineering current density and higher mechanical
strength. On the other hand, NI REBCO magnets have drawbacks of long magnet
charging time and high field-ramp-loss. In principle, these drawbacks can be
mitigated by managing the turn-to-turn contact resistivity (Rc). Evidently the
first step toward managing Rc is to establish a reliable method of accurate Rc
measurement. In this paper, we present experimental Rc measurements of REBCO
tapes as a function of mechanical load up to 144 MPa and load cycles up to 14

increasing pressure, and gradually increases with number of load cycles. The
results are discussed in the framework of Holm's electric contact theory.

alternative form of particle theory. This theory obeys the fundamental
symmetries which are required to hold for any meaningful theory: gauge and
Lorentz covariance (RST can be formulated even over a pseudo-Riemannian
space-time). But the question is now whether obeying those fundamental
symmetries is sufficient for the practical success of a theory, i.e. whether
the predictions are in agreement with the experimental findings. In this
context, the non-relativistic energy spectrum of positronium has been
considered in some precedent papers. Here, the problem is that exact solutions
of the RST eigenvalue system cannot be obtained and one has to resort to
approximate solutions. For this purpose, a variational method is applied in the
present paper which yields the RST groundstate energy smaller than the former
results and than its conventional counterpart by some 10\%. Such deviations are
also observed when one compares the approximate RST spectrum (up to quantum
numbers $n\approx 100$) to the corresponding predictions of the conventional
theory. It seems presently not possible to decide whether those deviations are
due to RST itself or are merely due to the applied approximation technique.
Thus the practical usefulness of RST must remain unclarified for the moment.
