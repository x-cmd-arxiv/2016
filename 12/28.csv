using quantum shot noise. Under dc voltage bias $V$, spectral density of noise
measured within a very large bandwidth enables to deduce the current-current
correlator in the time domain by Fourier transform. This correlator exhibits
regular oscillations proving that electrons try to cross the junction
regularly, every $h/eV$. Using harmonic and bi-harmonic ac voltage bias, we
then show that quasiparticles excitations can be transferred through the
junction in a controlled way. By measuring the reduction of the excess shot
noise, we are able to determine the number of electron-hole pairs surrounding
the injected electrons and demonstrate that bi-harmonic voltage pulses realize
an on-demand electron source with a very small admixture of electron-hole
pairs.

systems have recently been proposed as a novel combination of spatial
modulation (SM) and of conventional massive MIMO, where the base station (BS)
is equipped with a large number of antennas and simultaneously serves multiple
user equipment (UE) that employ SM for their uplink transmission. Since the
massive SM-MIMO concept combines the benefits of both the SM and massive MIMO
techniques, it has recently attracted substantial research interest. In this
paper, we study the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a multi-cell
massive SM-MIMO system, and derive closed-form expressions to asymptotically
lower-bound the SE yielded by two linear BS combining schemes, including
maximum ratio (MR) combining and zero forcing (ZF) combining, when a
sufficiently large number of BS antennas are equipped. The derivation takes
into account the impact of transmitter spatial correlations, of imperfect
channel estimations, of user-specific power controls and of different pilot
reuse factors. The proposed asymptotic bounds are shown to be tight, even when
the scale of BS antennas is limited. The new SE results facilitate a
system-level investigation of the optimal number of uplink transmit antennas
(TAs) $N$ with respect to SE maximization. Explicitly, we provide theoretical
insights on the SE of massive SM-MIMO systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
massive SM-MIMO systems are capable of outperforming the SE of conventional
massive MIMOs relying on single-TA UEs.

hexagonal SiC sheet, we identified two types of hitherto-unknown structural
motifs with distinctive bonding features. The first type of 2D SiC monolayer,
including t-SiC and t-Si$_2$C sheet, can be described by tetragonal lattice.
Among them,t-SiC monolayer sheet is featured by each carbon atom binds with
four neighboring silicon atoms in almost the same plane, constituting a
quasi-planar four-coordinated rectangular moiety. More interestingly, our
calculations demonstrate that this structure exhibits a strain-dependent
insulator-semimetal transition, suggesting promising applications in
strain-dependent optoelectronic sensors. The second type of 2D SiC sheet is
featured by silagraphyne with acetylenic linkages(-C$\equiv$C-). Silagraphyne
shows both high pore sizes and Poisson's ratio. These properties make them a
potentially important material for applications in separation membranes and
catalysis. Moreover, one of the proposed structures, $\gamma$-silagraphyne, is
a direct-band-gap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.89 eV, which has a strong
absorption peak in the visible-light region, giving a promising application in
ultra-thin transistors, optical sensor devices and solar cell devices.

atomic MAE of 72-200 meV with room temperature structural stability. The huge
MAE originates from degenerate orbitals around Fermi level. More importantly,
we developed a simplified quantum mechanical model to understand the principle
on how to obtain giant MAE for supported magnetic structures. These discoveries
and mechanisms provide a paradigm to design giant atomic MAE in nanostructures.

quadratically in the length. This paper gives an analogue on K3 surfaces, by
considering special Lagrangian tori. The analogue of the angle of a billiard
trajectory is a point on a twistor sphere, and the number of directions
admitting a special Lagrangian torus fibration with volume bounded by $ V $
grows like $ V^{20} $ with a power-saving term. Bergeron--Matheus have
explicitly estimated the exponent of the error term as $ {20-\frac{4}{697633}

version of the optical theorem for the scattering of elastic waves by a
spherical inclusion embedded in a linear elastic solid using a vector spherical
harmonics representation of the waves. The sphere can be a rigid, empty cavity,
elastic, viscoelastic, or layered material. The theorem expresses the
extinction cross-section, i.e. the time-averaged power extracted from the
incoming beam per its intensity, regarding the partial-wave expansion
coefficients of the incident and scattered waves. We establish the optical
theorem for a longitudinal spherically focused beam scattered by a sphere.
Moreover, we use the optical theorem formalism to obtain the radiation force
exerted on an inclusion by an incident plane wave and focused beam. Considering
an iron sphere embedded in an aluminum matrix, we compute the scattering and
elastic radiation force efficiencies. In addition, the elastic radiation force
is obtained on a stainless steel sphere embedded in a tissue-like medium (soft
solid). Remarkably, we find a relative difference of up to $98\%$ between our
findings and previous lossless liquid models. Regarding some applications, the
obtained results have a direct impact on ultrasound-based elastography

(dG) schemes that preserve maximum principles at the discrete level for the
steady transport and convection-diffusion problems and the respective transient
problems with implicit time integration. Monotonic schemes that combine
explicit time stepping with dG space discretization are very common, but the
design of such schemes for implicit time stepping is rare, and it had only been
attained so far for 1D problems. The proposed scheme is based on an artificial
diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the
troublesome areas. In order to define the new shock detector, we have
introduced the concept of discrete local extrema. The diffusion operator is a
graph-Laplacian, instead of the more common finite element discretization of
the Laplacian operator, which is essential to keep monotonicity on general
meshes and in multi-dimension. The resulting nonlinear stabilization is
non-smooth and nonlinear solvers can fail to converge. As a result, we propose
a smoothed (twice differentiable) version of the nonlinear stabilization, which
allows us to use Newton with line search nonlinear solvers and dramatically
improve nonlinear convergence. A theoretical numerical analysis of the proposed
schemes show that they satisfy the desired monotonicity properties. Further,
the resulting operator is Lipschitz continuous and there exists at least one
solution of the discrete problem, even in the non-smooth version. We provide a
set of numerical results to support our findings.

function (JPDF) of the height of the KPZ equation with droplet initial
conditions, at two different times $t_1<t_2$, in the limit where both times are
large and their ratio $t_2/t_1$ is fixed. This maps to the JPDF of the free
energies of two directed polymers with two different lengths and in the same
random potential. Using the replica Bethe ansatz (RBA) method, we obtain the
exact tail of the JPDF when one of its argument (the KPZ height at the earlier
time $t_1$) is large and positive. Our formula interpolates between two limits
where the JPDF decouples: (i) for $t_2/t_1 \to +\infty$ into a product of two
GUE Tracy-Widom (TW) distributions, and (ii) for $t_2/t_1 \to 1^+$ into a
product of a GUE-TW distribution and a Baik-Rains distribution (associated to
stationary KPZ evolution). The lowest cumulants of the height at time $t_2$,
conditioned on the one at time $t_1$, are expressed analytically as expansions
around these limits, and computed numerically for arbitrary $t_2/t_1$. Moreover
we compute the connected two-time correlation, conditioned to a large enough
value at $t_1$, providing a quantitative prediction for the so-called
persistence of correlations (or ergodicity breaking) in the time evolution from
the droplet initial condition. Our RBA results are then compared with arguments
based on Airy processes, with satisfactory agreement. These predictions are
universal for all models in the KPZ class and should be testable in experiments

tight-binding fit to the first principles band structure shows that
nearest-neighbor hopping plays a dominant role while second-neighbor hopping
breaks the particle-hole symmetry and determines the finer band features. The
four bands of the LaNiO$_3$ bilayer exhibit both quadratic band touching points

independently tune the first and second-neighbor hopping for fixed frequency,
which leads to considerable control over the Floquet band structure. We
investigate this control in detail, and study how the quadratic and Dirac band
touchings are influenced by the polarization and intensity of the light. We
derive effective 2-band Hamiltonians (for both quadratic and Dirac band
touching points) that accurately captures these results. We further study an
extended model which explicitly includes oxygen $p$-orbitals and compare the

distributed according to a power law, with cubic exponent. This is a
fascinating regularity, as it holds for various classes of securities, on
various markets, and on various time scales. The universality of this law
suggests that there must be some basic, general and stable mechanism behind it.
The standard (neoclassical) paradigm implies no such mechanism. Agent-based
models of financial markets, on the other hand, exhibit realistic price
changes, but they involve relatively complicated, and often mathematically
intractable, mechanisms. This paper identifies a simple principle behind the
power law: the feedback intrinsic to the very idea of speculation, namely
buying when one expects a price rise (and selling when one expects a price
fall). By this feedback, price changes follow a random coefficient
autoregressive process, and therefore they have a power law by Kesten theorem.

the five pockets made out of $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, and $d_{xy}$ orbitals and
argue that there are 40 different interactions between low-energy fermions in
the orbital basis. All interactions flow under RG, as one progressively
integrates out fermions with higher energies. We find that the low-energy
behavior is amazingly simple, despite the large number of interactions. Namely,
at low-energies the full 5-pocket model effectively reduces either to a
3-pocket model made of one $d_{xy}$ hole pocket and two electron pockets, or a
4-pocket model made of two $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ hole pockets and two electron
pockets. The leading instability in the effective 4-pocket model is a
spontaneous orbital (nematic) order, followed by $s^{+-}$ superconductivity. In
the effective 3-pocket model orbital fluctuations are weaker, and the system
develops either $s^{+-}$ superconductivity or stripe SDW. In the latter case,
nematicity is induced by composite spin fluctuations.

may be viewed as effective three-body reactions and described with Faddeev
techniques. An additional challenge posed by $(d,p)$ reactions involving
heavier nuclei is the treatment of the Coulomb force. To avoid numerical
complications in dealing with the screening of the Coulomb force, recently a
new approach using the Coulomb distorted basis in momentum space was suggested.
In order to implement this suggestion separable representations of neutron- and
proton-nucleus optical potentials, which are not only complex but also energy

specific task of semantic image understanding to achieve higher visual quality
in lossy compression. A modest increase in complexity is incorporated to the
encoder which allows a standard, off-the-shelf jpeg decoder to be used. While
jpeg encoding may be optimized for generic images, the process is ultimately
unaware of the specific content of the image to be compressed. Our technique
makes jpeg content-aware by designing and training a model to identify multiple
semantic regions in a given image. Unlike object detection techniques, our
model does not require labeling of object positions and is able to identify
objects in a single pass. We present a new cnn architecture directed
specifically to image compression, which generates a map that highlights
semantically-salient regions so that they can be encoded at higher quality as
compared to background regions. By adding a complete set of features for every
class, and then taking a threshold over the sum of all feature activations, we
generate a map that highlights semantically-salient regions so that they can be
encoded at a better quality compared to background regions. Experiments are
presented on the Kodak PhotoCD dataset and the MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset,

clustering problem is linked to finding the largest maximal cliques in a graph.
We show that the method can be used with both clustering and classification

scattered starlight contaminates the observed spectrum of reddened stars. The
present paper develops this new paradigm by providing a better understanding of
the characteristics of this scattered light. It further examines the
consequences of this revision of interstellar extinction theory for
interpreting the 2200 \AA\ bump and the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Two
implications are worth noting: (1) the effect of interstellar extinction on
cosmic distance estimations needs to be reconsidered; (2) it is unnecessary to
invoke hypothetical particles, such as Poly Aromatic Hydrogenated molecules
(PAHs), to explain the peculiarities of interstellar extinction. Hydrogen, by
far the most abundant constituent of interstellar clouds, should alone account
for the three major features of interstellar extinction: the departure of the
continuum from linearity, the bump, and the DIBs.

shallow defects ($\leq$ 4 meV below the conduction band edge) created by an
e-beam exposure by measuring the density of shallow electron traps in two sets
of high-mobility MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). One set was irradiated
with an electron-beam (10 keV, 40 $\mu$C/cm$^2$) and was subsequently annealed
in forming gas while the other set remained unexposed. Low temperature (335 mK)
transport measurements indicate that the forming gas anneal recovers the e-beam
exposed sample's peak mobility (14,000 cm$^2$/Vs) to within a factor of two of
the unexposed sample's mobility (23,000 cm$^2$/Vs). Using electron spin
resonance (ESR) to measure the density of shallow traps, we find that the two
sets of devices are nearly identical, indicating the forming gas anneal is
sufficient to anneal out shallow defects generated by the e-beam exposure.
Fitting the two sets of devices' transport data to a percolation transition
model, we extract a T=0 percolation threshold density in quantitative agreement
with our lowest temperature ESR-measured trap densities.

detected across a thick layer of tissues, among them the skin, the scull and
the brain. In this region, there are many absorbing light chromophores, but
only three are important as far as the oxygenation is concerned. They are the
hemoglobin (HbO2), the deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and cytochrome oxidase (CtOx). The
devices that were used in our experiments were : Somanetics INVOS Brain
Oximeter (IBO) and Toomim's HEG spectrophotometer. The performances of both
devices were compared including their merits and drawbacks. The IBO use for
research has two drawbacks: the sampling rate is too small and the readings are
limited to only two significant digits. The HEG device does not have these
drawbacks, but is not developed sufficiently at this time to measure rSO2. We
have measured the HEG readings and compared them with the rSO2 readings of the
IBO. Results of an experiment are presented whose aim is to explore the
relationship between respiration and cerebral oxygenation. Measurements of end

(rSO2) using the INVOS Cerebral Oximeter of Somanetics. Due to the device
limitations we could explore only subjects who could perform with a breathing

double MS. We demonstrate that these features cannot be due to photometric
errors, field star contamination, or differential reddening. From a comparison
with theoretical models and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a coeval
stellar population featuring a distribution of stellar rotation rates can
reproduce the MS split quite well. However, it cannot reproduce the observed
MSTO region, which is significantly wider than the simulated ones. Exploiting
narrow-band Halpha imaging, we find that the MSTO hosts a population of
Halpha-emitting stars which are interpreted as rapidly rotating Be-type stars.
We explore the possibility that the discrepancy between the observed MSTO
morphology and that of the simulated simple stellar population (SSP) is caused
by the fraction of these objects that are highly reddened, but we rule out this
hypothesis. We demonstrate that the global CMD morphology is well-reproduced by
a combination of SSPs that cover an age range of ~ 35 Myr as well as a wide
variety of rotation rates. We derive the cluster mass and escape velocity and
use dynamical evolution models to predict their evolution starting at an age of
10 Myr. We discuss these results and their implications in the context of the
extended MSTO phenomenon.

constrain the sizes of the accretion disks. We select 240 quasars with
redshifts $z \approx 1$ or $z \approx 0.3$ that are relatively emission line

possible to detect lags on the scale of the light crossing time of the
accretion disks. With the code JAVELIN, we detect typical lags of several days
in the rest frame between the $g$ band and the $riz$ bands. The detected lags
are $\sim 2-3$ times larger than the light crossing time estimated from the
standard thin disk model, consistent with the recently measured lag in NGC5548

increase with increasing luminosity. Furthermore, the increase in lags going
from $g-r$ to $g-i$ and then to $g-z$ is slower than predicted in the thin disk
model, particularly for high luminosity quasars. The radial temperature profile
in the disk must be different from what is assumed. We also find evidence that
the lags decrease with increasing line ratios between ultraviolet FeII lines
and MgII, which may point to changes in the accretion disk structure at higher
metallicity.

minimization of interfacial tension (for example, during phase separation) or
faceted crystal growth, their surfaces tend to have minimum-area spherical or
topologically equivalent shapes such as prisms and irregular grains (all
continuously deformable - homeomorphic - to spheres). Although toroidal DNA
condensates and vesicles with different numbers of handles can exist and soft
matter defects can be shaped as rings and knots, the role of particle topology

particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging
reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total charge of
particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet and
Poincare-Hopf index theorems. This allows us to establish and experimentally
test the procedure for assignment and summation of topological charges in
three-dimensional director fields. Our findings lay the groundwork for new
applications of colloids and liquid crystals that range from topological memory

Therefore, this approach eliminates the need of an analytical description of
the boundary and geometry of objects in DPD simulations and makes it possible
to load the geometry of a system directly from experimental images or

the BVF and prevented by a predictor-corrector algorithm. The no-slip boundary
condition is achieved by employing effective dissipative coefficients for
liquid-solid interactions. Quantitative evaluations of the new method are
performed for the plane Poiseuille flow, the plane Couette flow and the Wannier
flow in a cylindrical domain and compared with their corresponding analytical
solutions and (high-order) spectral element solution of the Navier-Stokes
equations. We verify that the proposed method yields correct no-slip boundary
condition for velocity and generates negligible fluctuations of density and
temperature in the vicinity of the wall surface. Moreover, we construct a very
complex 3D geometry - the ""Brown Pacman"" microfluidic device - to explicitly
demonstrate how to construct a DPD system with complex geometry directly from
loading a graphical image. In addition to stationary arbitrary-shape objects,
the new method is particularly useful for problems involving moving and

consider small aspect ratio by solving the ferrohydrodynamical equations,
carrying out systematic bifurcation analysis. Without magnetic field, we find
steady flow patterns, previously observed with a simple fluid, such as those
containing normal one- or two vortex cells, as well as anomalous one-cell and
twin-cell flow states. However, when a symmetry-breaking transverse magnetic
field is present, all flow states exhibit stimulated, finite two-fold mode.
Various bifurcations between steady and unsteady states can occur,
corresponding to the transitions between the two-cell and one-cell states.
While unsteady, axially oscillating flow states can arise, we also detect the
emergence of new unsteady flow states. In particular, we uncover two new
states: one contains only the azimuthally oscillating solution in the
configuration of the twin-cell flow state, and another a rotating flow state.
Topologically, these flow states are a limit cycle and a quasiperiodic solution
on a two-torus, respectively. Emergence of new flow states in addition to
observed ones with classical fluid, indicates that richer but potentially more
controllable dynamics in ferrofluidic flows, as such flow states depend on the

important clues about the formation and evolution of the Solar System.
Especially intriguing is the epoch 3.8-3.9 Gyr ago (Ga), known as the Late
Heavy Bombardment (LHB), when the youngest lunar basins such as Imbrium and
Orientale formed. The LHB was suggested to originate from a slowly declining
impactor flux or from a late dynamical instability. Here we develop a model for
the historical flux of large asteroid impacts and discuss how it depends on
various parameters, including the time and nature of the planetary
migration/instability. We find that the asteroid impact flux dropped by 1 to 2
orders of magnitude during the first 1 Gyr and remained relatively unchanged
over the last 3 Gyr. The early impacts were produced by asteroids whose orbits
became excited during the planetary migration/instability, and by those
originating from the inner extension of the main belt (E-belt; semimajor axis
1.6<a<2.1 au). The profiles obtained for the early and late versions of the
planetary instability initially differ, but end up being similar after ~3 Ga.
Thus, the time of the instability can only be determined by considering the
cratering and other constraints during the first ~1.5 Gyr of the Solar System
history. Our absolute calibration of the impact flux indicates that asteroids
were probably not responsible for the LHB, independently of whether the
instability happened early or late, because the calibrated flux is not large
enough to explain Imbrium/Orientale and a significant share of large lunar
craters. Comets and leftovers of the terrestrial planet formation provided
additional, and probably dominant source of impacts during early epochs.

$\newcommand{D}{\mc{D}(\mc{Q},L^p,\ell_w^q)}$ We present a framework for the
construction of structured, possibly compactly supported Banach frames and
atomic decompositions for decomposition spaces. Such a space $\D$ is defined
using a frequency covering $\mc{Q}=(Q_i)_{i\in I}$: If $(\varphi_i)_{i}$ is a
suitable partition of unity subordinate to $\mc{Q}$, then $\Vert
g\Vert_{\D}:=\left\Vert\left(\Vert\mc{F}^{-1}(\varphi_i\hat{g})\Vert_{L^p}\right)_{i}\right\Vert_{\ell_w^q}$.
  We assume $\mc{Q}=(T_iQ+b_i)_{i}$, with $T_i\in{\rm
GL}(\Bbb{R}^d),b_i\in\Bbb{R}^d$. Given a prototype $\gamma$, we consider the
system \[\Psi_{c}=(L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]})_{i\in
I,k\in\Bbb{Z}^d}\text{ with }\gamma^{[i]}=|\det T_i|^{1/2}\,
M_{b_i}(\gamma\circ T_i^T),\] with translation $L_x$ and modulation $M_{\xi}$.
We provide verifiable conditions on $\gamma$ under which $\Psi_c$ forms a
Banach frame or an atomic decomposition for $\D$, for small enough sampling
density $c>0$. Our theory allows compactly supported prototypes and applies for
arbitrary $p,q\in(0,\infty]$.
  Often, $\Psi_c$ is both a Banach frame and an atomic decomposition, so that
analysis sparsity is equivalent to synthesis sparsity, i.e. the analysis
coefficients $(\langle f,L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]}\rangle)_{i,k}$ lie in
$\ell^p$ iff $f$ belongs to a certain decomposition space, iff
$f=\sum_{i,k}c_k^{(i)}\cdot L_{c\cdot T_i^{-T}k}\gamma^{[i]}$ with
$(c_k^{(i)})_{i,k}\in\ell^p$. This is convenient if only analysis sparsity is
known to hold: Generally, this only yields synthesis sparsity w.r.t. the dual
frame, about which often only little is known. But our theory yields synthesis
sparsity w.r.t. the well-understood primal frame.
  In particular, our theory applies to $\alpha$-modulation spaces and inhom.
Besov spaces. It also applies to shearlet frames, as we show in a companion
paper.

oceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the
magnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers,
appropriate for astrophysical applications, a modified Rayleigh-B\'enard system
with large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For
large Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines
a prognostic equation for the solute field and a diagnostic equation for
inertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identified
for the second model: The weakly driven regime is characterized by a
large-scale flow associated with a balance between advection and linear
instability, while the strongly driven regime produces multiscale structures,
resulting in a balance between the energy input through linear instability and
the energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict
and numerically confirm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity
fluxes on the ratio between solute and heat Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and
probability density functions are also computed.

survives transition to the most general linear electrodynamics without
birefringence, which rests on a spacetime geometry constituted by a Lorentzian
metric and two scalar fields, a dilaton and an axion. By computing the Poynting
vector and optical scalar transport in the geometrical optics limit of this
framework, we derive the modification of the light flux in the presence of a
dilaton field and present improved constraints on the gradient of the dilaton
field from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum. Although
this flux modification may seem applicable also to fundamental modifications of
the Etherington relation, we show that the distance duality relation still

non-metricities, once astrophysical sources for attenuation, such as dust, are
accounted for. Moreover, using the most up-to-date measurements of the

with bound constrained optimization problems. However, DIRECT suffers from
dimension curse, since its computational complexity soars when dimension
increases. Besides, DIRECT also converges slowly when the objective function is
flat. In this paper, we propose a coordinate DIRECT algorithm, which coincides
with the spirits of other coordinate update algorithms. We transform the
original problem into a series of sub-problems, where only one or several
coordinates are selected to optimize and the rest keeps fixed. For each
sub-problem, coordinately dividing the feasible domain enjoys low computational
burden. Besides, we develop adaptive schemes to keep the efficiency and
flexibility to tackle different functions. Specifically, we use block
coordinate update, of which the size could be adaptively selected, and we also
employ sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to conduct the local search to
efficiently accelerate the convergence even when the objective function is
flat. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm achieves promising
performance on both efficiency and accuracy in numerical experiments.

0.23 \r{ho}i (~ 30 \r{ho}e) in the circular cross-section perpendicular to its

adaptations must occur in small steps because of pleiotropic constraints. When
supplemented with the assumption of additivity of mutational effects on
phenotypic traits, it provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of
genotypic epistasis from the nonlinear mapping of phenotypes to fitness. Of
particular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a
necessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we
compute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign
epistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension
$n$, and varies nonmonotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum.
We then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic
landscapes comprised of all combinations of $L$ random mutations. This number
increases exponentially with $L$, and the corresponding growth rate is used as
a measure of the complexity of the landscape. The dependence of the complexity
on the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct
phases characterized by different landscape structures are identified. Our
analysis shows that the phenotypic dimension, which is often referred to as
phenotypic complexity, does not generally correlate with the complexity of
fitness landscapes and that even organisms with a single phenotypic trait can
have complex landscapes. Our results further inform the interpretation of
experiments where the parameters of Fisher's model have been inferred from
data, and help to elucidate which features of empirical fitness landscapes can
be described by this model.

perceptually coherence atomic regions by assigning every pixel a superpixel
label. Those algorithms have been wildly used as a preprocessing step in
computer vision works, as they can enormously reduce the number of entries of
subsequent algorithms. In this work, we propose an alternative superpixel
segmentation method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by assuming that each
superpixel corresponds to a Gaussian distribution, and assuming that each pixel
is generated by first randomly choosing one distribution from several Gaussian
distributions which are defined to be related to that pixel, and then the pixel
is drawn from the selected distribution. Based on this assumption, each pixel
is supposed to be drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown
parameters (GMM). An algorithm based on expectation-maximization method is
applied to estimate the unknown parameters. Once the unknown parameters are
obtained, the superpixel label of a pixel is determined by a posterior
probability. The success of applying GMM to superpixel segmentation depends on
the two major differences between the traditional GMM-based clustering and the
proposed one: data points in our model may be non-identically distributed, and
we present an approach to control the shape of the estimated Gaussian functions
by adjusting their covariance matrices. Our method is of linear complexity with
respect to the number of pixels. The proposed algorithm is inherently parallel
and can get faster speed by adding simple OpenMP directives to our
implementation. According to our experiments, our algorithm outperforms the

can be characterized by two broad lorentzian functions centered at 0.4 and 3

assemblies with tunable interparticle separations that can be controlled at
will. We demonstrate reconfigurable multiscale interactions and assembly of
colloids mediated by defects in cholesteric liquid crystals that are probed by
means of laser manipulation and three-dimensional imaging. We find that
colloids attract via distance-independent elastic interactions when pinned to
the ends of cholesteric oily streaks, line defects at which one or more layers
are interrupted. However, dislocations and oily streaks can also be optically
manipulated to induce kinks, allowing one to lock them into the desired
configurations that are stabilized by elastic energy barriers for structural
transformation of the particle-connecting defects. Under the influence of
elastic energy landscape due to these defects, sublamellar-sized colloids
self-assemble into structures mimicking the cores of dislocations and oily
streaks. Interactions between these defect embedded colloids can be varied from
attractive to repulsive by optically introducing dislocation kinks. The
reconfigurable nature of defect-particle interactions allows for patterning of
defects by manipulation of colloids and, in turn, patterning of particles by
these defects, thus achieving desired colloidal configurations on scales
ranging from the size of defect core to the sample size. This defect-colloidal
sculpturing may be extended to other lamellar media, providing the means for
optically guided self-assembly of mesoscopic composites with predesigned

Finding parameters with the maximum likelihood is NP-hard even in very simple

developed for models with linear structures: topic models, mixture models,
hidden markov models, etc. These algorithms use matrix or tensor decomposition,
and make some reasonable assumptions about the parameters of the underlying
model.
  But matrix or tensor decomposition seems of little use when the latent
variable model has nonlinearities. The current paper shows how to make
progress: tensor decomposition is applied for learning the single-layer {\em

example in the classic QMR-DT software for diagnosing which disease(s) a
patient may have by observing the symptoms he/she exhibits.
  The technical novelty here, which should be useful in other settings in
future, is analysis of tensor decomposition in presence of systematic error
(i.e., where the noise/error is correlated with the signal, and doesn't
decrease as number of samples goes to infinity). This requires rethinking all
steps of tensor decomposition methods from the ground up.

In this study, we investigated the evolution of favoritism and group fairness

both strategy updating and partner switching dynamics. In the TUG, one proposer
makes an offer to two responders and the proposal is accepted at the group
level if at least one individual responder accepts the offer. Investigating
fairness beyond dyadic relationships allows the possibility of favoritism
because the proposer can secure acceptance at the group level by discriminating
in favor of one responder. Our simulation showed that the proposer favors one
responder with a similar type when the frequency of partner switching is low.
In contrast, group fairness is observed when the frequency of partner switching
is high. The correlation between strategy and neighborhood size suggested that
partner switching influences the strategy through the proposer's offer rather
than through the responder's acceptance threshold. In addition, the average
degree negatively impacts the emergence of fairness unless the frequency of
partner switching is high. Furthermore, a higher frequency of partner switching

Sturm-Liouville equations and for their derivatives is obtained. The
representation possesses an attractive feature for applications: for all real
values of the spectral parameter $\omega$ the difference between the exact
solution and the approximate one (the truncated NSBF) depends on $N$ (the
truncation parameter) and the coefficients of the equation and does not depend
on $\omega$. A similar result is valid when $\omega\in\mathbb{C}$ belongs to a
strip $|Im\omega|<C$. This feature makes the NSBF representation especially
useful for applications requiring computation of solutions for large intervals
of $\omega$. Error and decay rate estimates are obtained. An algorithm for
solving initial value, boundary value or spectral problems for the
Sturm-Liouville equation is developed and illustrated on a test problem.

physical and biological systems. Although the eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}$ and
eigenvectors $\{{\bf u}_i\}$ of a covariance matrix are central to such
endeavors, in practice one must inevitably approximate the covariance matrix
based on data with finite sample size $n$ to obtain empirical eigenvalues
$\{\tilde{\lambda}_i\}$ and eigenvectors $\{\tilde{{\bf u}}_i\}$, and therefore
understanding the error so introduced is of central importance. We analyze
eigenvector error $\|{\bf u}_i - \tilde{{\bf u}}_i \|^2$ while leveraging the
assumption that the true covariance matrix having size $p$ is drawn from a
matrix ensemble with known spectral properties---particularly, we assume the
distribution of population eigenvalues weakly converges as $p\to\infty$ to a
spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ and that the spacing between population
eigenvalues is similar to that for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. Our
approach complements previous analyses of eigenvector error that require the
full set of eigenvalues to be known, which can be computationally infeasible
when $p$ is large. To provide a scalable approach for uncertainty
quantification of eigenvector error, we consider a fixed eigenvalue $\lambda$
and approximate the distribution of the expected square error $r=
\mathbb{E}\left[\| {\bf u}_i - \tilde{{\bf u}}_i \|^2\right]$ across the matrix
ensemble for all ${\bf u}_i$ associated with $\lambda_i=\lambda$. We find, for
example, that for sufficiently large matrix size $p$ and sample size $n>p$, the
probability density of $r$ scales as $1/nr^2$. This power-law scaling implies
that eigenvector error is extremely heterogeneous---even if $r$ is very small
for most eigenvectors, it can be large for others with non-negligible
probability. We support this and further results with numerical experiments.

the boundaries. The most general set of boundary conditions ensuring the
confinement of matter within the boundaries is employed. We find that the
chiral magnetic effect disappears, whereas the chiral separation effect stays
on, becoming dependent on temperature and on a choice of boundary conditions.
As temperature increases from zero to large values, a stepped-shape behaviour
of the chiral separation effect as a function of chemical potential is changed
to a smooth one. A choice of the boundary condition can facilitate either
amplification or diminution of the chiral separation effect; in particular, the
effect can persist even at zero chemical potential, if temperature is finite.
This points at a significant role of boundaries for physical systems with hot
dense magnetized spinor matter, i.e. compact astrophysical objects (neutron

classification, and the MvMM is used to model the joint intensity distribution

segmentation combining the complementary texture information from
multi-sequence (MS) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Furthermore, there
exist inter-image mis-registration and intra-image misalignment of slices in
the MS CMR images. Hence, the MvMM is formulated with transformations, which
are embedded into the LL framework and optimized simultaneously with the
segmentation parameters. The proposed method is able to correct the inter- and
intra-image misalignment by registering each slice of the MS CMR to a virtual
common space, as well as to delineate the indistinguishable boundaries of
myocardium consisting of pathologies. Results have shown statistically
significant improvement in the segmentation performance of the proposed method
with respect to the conventional approaches which can solely segment each image

competition for extracting revenue: when selling a single item to $n$ bidders
whose values are drawn i.i.d. from a regular distribution, the simple
welfare-maximizing VCG mechanism (in this case, a second price-auction) with
one additional bidder extracts at least as much revenue in expectation as the
optimal mechanism. The beauty of this theorem stems from the fact that VCG is a
{\em prior-independent} mechanism, where the seller possesses no information
about the distribution, and yet, by recruiting one additional bidder it
performs better than any prior-dependent mechanism tailored exactly to the
distribution at hand (without the additional bidder).
  In this work, we establish the first {\em full Bulow-Klemperer} results in
{\em multi-dimensional} environments, proving that by recruiting additional
bidders, the revenue of the VCG mechanism surpasses that of the optimal
(possibly randomized, Bayesian incentive compatible) mechanism. For a given
environment with i.i.d. bidders, we term the number of additional bidders
needed to achieve this guarantee the environment's {\em competition
complexity}.
  Using the recent duality-based framework of Cai et al. [2016] for reasoning
about optimal revenue, we show that the competition complexity of $n$ bidders
with additive valuations over $m$ independent, regular items is at most
$n+2m-2$ and at least $\log(m)$. We extend our results to bidders with additive
valuations subject to downward-closed constraints, showing that these
significantly more general valuations increase the competition complexity by at
most an additive $m-1$ factor. We further improve this bound for the special
case of matroid constraints, and provide additional extensions as well.

unique partition of the vertex set of a bipartite graph reflecting the
structure of all the maximum matchings therein. A bipartite graph is said to be
DM-irreducible if its DM-decomposition consists of a single component.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of making a given bipartite graph
DM-irreducible by adding edges. When the input bipartite graph is balanced
(i.e., both sides have the same number of vertices) and has a perfect matching,
this problem is equivalent to making a directed graph strongly connected by
adding edges, for which the minimum number of additional edges was
characterized by Eswaran and Tarjan (1976).
  We give a general solution to this problem, which is divided into three
parts. We first show that our problem can be formulated as a special case of a
general framework of covering supermodular functions, which was introduced by
Frank and Jord\'an (1995) to investigate the directed connectivity augmentation
problem. Secondly, when the input graph is not balanced, the problem is solved
via matroid intersection. This result can be extended to the minimum cost
version in which the addition of an edge gives rise to an individual cost.
Thirdly, for balanced input graphs, we devise a combinatorial algorithm that
finds a minimum number of additional edges to attain the DM-irreducibility,
while the minimum cost version of this problem is NP-hard. These results also
lead to min-max characterizations of the minimum number, which generalize the
result of Eswaran and Tarjan.

of the thermoelectric properties generally, we first adopt models with band
structures having the dispersion $E({\bf k}) \sim |{\bf k}|^n$ with $n = 2, 4$
and 6. We consider one, two- and three dimensional systems, and calculate the
thermoelectric properties using the Boltzmann equation approach within the
constant quasi-particle lifetime approximation. $n = 2$ corresponds to the
usual parabolic band structure, while the band shape for $n = 4, 6$ has a flat
portion at the band edge, so that the density of states diverges at the bottom
of the band. We call this kind of band structure the ""pudding mold type band"".
$n \ge 4$ belong to the pudding mold type band, but since the density of states
diverges even for $n= 2$ in one dimensional system, this is also categorized as
the pudding mold type. Due to the large density of states and the rapid change
of the group velocity around the band edge, the spectral conductivity of the
pudding mold type band structures becomes larger than that of the usual
parabolic band structures. It is found that the pudding mold type band has a
coexistence of large Seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity, and
small Lorenz number in the Wiedemann--Franz law due to the specific band shape.
We also find that the low dimensionality of the band structure can contribute
to large electronic conductivity and hence a small Lorenz number. We conclude
that the pudding mold type band, especially in low dimensional systems, can
enhance not only the power factor but also the dimensionless figure of merit
due to stronger violation of the Wiedemann--Franz law.

that correspond to the same real-world entity across several data sources held
by different parties without revealing any sensitive information about these
records, is increasingly being required in many real-world application areas.
Examples range from public health surveillance to crime and fraud detection,
and national security. Various techniques have been developed to tackle the
problem of PPRL, with the majority of them considering linking data from only
two sources. However, in many real-world applications data from more than two
sources need to be linked. In this paper we propose a viable solution for
multi-party PPRL using two efficient privacy techniques: Bloom filter encoding
and distributed secure summation. Our proposed protocol efficiently identifies
matching sets of records held by all data sources that have a similarity above
a certain minimum threshold. While being efficient, our protocol is also secure
under the semi-honest adversary model in that no party can learn any sensitive
information about any other parties' data, but all parties learn which of their
records have a high similarity with records held by the other parties. We
evaluate our protocol on a large real voter registration database showing the
scalability, linkage quality, and privacy of our approach.

holds, where $\rho_{x(y)}$ is the resistivity along the longer (shorter) Fe-Fe
axis. In contrast, the opposite anisotropy $\rho_x<\rho_y$ is realized in other
undoped Fe-based superconductors. Such nontrivial material dependence is
naturally explained in terms of the strongly orbital-dependent inelastic
quasiparticle scattering realized in the orbital-ordered state. The opposite
anisotropy between FeSe ($\rho_x>\rho_y$) and other undoped compounds
($\rho_x<\rho_y$) reflects the difference in the number of hole-pockets. We
also explain the large in-plane anisotropy of the thermoelectric power in the

effectively suppressed owing to its gradually increased mode area as well as
continuously changed Brillouin frequency shift dependent on the core diameter.
As a result, an output power of 260 W without SBS and mode instability (MI) is
obtained, with a slope efficiency of 71.3 % and a narrow linewidth of ~2GHz.
However, the MI rather than SBS is observed when output power reaches 260 W.
The features of MI are experimentally studied in detail. It is pointed out
that, the MI seems the primary and durative limitation factor of the tapered
fiber amplifier for high-power narrow-linewidth output, although it has
advantage to reduce other nonlinear effect. To the best of our knowledge, this

network into three different functional components (body, neck and head). We
further propose a weight-shared residual neck module as well as a
scale-tolerant attentional head module for efficient one-shot inference. On MS
COCO benchmark, the proposed FastMask outperforms all state-of-the-art segment
proposal methods in average recall being 2~5 times faster. Moreover, with a
slight trade-off in accuracy, FastMask can segment objects in near real time
(~13 fps) with 800*600 resolution images, demonstrating its potential in
practical applications. Our implementation is available on

protocol is proposed using a modified scheme for multi-party circular quantum
key agreement. In the proposed protocol, the set of all ($n$) bidders is
grouped in to $l$ subsets (sub-circles) in such a way that only the initiator
(who prepares the quantum state to be distributed for a particular round of
communication and acts as the receiver in that round) is a member of all the
subsets (sub-circles) prepared for a particular round, while any other bidder
is part of only a single subset. All $n$ bidders and auctioneer initiate one
round of communication, and each of them prepares $l$ copies of a
$\left(r-1\right)$-partite entangled state (one for each sub-circle), where
$r=\frac{n}{l}+1$. The efficiency and security\textcolor{blue}{{} }of the
proposed protocol are critically analyzed. It is shown that the proposed
protocol is free from the collusion attacks that are possible on the existing
schemes of quantum sealed-bid auction. Further, it is observed that the
security against collusion attack increases with the increase in $l$, but that
reduces the complexity (number of entangled qubits in each entangled state) of
the entangled states to be used and that makes the scheme scalable and
implementable with the available technologies. The additional security and
scalability is shown to arise due to the use of a circular structure in place
of a complete-graph or tree-type structure used earlier.

  Paper I presents the detection of the ellipsoidal and the beaming effects in
the CoRoT light curve of CoRoT-3, a system of a $22$$M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarf
orbiting an F star with an orbital period of $4.3$ days. This work served as a
proof-of-concept that these effects are detectable in the space light curves of
systems with brown-dwarf or planetary secondaries, thus indicating that similar
modulations may be detected in the light curves of non-transiting systems.
  Abridged...
  The last study, Paper VII, demonstrates the different strengths and utility
of the BEER search algorithm. It presents the discovery of four short-period
eclipsing binaries in the Kepler light curves, consisting of an A-star primary
and a low-mass WD secondary (dA+WD). The systems show BEER phase modulations
together with primary and secondary eclipses. These add to the 6 Kepler, and 18
WASP, previously known short-period eclipsing dA+WD binaries. The paper shows
that three of the new systems harbor the smallest WDs detected so far in such
binaries. These three binaries extend the previously known population to older
systems with cooler and smaller WD secondaries, allowing to test binary
evolution theories in a parameter region not observed before.
  The seven papers illustrate the effectiveness of the BEER algorithm in
finding both common stellar binaries and rare astrophysical objects. As such,
the BEER tool can serve as an important component in the virtual astronomy
toolbox for mining the vast astronomical data produced by current and future
photometric surveys. Abridged.

curvature measures of convex bodies. On convex polytopes, there exist further
generalizations some of which also have continuous extensions to arbitrary

(generalized) tensorial curvature measures. As a consequence of these results,
we now derive a complete system of Crofton formulae for such (generalized)
tensorial curvature measures. These formulae express the integral mean of the
(generalized) tensorial curvature measures of the intersection of a given
convex body (resp. polytope, or finite unions thereof) with a uniform affine
$k$-flat in terms of linear combinations of (generalized) tensorial curvature
measures of the given convex body (resp. polytope, or finite unions thereof).
The considered generalized tensorial curvature measures generalize those
studied formerly in the context of Crofton-type formulae, and the coefficients
involved in these results are substantially less technical and structurally
more transparent than in previous works. Finally, we prove that essentially all
generalized tensorial curvature measures on convex polytopes are linearly
independent. In particular, this implies that the Crofton formulae which we
prove in this contribution cannot be simplified further.

different mathematical models and approaches to investigate the dynamics of
small particles orbiting around the Earth. Such models and methods strongly
depend on the altitude of the objects above Earth's surface, since the strength
of the different forces acting on an Earth orbiting object (geopotential,
atmospheric drag, lunar and solar attractions, solar radiation pressure, etc.)
varies with the altitude of the debris.
  In this review, our focus is on presenting different analytical and numerical
approaches employed in modern studies of the space debris problem. We start by
considering a model including the geopotential, solar and lunar gravitational
forces and the solar radiation pressure. We summarize the equations of motion
using different formalisms: Cartesian coordinates, Hamiltonian formulation
using Delaunay and epicyclic variables, Milankovitch elements. Some of these
methods lead in a straightforward way to the analysis of resonant motions. In
particular, we review results found recently about the dynamics near tesseral,
secular and semi-secular resonances.
  As an application of the above methods, we proceed to analyze a timely
subject namely the possible causes for the onset of chaos in space debris
dynamics. Precisely, we discuss the phenomenon of overlapping of resonances,
the effect of a large area-to-mass ratio, the influence of lunisolar secular
resonances.
  We conclude with a short discussion about the effect of the dissipation due
to the atmospheric drag and we provide a list of minor effects, which could
influence the dynamics of space debris.

small cell networks with underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communication is
investigated. The proposed approach exploits social strategic relationships
between user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity to optimize the
overall network performance. This problem is formulated as a matching game
between UEs and their serving nodes (SNs) in which, an SN can be a small cell
base station (SCBS) or an important UE with D2D capabilities. The problem is
cast as a many-to-one matching game in which UEs and SNs rank one another using
preference relations that capture both the wireless aspects (i.e., received
signal strength, traffic load, etc.) and users' social ties (e.g., UE proximity
and social distance). Due to the combinatorial nature of the network-wide UE-SN
matching, the problem is decomposed into a dynamic clustering problem in which
SCBSs are grouped into disjoint clusters based on mutual interference.
Subsequently, an UE-SN matching game is carried out per cluster. The game under
consideration is shown to belong to a class of matching games with
externalities arising from interference and peer effects due to users social
distance, enabling UEs and SNs to interact with one another until reaching a
stable matching. Simulation results show that the proposed social-aware user
association approach yields significant performance gains, reaching up to 26%,
24%, and 31% for 5-th, 50-th and 95-th percentiles for UE throughputs,
respectively, as compared to the classical social-unaware baseline.

colour-coded plots to demonstrate how the value of the semi-major axis of the
bar influences the regular or chaotic dynamics of the 3-dof system. For
distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion we use the Smaller ALingment
Index (SALI) method, a fast yet very accurate tool. Undoubtedly, the most
important elements of the dynamics are the normally hyperbolic invariant
manifolds (NHIMs) located in the vicinity of the index 1 Lagrange points $L_2$
and $L_3$. These manifolds direct the flow of stars over the saddle points,
while they also trigger the formation of rings and spirals. The dynamics in the
neighbourhood of the saddle points is visualized by bifurcation diagrams of the
Lyapunov orbits as well as by the restriction of the Poincar\'e map to the
NHIMs. In addition, we reveal how the semi-major axis of the bar influences the
structure of these manifolds which determine the final stellar structure (rings
or spirals). Our numerical simulations suggest that in galaxies with weak bars
the formation of $R_1$ rings or $R_1'$ pseudo-rings is favoured. In the case of
galaxies with intermediate and strong bars the invariant manifolds seem to give
rise to $R_1R_2$ rings and twin spiral formations, respectively. We also
compare our numerical outcomes with earlier related work and with observational

relativistic and evolve in the well known linear scaling regime. In this work
we show that a sufficiently large Hubble damping (that is a sufficiently fast
expansion rate) leads to a linear scaling regime where the network is
non-relativistic. This is therefore another realization of a Kibble scaling
regime, and also has a conformal stretching regime counterpart which we

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the two and three
dimensional compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on staggered
unstructured curved meshes. The method is pressure-based and semi-implicit and
is able to deal with all Mach number flows. In our scheme, the discrete
pressure is defined on the primal grid, while the discrete velocity field and
the density are defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. All convective
terms are discretized explicitly, while the pressure terms appearing in the
momentum and energy equation are discretized implicitly. Substitution of the
momentum equation into the energy equation yields a linear system for the
scalar pressure as the only unknown. The enthalpy and the kinetic energy are
taken explicitly and are then updated using a simple Picard procedure. Thanks
to the use of a staggered grid, the final pressure system is a very sparse
block five-point system for three dimensional problems. The viscous terms and
the heat flux are also discretized making use of the staggered grid by defining
the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector on the dual grid, which
corresponds to the use of a lifting operator on the dual grid. The time step of
our new numerical method is limited by a CFL condition based only on the fluid
velocity and not on the sound speed. This makes the method particularly
interesting for low Mach number flows. Finally, a very simple combination of
artificial viscosity and the a posteriori MOOD technique allows to deal with
shock waves and thus permits also to simulate high Mach number flows. We show
computational results for a large set of two and three-dimensional benchmark
problems, including both low and high Mach number flows and using polynomial
approximation degrees up to p=4.

This problem has been previously considered by means of analytical

of a classifier trained with features provided by rich image models. As both
features extraction and classification steps are perfectly embodied in the deep
learning architecture called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), different
studies have tried to design a CNN-based steganalyzer. The network designed by
Xu et al. is the first competitive CNN with the combination Spatial Rich Models
(SRM) and Ensemble Classifier (EC) providing detection performances of the same
order. In this work we propose a criterion to choose either the CNN or the
SRM+EC method for a given input image. Our approach is studied with three
different steganographic spatial domain algorithms: S-UNIWARD, MiPOD, and HILL,
using the Tensorflow computing platform, and exhibits detection capabilities
better than each method alone. Furthermore, as SRM+EC and the CNN are both only
trained with a single embedding algorithm, namely MiPOD, the proposed method
can be seen as an approach for blind steganalysis. In blind detection, error
rates are respectively of 16% for S-UNIWARD, 16% for MiPOD, and 17% for HILL on
the BOSSBase with a payload of 0.4 bpp. For 0.1 bpp, the respective
corresponding error rates are of 39%, 38%, and 41%, and are always better than
the ones provided by SRM+EC.

two macroscopically distinguishable states (a cat being dead or alive), the
system is always predetermined to be in one or other of the two states (prior
to measurement). Proposals to test MR generally introduce a second premise to
further qualify the meaning of MR. This paper examines two such models, the
first where the second premise is that the macroscopically distinguishable
states are quantum states (MQS) and the second where the macroscopcially
distinguishable states are localised hidden variable states (LMHVS). We point
out that in each case in order to negate the model, it is necessary to assume
that the predetermined states give microscopic detail for predictions of
measurements. Thus, it is argued that many cat-signatures do not negate MR but
could be explained by microscopic effects such as a photon-pair nonlocality.
Finally, we consider a third model, macroscopic local realism (MLR), where the
second premise is that measurements at one location cannot cause an
instantaneous macroscopic change to the system at another. By considering
amplification of the quantum noise level via a measurement process, we discuss
how negation of MLR may be possible.

defined as the games at which one player, the leader, commits to a (possibly
mixed) strategy and the other player, the follower, chooses his strategy after
having observed the irrevocable commitment of the leader. Based on a result by
von Stengel and Zamir [2010], the notions of commitment value and commitment
optimal strategies for each player are discussed as a possible solution
concept. It is shown that in non-degenerate bimatrix games (a) pure commitment
optimal strategies together with the follower's best response constitute Nash
equilibria, and (b) strategies that participate in a completely mixed Nash
equilibrium are strictly worse than commitment optimal strategies, provided
they are not matrix game optimal. For various classes of bimatrix games that
generalize zero sum games, the relationship between the maximin value of the
leader's payoff matrix, the Nash equilibrium payoff and the commitment optimal
value is discussed. For the Traveler's Dilemma, the commitment optimal strategy
and commitment value for the leader are evaluated and seem more acceptable as a
solution than the unique Nash equilibrium. Finally, the relationship between
commitment optimal strategies and Nash equilibria in $2 \times 2$ bimatrix
games is thoroughly examined and in addition, necessary and sufficient
conditions for the follower to be worse off at the equilibrium of the
leadership game than at any Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous move game are
provided.

Lomb-Scargle power spectrum method analysis of the real and the simulated data

incompatible period, amplitude and minimum epoch estimates telling nothing
about the real periods, the real amplitudes and the real minimum epochs of the

universally due to the interlayer hopping. We theoretically investigate the
effect of trigonal warping upon distinctive topological phases, like the

Taking Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene as an example, we find that the trigonal
warping plays a crucial role in the formation of QAHE in large exchange field
and/or interlayer potential difference by inducing extra band inversion points
at momentum further away from high symmetric point. The presence of trigonal
warping shrinks the phase space of QAHE and QVHE, leading to the emergence of
valley-polarized QAHE with high Chern numbers ranging from $ \mathcal{C}=-7 $
to $ 7 $. These results suggest that the universal trigonal warping may play
important role when the Bloch states at momentum away from high-symmetric
points are involved.

At room temperature the mobility along the zigzag direction exceeds 20

solids is so rich and versatile that sometimes they seem to be the
inexhaustible subject of fundamental research. In particular, since the
discovery by Lord Rayleigh surface waves in solids focus increased attention of
scientists, because their experimental and theoretical studies can serve as the
source of unique information about the surface impact on the dynamics and
structure of the atomic lattice, structural instabilities and phase transitions
induced by the surface, and explore the properties of phonons in
spatially-confined systems The existence of purely shear surface wave is
impossible in non-piezoelectrics within the framework of the classical theory
of elasticity, because the Rayleigh surface waves have different polarization
and are the mixture of shear and dilatational waves. We showed that the
""forbidden"" shear surface wave (shortly Flexo-SW) can propagate near the
surface of all crystalline dielectrics due to the omnipresent flexoelectric
coupling. The appearance and penetration depth of the Flexo-SW is ruled by the
flexocoupling strength. In particular the penetration depth of transverse
acoustic mode diverges in the absence of the flexoelectric coupling and so
these waves become indistinguishable from the bulk waves. For paraelectrics
such as strontium titanate with typical flexoeletric coefficients (~2V) the
penetration depth of the Flexo-SW can reach more than tens microns at THz
frequencies. The circumstances can explain the absence of experimental
observations of the missed surface waves in thick layers and bulk materials.
However we predict that the peaks of neutron intensity corresponding to the
surface Flexo-SW and bulk phonon modes can be separated in non-piezoelectric
thin films of thickness ~(20 - 50)nm.

graphene field effect transistor driven by an ac gate potential. The non-linear
response to the ac signal is computed through Floquet theory for scattering
states and Landauer-B\""uttiker theory for charge current and its fluctuations.
Photon-assisted excitation of a quasibound state in the top-gate barrier leads
to resonances in transmission that strongly influence the noise properties. For
strong doping of graphene under source and drain contacts, when electrons are
transmitted through the channel via evanescent waves, the resonance leads to a
substantial suppression of noise. The Fano factor is then reduced well below
the pseudo-diffusive value, $F<1/3$, also for strong ac drive. The good
signal-to-noise ratio (small Fano factor) on resonance suggests that the device
is a good candidate for high-frequency (THz) radiation detection. We show
analytically that Klein tunneling (total suppression of back-reflection)
persists for perpendicular incidence also when the barrier is driven
harmonically. Although the transmission is inelastic and distributed among
sideband energies, a sum rule leads to total suppression of shot noise.

but the ontogenetic and cultural dynamics of discourse structure remain to be
quantitatively characterized. To this end we investigated word graphs obtained
from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning
~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and
long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a
monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed
a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest
a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and
lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and
long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation
was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random
structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were
remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size
increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from
above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to
childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the
healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period
of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically,
discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from
randomness.
