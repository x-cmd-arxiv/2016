with both attractive and repulsive forces. More precisely, we show that there
is a universal set of constant-size objects that, when added to any unknown
hole-free polyomino shape, produces an unbounded number of copies of that shape
(plus constant-size garbage objects). The constant-size objects can be easily
constructed from a constant number of individual tile types using a constant
number of preprocessing self-assembly steps. Our construction uses the
well-studied 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) of tile self-assembly, in the
simple model where glues interact only with identical glues, allowing glue
strengths that are either positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive), and
constant temperature (required glue strength for parts to hold together). We
also require that the given shape has specified glue types on its surface, and
that the feature size (smallest distance between nonincident edges) is bounded
below by a constant. Shape replication necessarily requires a self-assembly
model where parts can both attach and detach, and this construction is the
first to do so using the natural model of negative/repulsive glues (also
studied before for other problems such as fuel-efficient computation); previous
replication constructions require more powerful global operations such as an
""enzyme"" that destroys a subset of the tile types.

For instance, in studies on regression discontinuity designs, discontinuity in

assumption. In this paper we develop estimation and testing procedures on
discontinuity in densities with positive support. Our approach is built on
splitting the gamma kernel (Chen, 2000) into two parts at a given
(dis)continuity point and constructing two truncated kernels. The jump-size
magnitude of the density at the point can be estimated nonparametrically by two
kernels and a multiplicative bias correction method. The estimator is easy to
implement, and its convergence properties are delivered by various
approximation techniques on incomplete gamma functions. Based on the jump-size
estimator, two versions of test statistics for the null of continuity at a
given point are also proposed. Moreover, estimation theory of the entire
density in the presence of a discontinuity point is explored. Monte Carlo
simulations confirm nice finite-sample properties of the jump-size estimator

spatial and temporal data from two independent DCNNs are fused either via early
fusion (combination of the fully-connected layers) and late fusion
(concatenation of the softmax outputs of the DCNNs). For bilinear DCNNs,

combined via local co-occurrences. We then fuse the bilinear DCNN and early
fusion of the two-stream approach to combine the spatial and temporal
information at the local and global level (Spatio-Temporal Co-occurrence).
Using the new and challenging video dataset of birds, classification
performance is improved from 23.1% (using single images) to 41.1% when using

determining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent
terrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear
saturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming
a Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density
extrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the
potential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the
FFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,
nucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy
along with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer
density dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the
ability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly
sensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the
ability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential
symmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian
analysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the
resulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential
symmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density
dependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can
describe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density
dependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive
to the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not
enough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the
NS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not
sensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy.

common feature of the stably stratified turbulence (due to the strong helical
waves presence). These waves mostly dominate spectral properties of the
vertical component of velocity field, while the horizontal component is
dominated by the diffusive processes both for the weak and strong stable
stratification ($\beta =2/3$). For the last case influence of the low boundary
can overcome the wave effects and result in $\beta =1/2$ for the vertical
component of the velocity field (the spontaneous breaking of the space
translational symmetry - homogeneity). For the unstably stratified turbulence
in the Rayleigh-Taylor mixing zone the diffusive processes ($\beta =2/3$) are
the most common dominating processes in the anisotropic chaotic mixing of the
two fluids under buoyancy forces. The distributed chaos in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
turbulent convection in an upright cell is determined by the strong confinement
conditions. That is: the spontaneous breaking of the space translational
symmetry (homogeneity) by the finite boundaries ($\beta = 1/2$) or by the
non-perfect orientation of the cell along the buoyancy direction ($\beta

theory and observation. Historically, the problem of CC has been shelved in the
RS point of view, having few or non literature on the subject. In this sense
and as done with the hierarchy problem, we apply the RS model to solve this
difference via extra dimensions; we also describe how brane effects could be
the solution to this substantial difference. It should be noticed that this
problem is studied assuming first Minkoswki type branes, and then followed by
cosmologically more realistic FLRW type branes. We finally find some remarkably
interesting consequences in the RS scenario: The CC problem can be solved via
compactification of the extra dimension and the compactification radius turns
out to be approximately twice the one used to solve the hierarchy problem in
the $\beta\pi r$ factor by Randall and Sundrum, suggesting that this subtle
difference in both problems could be caused by corrections that comes from
quantum gravity effects. We also estimate the corresponding scale where,
according to this results, we should begin to notice subtle deviations to the
inverse square law of gravitation due to the presence of the extra dimension.

this group in terms of the abelianization of normalizers and centralizers in G,

From the theoretical perspective, we establish results in expectation and in

These results show that for an optimal choice of sampling measure $d\mu$ and
weight $w$, which depends on the space $V_m$ and on the measure $d\rho$,
stability and optimal accuracy are achieved under the mild condition that $n$
scales linearly with $m$ up to an additional logarithmic factor. The present
analysis covers also cases where the function $u$ and its approximants from

$X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and $d\rho$ is the Gaussian measure. From the numerical
perspective, we propose a sampling method which allows one to generate
independent and identically distributed samples from the optimal measure
$d\mu$. This method becomes of interest in the multivariate setting where
$d\mu$ is generally not of tensor product type. We illustrate this for

  Aims. We study the topology of the penumbral magnetic field in the lower
photosphere, focusing on regions where it returns below the surface.
  Methods. We analyzed 71 spectropolarimetric datasets from Hinode and from the
GREGOR infrared spectrograph. We inferred the quality and polarimetric accuracy
of the infrared data after applying several reduction steps. Techniques of
spectral inversion and forward synthesis were used to test the detection
algorithm. We compared the morphology and the fractional penumbral area covered

profiles in visible and infrared data of sunspots at various heliocentric

were interpreted in the context of existing penumbral models.
  Results. Observations in visible and near-infrared spectral lines yield a
significant difference in the penumbral area covered by magnetic fields of
opposite polarity. In the infrared, the number of reversed-polarity Stokes V
profiles is smaller by a factor of two than in the visible. For three-lobed
Stokes V profiles the numbers differ by up to an order of magnitude.

its first or second derivatives as well as of linear suppression effects or
more general transitions between modified and Einstein gravity limits. Each
screening or suppression mechanism is parametrised by a time, mass, and
environment dependent screening scale, an effective modified gravitational
coupling in the fully unscreened limit that can be matched to linear theory,
the exponent of a power-law radial profile of the screened coupling, determined
by derivatives, symmetries, and potentials in the scalar field equation, and an
interpolation rate between the screened and unscreened limits. Along with
generalised perturbative methods, the parametrisation may be used to formulate
a nonlinear extension to the linear parametrised post-Friedmannian framework to
enable generalised tests of gravity with the wealth of observations from the

hadron-hadron interaction is the transverse momentum cutoff $p_{T0}$ for
parton-parton interactions which slowly grows with energy and regularizes the
cross section. This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes
beyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can
be extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In
this work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$
and a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a
limit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum
disbalance spectrum. Minijet cross section and its suppression is then analyzed
in two ways. First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and
demonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the
inclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to
the increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard
inclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets
produce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from
differential cross section in the ratio $\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the
average dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\tau>1$ region is sensitive to
the cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models. The energy dependence of the
cutoff is reflected in the energy dependence of the bimodality coefficient $b$
of the $\tau$ distribution. We compare $b$ calculated from $\mathsf{pythia}$,
where one can conveniently control MPIs by the program parameters, and HEF for
a few unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDs). We find that the energy
dependence of $b$ is very sensitive to the particular choice of UGD and in some
models it resembles predictions of the Monte Carlo models.

electroweak/flavor/CP constraints and the absence of non-standard physics at
LHC Run 1 suggest that a ""little hierarchy problem"" remains, and that the new
physics underlying naturalness may lie out of LHC reach. Assuming this to be
the case, we show that there is a simple and natural extension of the minimal
warped model in the Randall-Sundrum framework, in which matter, gauge and
gravitational fields propagate modestly different degrees into the IR of the
warped dimension, resulting in rich and striking consequences for the LHC (and
beyond). The LHC-accessible part of the new physics is AdS/CFT dual to the
mechanism of ""vectorlike confinement"", with TeV-scale Kaluza-Klein excitations
of the gauge and gravitational fields dual to spin-0,1,2 composites. Unlike the
minimal warped model, these low-lying excitations have predominantly
flavor-blind and flavor/CP-safe interactions with the standard model.
Remarkably, this scenario also predicts small deviations from flavor-blindness
originating from virtual effects of Higgs/top compositeness at $\sim O(10)$
TeV, with subdominant resonance decays into Higgs/top-rich final states, giving
the LHC an early ""preview"" of the nature of the resolution of the hierarchy
problem. Discoveries of this type at LHC Run 2 would thereby anticipate (and
set a target for) even more explicit explorations of Higgs compositeness at a

pair of permutations $\pi$ and $\tau$, represented as sequences of integers,
and the task is to determine whether $\tau$ contains a subsequence
order-isomorphic to $\pi$. Bose, Buss and Lubiw proved that PPM is NP-complete
on general inputs.
  We show that PPM is NP-complete even when $\pi$ has no decreasing subsequence
of length 3 and $\tau$ has no decreasing subsequence of length 4. This provides
the first known example of PPM being hard when one or both of $\pi$ and
$\sigma$ are restricted to a proper hereditary class of permutations.
  This hardness result is tight in the sense that PPM is known to be polynomial
when both $\pi$ and $\tau$ avoid a decreasing subsequence of length 3, as well
as when $\pi$ avoids a decreasing subsequence of length 2. The result is also
tight in another sense: we will show that for any hereditary proper subclass C
of the class of permutations avoiding a decreasing sequence of length 3, there
is a polynomial algorithm solving PPM instances where $\pi$ is from C and
$\tau$ is arbitrary.
  We also obtain analogous hardness and tractability results for the class of
so-called skew-merged patterns.
  From these results, we deduce a complexity dichotomy for the PPM problem
restricted to $\pi$ belonging to $Av(\rho)$, where $Av(\rho)$ denotes the class
of permutations avoiding a permutation $\rho$. Specifically, we show that the
problem is polynomial when $\rho$ is in the set {1, 12, 21, 132, 213, 231,

  Problems from Epistemological Solutions in QM)","Welcome!",,,,"quant-ph physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In this paper we discuss the so called ""quantum omelette"" created by Bohr and
Heisenberg through the mix of (ontic) objective accounts and (epistemic)
subjective ones within the analysis of Quantum Mechanics (QM). We will begin by
addressing the difficult relation between ontology and epistemology within the
history of both physics and philosophy. We will then argue that the present
""quantum omelette"" is being presently cooked in two opposite directions: the
first scrambling ontological problems with epistemological solutions and the
second scrambling epistemic approaches with ontological questions. A good
example of the former is a new type of argumentation strategy attempting to
justify the use of decoherence, namely, the ""For All Practical Purposes""
(shortly known as FAPP) type of justification. We will argue that 'FAPP-type
solutions' remain, at best, epistemological answers which not only escape the
ontological questions at stake -regarding the quantum to classical limit- but
also turn the original problem completely meaningless. The latter omelette can
be witnessed in relation to some criticisms raised against the epistemic
Bayesian approach to QM (shortly known as QBism). We will argue that QBists
have produced a consistent scheme that might allow us to begin to unscramble
-at least part of- the ""quantum omelette"". In this respect, we will show why
the epistemic QBist approach is safe from several (ontological) criticisms it
has recently received (see [42, 47, 48]). We end our paper with a discussion
about the importance of ontological approaches within foundations of QM.

present a series of observations, five epochs over a year, taken with Keck and
the VLT, which for the first time show variability of circumstellar absorption
in the gas disk surrounding WD 1145+017 on timescales of minutes to months.
Circumstellar absorption is measured in more than 250 lines of 14 ions among
ten different elements associated with planetary composition, e.g., O, Mg, Ca,
Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni. Broad circumstellar gas absorption with a velocity spread
of 225 km/s is detected, but over the course of a year blue shifted absorption
disappears while redshifted absorption systematically increases. A correlation
of equivalent width and oscillator strength indicates that the gas is not
highly optically thick (median tau approximately 2). We discuss simple models
of an eccentric disk coupled with magnetospheric accretion to explain the basic
observed characteristics of these high resolution and high signal-to-noise
observations. Variability is detected on timescales of minutes in the two most
recent observations, showing a loss of redshifted absorption for tens of
minutes, coincident with major transit events and consistent with gas hidden
behind opaque transiting material. This system currently presents a unique
opportunity to learn how the gas causing the spectroscopic, circumstellar
absorption is associated with the ongoing accretion evidenced by photospheric
contamination, as well as the transiting planetary material detected in
photometric observations.

multivariate $t$-distribution as a special case. The consistency result holds
as long as the data have bounded first moment (an assumption which essentially
holds for datasets commonly encountered in practice). Furthermore, we establish
the asymptotic normality of GMM. Compared to the ""cosine"" similarity which is
routinely adopted in current practice in statistics and machine learning, the
consistency of GMM requires much weaker conditions. Interestingly, when the
data follow the $t$-distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom, GMM typically
provides a better measure of similarity than ""cosine"" roughly when $\nu<8$
(which is already very close to normal). These theoretical results will help
explain the recent success of GMM in learning tasks.

consistently propagate the uncertainties on foreground parameters such as

be uniquely described by their asymptotic characteristics. In fact, in a
certain domain of parameters, there exist different spherically-symmetric,

quantum physics and random matrix theory and have recently found numerous
applications in computer science. DPPs define distributions over subsets of a
given ground set, they exhibit interesting properties such as negative
correlation, and, unlike other models, have efficient algorithms for sampling.
When applied to kernel methods in machine learning, DPPs favor subsets of the
given data with more diverse features. However, many real-world applications
require efficient algorithms to sample from DPPs with additional constraints on
the subset, e.g., partition or matroid constraints that are important to ensure
priors, resource or fairness constraints on the sampled subset. Whether one can
efficiently sample from DPPs in such constrained settings is an important
problem that was first raised in a survey of DPPs by \cite{KuleszaTaskar12} and
studied in some recent works in the machine learning literature.
  The main contribution of our paper is the first resolution of the complexity
of sampling from DPPs with constraints. We give exact efficient algorithms for
sampling from constrained DPPs when their description is in unary. Furthermore,
we prove that when the constraints are specified in binary, this problem is
#P-hard via a reduction from the problem of computing mixed discriminants
implying that it may be unlikely that there is an FPRAS. Our results benefit
from viewing the constrained sampling problem via the lens of polynomials.
Consequently, we obtain a few algorithms of independent interest: 1) to count
over the base polytope of regular matroids when there are additional (succinct)
budget constraints and, 2) to evaluate and compute the mixed characteristic
polynomials, that played a central role in the resolution of the Kadison-Singer
problem, for certain special cases.

high-precision RVs measured between 2011 and 2016, we find no indication of

The results constrain the unsigned parallax error due to orbital motion to $< 2

known binary YZ Carinae and show that the astrometric model must take into
account orbital motion to avoid significant error ($\sim \pm 100 \mu$arcsec).

pulsation-averaged velocity $v_\gamma$ via a template fitting approach using
both new and literature RVs. We discover the spectroscopic binarity of XZ Car

one, even in the absence of knowledge of the speed and statistics of the
radiation source. Second, we tackle a more realistic approximation of

that no more than six sensors are required in the noise free case to track one
piece of the parabola with probability one. Next we present an upper bound on

numerical simulations of protoplanetary disk accretion processes in which the
magnitude of alpha, and thus the steady-state gas surface density, depends on
the orientation of large scale magnetic fields with respect to the disk's
rotation axis. Solving for the metallicity as a function of radius, we find
that for fields anti-aligned with the rotation axis, the inner regions of our
model disk often falls within a region of parameter space not suitable for
planetesimal formation, whereas in the aligned case, the inner disk regions are
likely to produce planetesimals through some combination of streaming
instability and gravitational collapse, though the degree to which this is true
depends on the assumed parameters of our model. More robustly, the aligned
field case always produces higher concentrations of solids at small radii
compared to the anti-aligned case. In the in situ formation model, this bimodal
distribution of solid enhancement leads directly to the observed dichotomy in
exoplanet orbital distances.

variables in the Magellanic System. The stars pulsating simultaneously in the
fundamental (F) and first-overtone (1O) modes have distinctly different
properties than regular double-mode RR Lyrae variables (RRd stars). The
$P_{1O}/P_F$ period ratios of our anomalous RRd stars are within a range
0.725-0.738, while ""classical"" double-mode RR Lyrae variables have period
ratios in the range 0.742-0.748. In contrast to the typical RRd stars, in the
majority of the anomalous pulsators the F-mode amplitudes are higher than the
1O-mode amplitudes. The light curves associated with the F-mode in the
anomalous RRd stars show different morphology than the light curves of, both,
regular RRd stars and single-mode RRab stars. Most of the anomalous double-mode
stars show long-term modulations of the amplitudes (Blazhko-like effect).
Translating the period ratios into the abundance parameter, Z, we find for our
stars Z in the range (0.002,0.005) - an order of magnitude higher values than
typical for RR Lyrae stars. The mass range of the RRd stars inferred from the
$W_I$ vs. $P_F$ diagram is (0.55-0.75) of the solar mass. These parameters
cannot be accounted for with single star evolution assuming a Reimers-like mass
loss. Much greater mass loss caused by interaction with other stars is
postulated. We blame the peculiar pulsation properties of our stars to the
parametric resonance instability of the 1O-mode to excitation of the F- and
2O-modes as with the inferred parameters of the stars $2\omega_{\rm

vision for ground-based optical astronomy beyond the upcoming generation of
Extremely Large Telescopes. We make the case that a breakthrough in angular
resolution imaging capabilities is required in order to unravel the processes
involved in planet formation. PFI will be optimised to provide a complete
census of the protoplanet population at all stellocentric radii and over the
age range from 0.1 to about 100 Myr. Within this age period, planetary systems
undergo dramatic changes and the final architecture of planetary systems is
determined. Our goal is to study the planetary birth on the natural spatial
scale where the material is assembled, which is the ""Hill Sphere"" of the
forming planet, and to characterise the protoplanetary cores by measuring their
masses and physical properties. Our science working group has investigated the
observational characteristics of these young protoplanets as well as the
migration mechanisms that might alter the system architecture. We simulated the
imprints that the planets leave in the disk and study how PFI could
revolutionise areas ranging from exoplanet to extragalactic science. In this
contribution we outline the key science drivers of PFI and discuss the
requirements that will guide the technology choices, the site selection, and
potential science/technology tradeoffs.

multiple probes of the different phases of the ISM, which is key to understand
the interplay between energetic sources, the gas and dust at high redshift.
This kind of studies will be useful for a next-generation space observatory

the total population at z~2, to <1% by z~0.5. By comparing the mass functions
of quiescent galaxies to post-starburst galaxies at three cosmic epochs, we
show that rapid quenching of star formation can account for 100% of quiescent
galaxy formation, if the post-starburst spectral features are visible for
~250Myr. The flattening of the low mass end of the quiescent galaxy stellar
mass function seen at z~1 can be entirely explained by the addition of rapidly
quenched galaxies. Only if a significant fraction of post-starburst galaxies
have features that are visible for longer than 250Myr, or they acquire new gas
and return to the star-forming sequence, can there be significant growth of the
red sequence from a slower quenching route. The shape of the mass function of
these transitory post-starburst galaxies resembles that of quiescent galaxies
at z~2, with a preferred stellar mass of logM~10.6, but evolves steadily to
resemble that of star-forming galaxies at z<1. This leads us to propose a dual
origin for post-starburst galaxies: (1) at z>2 they are exclusively massive
galaxies that have formed the bulk of their stars during a rapid assembly
period, followed by complete quenching of further star formation, (2) at z<1
they are caused by the rapid quenching of gas-rich star-forming galaxies,
independent of stellar mass, possibly due to environment and/or gas-rich major
mergers.

adopt the spherical collapse picture by taking a closed FRW model in the
radiation dominated era to investigate PBH formation. Taking the initial

allow for both density and velocity perturbations. Our model gives a constraint
on the velocity perturbation. This model also predicts that the apparent

accretion of water depleted planetary material. Among tens of known cases,
merely two cases involve accretion of objects that contain a considerable mass
fraction of water. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative
scarcity of these detections. Based on a new and highly detailed model, we
evaluate the retention of water inside icy minor planets during the high
luminosity stellar evolution that follows the main sequence. Our model fully
considers the thermal, physical, and chemical evolution of icy bodies,
following their internal differentiation as well as water depletion, from the
moment of their birth and through all stellar evolution phases preceding the
formation of the white dwarf. We also account for different initial
compositions and formation times. Our results show that previous studies have
either underestimated or overestimated water retention. We also reaffirm that
water can survive in a variety of circumstances and in great quantities, and
therefore other possibilities are discussed in order to explain the infrequency
of water detections. We find that the most likely explanation is that water
does not survive the dissociation of tidally disrupted minor planets, and
instead a direct impact onto the white dwarf is required. We show that this
possibility is statistically plausible, and predict that if this hypothesis is
correct, future observations of extremely water rich atmospheres will involve
only helium dominated DB white dwarfs.

cosmology. Since the early 1950's it has been successfully applied for the
interpretation and prediction of astrophysical phenomena. Nuclear physics
models helped to explain the observed elemental and isotopic abundances and
star evolution and provided valuable insights on the Big Bang theory. Today,
the variety of elements observed in stellar surfaces, solar system and cosmic
rays, and isotope abundances are calculated and compared with the observed
values. Consequently, the overall success of the modeling critically depends on
the quality of underlying nuclear data that helps to bring physics of macro and
micro scales together. To broaden the scope of traditional nuclear astrophysics
activities and produce additional complementary information, I will investigate
applicability of the U.S. Nuclear Data Program (USNDP) databases for
astrophysical applications. EXFOR (Experimental Nuclear Reaction Data) and ENDF
(Evaluated Nuclear Data File) libraries have large astrophysics potential; the
former library contains experimental data sets while the latter library
includes evaluated neutron cross sections. ENSDF (Evaluated Nuclear Structure
Data File) database is a primary depository of nuclear structure and decay
rates information. The decay rates are essential in stellar nucleosynthesis
calculations, and these rates are evaluated using nuclear structure codes. The
structure evaluation codes are pure mathematical procedures that can be applied
to diverse data samples. A brief review of astrophysical nuclear data needs has
been presented. Several opportunities and the corresponding computer tools have
been identified. Further work will include extensive analysis of nuclear
databases and computer procedures for astrophysical calculations.

transmitting multiple data streams using a single RF chain and a single

pattern of the transmit antenna is exploited as extra dimension for encoding
information, near-field interaction of the transmit antenna with its
surrounding objects affects spatial multiplexing performance of the system.
Through numerical simulations in the previous work, it has been concluded that
under BPSK signaling beam-space MIMO is not more vulnerable to near-field
coupling than its conventional counterpart. In this work, we extend the study
to the case of higher-order modulation schemes, where the presence of external
perturbation also affects the data constellation points transmitted by a
beam-space MIMO antenna. To this aim, the error vector magnitude of the
transmitted signal is evaluated when placing a QPSK beam-space MIMO antenna in
close proximity to a hand model of the user. The obtained results emphasize the
importance of reconsidering the decoding approach for beam-space MIMO systems

research communities analyzing network datasets, including social, information,
and economic networks, as well as food webs, protein-protein interactions, and
neuronal networks. The most popular family of random graph null models, called
configuration models, are defined as uniform distributions over a space of
graphs with a fixed degree sequence. Commonly, properties of an empirical
network are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a
configuration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties
are meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the
particular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important
decisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and
investigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a
suite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of
specifying the appropriate graph labeling (stub-labeled or vertex-labeled)
under which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study
of random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the
choice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but
can have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with
self-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of
three vignettes, analyzing network datasets under many different configuration
models and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under
different models. We argue that in each case, only one of the possible
configuration models is appropriate. While our work focuses on undirected
static networks, it aims to guide the study of directed networks, dynamic
networks, and all other network contexts that are suitably studied through the
lens of random graph null models.

Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated

dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we
interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For
this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the
circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two
larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity
dispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical
to stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size
growth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a
faster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this
time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the
systematic rotation.

We employ a heuristic to construct the skipped steps DWT (SS-DWT) in an
image-adaptive way and define fixed SS-DWT variants. For a large and diverse
set of images, we find that SS-DWT significantly improves bitrates of
non-photographic images. From a practical standpoint, the most interesting
results are obtained by applying entropy estimation of coding effects for
selecting among the fixed SS-DWT variants. This way we get the compression
scheme that, as opposed to the general SS-DWT case, is compliant with the JPEG

the entire test-set, whereas the overall compression time becomes only 3%
greater than that of the unmodified JPEG 2000. Bitrates of photographic and

a significantly increased cost of exploiting a heuristic, selecting the steps
to be skipped based on the actual bitrate instead of an estimated one, and by
applying reversible denoising and lifting steps to SS-DWT, we have attained
greater bitrate improvements of up to about 17.5% for non-photographic images.

quantum and statistical mechanics, respectively. In the last decade the study
of quantum quenches revealed that these two concepts are intricately
intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial
state maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the
quench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble
with non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the
entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the
post-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in
isolated quantum systems. An exact computation of the entanglement dynamics has
been provided only for non-interacting systems, and it was believed to be
unfeasible for genuinely interacting models. Conversely, here we show that the
standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with
integrability-based knowledge of the asymptotic state, leads to a complete
analytical understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space-time scaling
limit. Our framework requires only knowledge about the steady state, and the
velocities of the low-lying excitations around it. We provide a thorough check

quenches from several initial states. We compare our results with numerical

KELT-16b joins WASP-18b, -19b, -43b, -103b, and HATS-18b as the only giant
transiting planets with $P < 1$ day. Its ultra-short period and high
irradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric studies by HST, Spitzer,
and eventually JWST. For example, as a hotter, higher mass analog of WASP-43b,
KELT-16b may feature an atmospheric temperature-pressure inversion and
day-to-night temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to rain out at the
terminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in extending tests of the
observed mass-metallicity relation of the Solar System gas giants to higher
masses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere $\sim$ 1.7 Roche radii from its
host star, and could be tidally disrupted in as little as a few $\times 10^{5}$
years (for a stellar tidal quality factor of $Q_*' = 10^5$). Finally, the
likely existence of a widely separated bound stellar companion in the KELT-16
system makes it possible that Kozai-Lidov oscillations played a role in driving
KELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.

redundant computational time, not to mention applicability to big streams. To
this end, the proposed mechanism supports incremental/decremental processing
for both single and multiple samples (i.e., batch processing). A large scale of
data can be divided into batches, processed by a machine, without sacrificing
the accuracy. Moreover, incremental/decremental analyses in empirical and
intrinsic space are also proposed in this study to handle different types of

typical methods focused only on one type. At the end of this study, we further
the proposed mechanism to statistical Kernelized Bayesian Regression, so that
uncertainty modeling with incremental/decremental computation becomes

significantly reduced, better than the original nonincremental design and the
typical single incremental method. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed
method remained the same as the baselines. This implied that the system
enhanced efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. These findings proved

popular community detection methods in networks are based on optimizing a
quality function known as the modularity score, which is a measure of presence

detection is defining a suitable modularity score that is appropriate for the

observations in networks from a diverse field of applications. In particular we
define the multi-layer configuration model, the multi-layer expected degree

two categories. The first category, which is based on degree corrected
multi-layer stochastic block model, has the multi-layer expected degree model

extensions of Newman-Girvan modularity, has the multi-layer configuration model

which prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce
a combinatorial strategy for the design of aperiodic yet frustration-free

voxels - which deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule which allows
cooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks fit as

metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, where the 2D pixelated
surface texture dictates the 3D interior voxel arrangement. Second, they act as
programmable shape shifters, morphing into spatially complex but predictable
and designable shapes when uniaxially compressed. Third, their mechanical
response to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform

cornerstones upon which many other methods for the numerical computation of
electrostatic interactions are based. However, their use with charge
distributions rather than point charges requires the inclusion of ansatz for
the solutions of the Poisson equation, since there is no exact solution known
for smeared out charges. The interest for incorporating electrostatic
interactions at the scales of length and time that are relevant for the study
the physics of soft condensed matter has increased considerably. Using
mesoscale simulation techniques, such as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD),
allows us to reach longer time scales in numerical simulations, without
abandoning the particulate description of the problem. The main problem with
incorporating electrostatics into DPD simulations is that DPD particles are
soft and those particles with opposite charge can form artificial clusters of
ions. Here we show that one can incorporate the electrostatic interactions
through Ewald sums with point charges in DPD if larger values of coarse
graining degree are used, where DPD is truly mesoscopic. Using point charges
with larger excluded volume interactions the artificial formation of ionic
pairs with point charges can be avoided, and one obtains correct predictions.
We establish ranges of parameters useful for detecting boundaries where
artificial formation of ionic pairs occurs. Lastly, using point charges we
predict the scaling properties of polyelectrolytes in solvents of varying
quality and obtain predictions that are in agreement with calculations that use

the first sub-leading electromagnetic multipole -- the magnetic dipole moment

algorithm to compute the strain gradient elastic tensors for various materials.
Numerical results are presented to compare representative interatomic
potentials used in the literature for cubic crystals, including simple lattices
and multi-lattices. We observe that central potentials exhibit generalized
Cauchy relations for the rank-six tensor of strain-gradient elastic moduli. In
addition, this tensor is found to be indefinite for many potentials. We discuss
the relationship between indefiniteness and material stability. Finally, the
atomistic representations are specialized to central potentials in simple
lattices. These expressions are used with analytical potentials to study the
sensitivity of the elastic tensors to the choice of the cutoff radius.

experimental Higgs boson results from Run I of the LHC and further low-energy
observables. We investigate various MSSM interpretations of the Higgs signal at
125 GeV. First, we consider the case where the light CP-even Higgs boson of the
MSSM is identified with the discovered Higgs boson. In this case it can
impersonate the SM Higgs-like signal either in the decoupling limit, or in the
limit of alignment without decoupling. In the latter case, the other states in
the Higgs sector can also be light, offering good prospects for upcoming LHC
searches and for searches at future colliders. Second, we demonstrate that the
heavy CP-even Higgs boson is still a viable candidate to explain the Higgs
signal - albeit only in a highly constrained parameter region, that will be
probed by LHC searches for the CP-odd Higgs boson and the charged Higgs boson
in the near future. As a guidance for such searches we provide new benchmark
scenarios that can be employed to maximize the sensitivity of the experimental
analysis to this interpretation.

DM interactions with the nucleus are mediated by higher electromagnetic
moments, which, for Majorana DM, is the anapole moment. After giving a full
analytic calculation of the anapole moment, including its $\alpha$ dependence,
and matching with limits in the literature, we compute the DM-nucleon
scattering cross-section and show the LUX and future LZ constraints on the

coming from $Fermi$-LAT continuum and line searches. Results in the

find that future direct detection experiments will be able to probe most of the
parameter space of these models for $\mathcal{O}(100-200)$ GeV DM and lightest

also attenuated near certain ""blind spots"" in the parameter space, where the

solving the two-dimensional Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In order to accomplish
this, we convert the Monge-Amp\`ere equation to an equivalent
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Based on the HJB formulation, we apply
the standard 7-point stencil discretization, which is second order accurate, to
the grid points wherever monotonicity holds, and apply semi-Lagrangian wide
stencil discretization elsewhere to ensure monotonicity on the entire
computational domain. By dividing the admissible control set into six regions
and optimizing the sub-problem in each region, the computational cost of the
optimization problem at each grid point is reduced from $O(M^2)$ to $O(1)$ when
the standard 7-point stencil discretization is applied and to $O(M)$ otherwise,
where the discretized control set is $M \times M$. We prove that our numerical
scheme satisfies consistency, stability, monotonicity and strong comparison
principle, and hence is convergent to the viscosity solution of the
Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In the numerical results, second order convergence
rate is achieved when the standard 7-point stencil discretization is applied
monotonically on the entire computation domain, and up to order one convergence
is achieved otherwise. The proposed mixed scheme yields a smaller
discretization error and a faster convergence rate compared to the pure
semi-Lagrangian wide stencil scheme.

produce a correct controller, when it exists. In the present paper, we consider
a class of concurrent, weighted, multi-player games that are well-suited to
model and study the interactions of several agents who are competing for some
measurable resources like energy. We prove that a subclass of those games
always admit a Nash equilibrium, i.e. a situation in which all players play in
such a way that they have no incentive to deviate. Moreover, the strategies
yielding those Nash equilibria have a special structure: when one of the agents
deviate from the equilibrium, all the others form a coalition that will enforce
a retaliation mechanism that punishes the deviant agent. We apply those results
to a real-life case study in which several smart houses that produce their own
energy with solar panels, and can share this energy among them in micro-grid,
must distribute the use of this energy along the day in order to avoid
consuming electricity that must be bought from the global grid. We demonstrate
that our theory allows one to synthesise an efficient controller for these

force the houses to follow a pre-computed schedule that maximises the

simulation where a single transitions can be matched by a sequence of
transitions while preserving the branching behavior. We relax this notion to
allow for a small degree of deviation in the matching of weights, inducing a
directed distance on states. The distance between two states can be used
directly to relate properties of the states within a sub-fragment of weighted
CTL. The problem of relating systems thus changes to minimizing the distance
which, in the general parametric case, corresponds to finding suitable
parameter valuations such that one system can approximately simulate another.
Although the distance considers a potentially infinite set of transition
sequences we demonstrate that there exists an upper bound on the length of
relevant sequences, thereby establishing the computability of the distance.

of this approach is a theorem formulated for two sets of functions localized in

provides an integral representation for each function. A corollary of this
theorem yields Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. It is pointed out
that the causality principle and the conservation of electric and magnetic
charges are the most fundamental physical axioms underlying these equations.
Another application of the corollary yields Maxwell's equations in material
media. The theorem is also formulated in the Minkowski space-time and applied
to obtain the covariant form of Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles and
the covariant form of Maxwell's equations in material media. The approach makes
use of the infinite-space Green function of the wave equation and is therefore
suitable for an advanced course in electrodynamics.

multicarrier scheme in the 5th generation cellular networks for its flexibility
of transmitter filter in time and frequency. However, for the circularly shaped
transmitter filter, GFDM provides limited performance gain of sidelobe
suppression. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called time-domain
N-continuous GFDM (TD-NC-GFDM), to reduce the discontinuities caused by the
GFDM transmitter filter and achieve promising sidelobe suppression gain. Based
on time-domain N-continuous orthogonal frequency devision multiplexing
(TD-NC-OFDM), TD-NC-GFDM signal can be obtained by superposing a smooth signal
in the time domain. The smooth signal is linearly combined by basis signals in
a new basis set related to GFDM transmitter waveform. To eliminate the
interference caused by the smooth signal, two solutions are proposed. Firstly,
a signal recovery algorithm for reception is adopted at the cost of high
complexity. Thus, secondly, to simplify the TD-NC-GFDM receiver, a
low-interference TD-NC-GFDM is proposed by redesigning the basis signals. A
soft truncation of the basis signals in TD-NC-GFDM is given to design the basis
signals in the low-interference TD-NC-GFDM. Then, the smooth signal is aligned
with the beginning of the GFDM symbol and is added in the front part of the
GFDM symbol. Moreover, for a big number of GFDM subsymbols, theoretical
analysis proves that the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in TD-NC-GFDM is
much higher than that in TD-NC-OFDM. Simulation results shows that TD-NC-GFDM
can obtain significant sidelobe suppression performance as well as the
low-interference TD-NC-GFDM, which can achieve the same BER performance as the
original GFDM.

Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of a general loss distribution is usually difficult,
because 1) the loss function might lack structural properties such as convexity
or differentiability since it is often generated via black-box simulation of a
stochastic system; 2) evaluation of risk measures often requires rare-event
simulation, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we study the
extension of the recently proposed gradient-based adaptive stochastic search
(GASS) to the optimization of risk measures VaR and CVaR. Instead of optimizing
VaR or CVaR at the target risk level directly, we incorporate an adaptive
updating scheme on the risk level, by initializing the algorithm at a small
risk level and adaptively increasing it until the target risk level is achieved
while the algorithm converges at the same time. This enables us to adaptively
reduce the number of samples required to estimate the risk measure at each

Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellites. Here, we present flux
enhancements with 30--100-keV electrons related to NWC transmitter for the
first time, which were observed by the GOES satellite at night. Similar to the
100--300-keV precipitated-electron havior, the low energy 30--100-keV electron
precipitation is primarily located east of the transmitter. However, the latter
does not drift eastward to the same extent as the former, possibly because of
the lower electron velocity. The 30--100-keV electrons are distributed in the
L=1.8--2.1 shell range, in contrast to the 100--300-keV electrons which are at
L=1.67--1.9. This is consistent with the perspective that the energy of the
VLF-wave-induced electron flux enhancement decreases with higher L-shell
values. We expand upon the rationality of the simultaneous enhancement of the
30--100- and 100--300-keV electron fluxes through comparison with the cyclotron

initiates a pioneering study on whether active learning experience can be

represent the active learning experience. We equip the model with the popular
linear upper- confidence-bound (LinUCB) algorithm for contextual bandit to
update the weights. Finally, we extend our model to transfer the experience

cyber-attackers, but making the decision about what security tools to deploy to
mitigate this risk requires carefully designed evaluation of security products.
One of the most important metrics for a protection product is how well it is
able to stop malware, specifically on ""zero""-day malware that has not been seen
by the security community before. However, evaluating zero-day performance is
difficult, because of larger number of previously unseen samples that are
needed to properly measure the true and false positive rate, and the challenges
involved in accurately labeling these samples. This paper addresses these
issues from a statistical and practical perspective. Our contributions include
first showing that the number of benign files needed for proper evaluation is
on the order of a millions, and the number of malware samples needed is on the
order of tens of thousands. We then propose and justify a time-delay method for
easily collecting large number of previously unseen, but labeled, samples. This
enables cheap and accurate evaluation of zero-day true and false positive
rates. Finally, we propose a more fine-grain labeling of the malware/benignware

features four giant planets and two debris belts, analogues to the Asteroid and
Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations
of HR 8799's inner debris belt, to study its structure and collisional
environment.
  Our results suggest that HR 8799's inner belt is highly structured, with gaps
between regions of dynamical stability. The belt is likely constrained between
sharp inner and outer edges, located at ~6 and ~8 au, respectively. Its inner
edge coincides with a broad gap cleared by the 4:1 mean-motion resonance with
HR 8799e.
  Within the belt, planetesimals are undergoing a process of collisional
attrition like that observed in the Asteroid belt. However, whilst the mean
collision velocity in the Asteroid belt exceeds 5 km/s, the majority of
collisions within HR 8799's inner belt occur with velocities of order 1.2 km/s,
or less. Despite this, they remain sufficiently energetic to be destructive -
giving a source for the warm dust detected in the system.
  Interior to the inner belt, test particles remain dynamically unstirred,
aside from narrow bands excited by distant high-order resonances with HR 8799e.
This lack of stirring is consistent with earlier thermal modelling of HR 8799's
infrared excess, which predicted little dust inside 6 au. The inner system is
sufficiently stable and unstirred that the formation of telluric planets is
feasible, although such planets would doubtless be subject to a punitive impact
regime, given the intense collisional grinding required in the inner belt to
generate the observed infrared excess.

the $\Lambda$CDM model. We employ the Planck 2015 data of CMB temperature and
polarization anisotropies, combined with low-redshift measurements on BAO
distance scales, type Ia supernovae, Hubble constant, and Planck lensing.
Compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, our study shows that the upper limit on

the HDE model. In the HDE model, we obtain the $95\%$ CL upper limit $\sum

most stringent constraint on $\sum m_{\nu}$ by far and is almost on the verge

algorithms are known for such problems under both monotone and non-monotone

elements are not all active and we can only get value from active elements.
Each element $e$ is active independently with some known probability $p_e$, but
we don't know the element's status \emph{a priori}. We find it out only when we
\emph{probe} the element $e$---probing reveals whether it's active or not,
whereafter we can use this information to decide which other elements to probe.
Eventually, if we have a probed set $S$ and a subset $\text{active}(S)$ of
active elements in $S$, we can pick any $T \subseteq \text{active}(S)$ and get
value $f(T)$. Moreover, the sequence of elements we probe must satisfy a given
\emph{prefix-closed constraint}---e.g., these may be given by a matroid, or an
orienteering constraint, or deadline, or precedence constraint, or an arbitrary
downward-closed constraint---if we can probe some sequence of elements we can
probe any prefix of it. What is a good strategy to probe elements to maximize
the expected value?
  In this paper we study the gap between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies
for $f$ being a submodular or a fractionally subadditive (XOS) function. If
this gap is small, we can focus on finding good non-adaptive strategies
instead, which are easier to find as well as to represent. We show that the
adaptivity gap is a constant for monotone and non-monotone submodular

bounds are nearly tight. Our techniques show new ways of arguing about the

will cover a 1.3 degree diameter field with 2394 fibers to complement the
imaging capabilities of Hyper SuprimeCam. To retain high throughput, the final
positioning accuracy between the fibers and observing targets of PFS is
required to be less than 10um. The metrology camera system (MCS) serves as the
optical encoder of the fiber motors for the configuring of fibers. MCS provides
the fiber positions within a 5um error over the 45 cm focal plane. The
information from MCS will be fed into the fiber positioner control system for
the closed loop control. MCS will be located at the Cassegrain focus of Subaru
telescope in order to to cover the whole focal plane with one 50M pixel Canon
CMOS camera. It is a 380mm Schmidt type telescope which generates a uniform
spot size with a 10 micron FWHM across the field for reasonable sampling of
PSF. Carbon fiber tubes are used to provide a stable structure over the
operating conditions without focus adjustments. The CMOS sensor can be read in
0.8s to reduce the overhead for the fiber configuration. The positions of all
fibers can be obtained within 0.5s after the readout of the frame. This enables
the overall fiber configuration to be less than 2 minutes. MCS will be
installed inside a standard Subaru Cassgrain Box. All components that generate
heat are located inside a glycol cooled cabinet to reduce the possible image
motion due to heat. The optics and camera for MCS have been delivered and
tested. The mechanical parts and supporting structure are ready as of spring
2016. The integration of MCS will start in the summer of 2016.

show that the anomalous pair breaking becomes prominent below about 0.15 K in
any field direction, but occurs closer to $H_{\rm c2}$ for $H \parallel c$. The
presence of this anomaly is confirmed by the fact that the specific-heat and

structure, field-angle dependences of the low-temperature specific heat within
the $ab$ and $ac$ planes do not show any evidence for gap nodes. From
microscopic calculations in the framework of a two-band full-gap model, the
power-law-like temperature dependences of $C$ and $1/T_1$, reminiscent of nodal

multiband full-gap superconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$.

classical systems, but for an isolated quantum system there is no general
understanding on how equilibrium states dynamically emerge from the microscopic
Hamiltonian. For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually
fail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale and, instead,
relax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by
statistical mechanics when approximately conserved quantities are appropriately
included in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Here we experimentally study
the relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a
long-range transverse field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For
sufficiently long-ranged interactions the system relaxes to a new type of
prethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. In
this case, the prethermal state cannot be described by a GGE, but rather arises
from an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This
result shows that prethermalization occurs in a significantly broader context
than previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding
of the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of
long-range interactions.

opinion of honest reviewers. We propose a lightweight, effective method for
detecting opinion spammers based on these differences. This method uses
binomial regression to identify reviewers having an anomalous proportion of

intervals for a single coordinate of $\beta$? (where $\beta$ is the true
regression vector).
  We show through a mix of numerical and theoretical work that the bootstrap is
fraught with problems. Both of the most commonly used methods of bootstrapping
for regression -- residual bootstrap and pairs bootstrap -- give very poor
inference on $\beta$ as the ratio $p/n$ grows. We find that the residuals
bootstrap tend to give anti-conservative estimates (inflated Type I error),
while the pairs bootstrap gives very conservative estimates (severe loss of
power) as the ratio $p/n$ grows. We also show that the jackknife resampling
technique for estimating the variance of $\hat{\beta}$ severely overestimates
the variance in high dimensions.
  We contribute alternative bootstrap procedures based on our theoretical
results that mitigate these problems. However, the corrections depend on
assumptions regarding the underlying data-generation model, suggesting that in
high-dimensions it may be difficult to have universal, robust bootstrapping
techniques.

reliably to recipient Bob without detection by warden Willie, with additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels between all parties, communication is
limited to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits in $n$ channel uses. However, this
assumes Willie has an accurate statistical characterization of the channel.
When Willie has uncertainty about such and his receiver is limited to a
threshold test on the received power, Alice can transmit covertly with a power
that does not decrease with $n$, thus conveying $\mathcal{O}(n)$ bits covertly
and reliably in $n$ uses of an AWGN channel. Here, we consider covert
communication of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ bits in $n$ channel uses while generalizing
the environment and removing any restrictions on Willie's receiver. We assume
an uninformed ""jammer"" is present to help Alice, and we consider AWGN and block
fading channels. In some scenarios, Willie's optimal detector is a threshold
test on the received power. When the channel between the jammer and Willie has
multiple fading blocks per codeword, a threshold test on the received power is
not optimal. However, we establish that Alice can remain covert with a transmit

to random variables, we explore the equilibrium properties of the corresponding
fluctuating contact line problem based on an interfacial Hamiltonian involving
a ""contact"" binding potential. To facilitate an analytical treatment we
consider the case of a one-dimensional interface. The effective boundary
condition at the contact line is determined by a dimensionless parameter that
encodes the relative importance of thermal energy and substrate energy at the
microscopic scale. We find that this parameter controls the transition from a
partially wetting to a pseudo-partial wetting state, the latter being
characterized by a thin prewetting film of fixed thickness. In the partial
wetting regime, instead, the profile typically approaches the substrate via an
exponentially thinning prewetting film. We show that, independently of the
physics at the microscopic scale, Young's angle is recovered sufficiently far
from the substrate. The fluctuations of the interface and of the contact line
give rise to an effective disjoining pressure, exponentially decreasing with
height. Fluctuations therefore provide a regularization of the singular contact
forces occurring in the corresponding deterministic problem.

detection of money laundering without prior knowledge of predicate crimes
remains a significant challenge. Previous detection systems have tended to
focus on individuals, considering transaction histories and applying anomaly
detection to identify suspicious behaviour. However, money laundering involves
groups of collaborating individuals, and evidence of money laundering may only
be apparent when the collective behaviour of these groups is considered. In
this paper we describe a detection system that is capable of analysing group
behaviour, using a combination of network analysis and supervised learning.
This system is designed for real-world application and operates on networks
consisting of millions of interacting parties. Evaluation of the system using
real-world data indicates that suspicious activity is successfully detected.
Importantly, the system exhibits a low rate of false positives, and is
therefore suitable for use in a live intelligence environment.

called a key that is only known to themselves. Classically, Alice and Bob could
never be certain that their communication was not compromised by a malicious
eavesdropper. Quantum mechanics however makes secure communication possible.
The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that taking a measurement
perturbs the system (unless the measurement is compatible with the quantum

the key, Alice and Bob can detect the presence of an eavesdropper by errors in
their measurements. As part of the QuVis Quantum Mechanics Visualization

demonstrate the basic principles of three different quantum key distribution

elevated temperatures, basic data obtained from ground state energetics are
used in the modeling of these phenomena. In order to illustrate the effect of
phonon and electron excitations on the free binding energy of defect clusters,
first-principles calculations are performed for vacancy-solute pairs as well as
vacancy and Cu dimers, trimers, and quadromers in bcc Fe. Based on the
equilibrium atomic positions determined by the relaxation of the supercell with
the defect in the ground state under constant volume (CV) as well as zero
pressure (ZP) conditions, the contribution of phonon excitations to the free
binding energy is calculated within the framework of the harmonic
approximation. The contribution of electron excitations is obtained using the
corresponding ground state data for the electronic density of states.
Quasi-harmonic corrections to the ZP-based results do not yield significant
changes in the temperature range relevant for applications. At 1000 K the
maximum decrease/increase of the ZP-based data for the absolute value of the
free binding energy with respect to the corresponding ground state value is
found for the vacancy-W (43%) / vacancy-Mn (35%) pair. These results clearly
demonstrate that contributions of phonon and electron excitation to the free
binding energy of the defect clusters are generally not negligible. The general
behavior of the free binding energy of vacancy and Cu dimers, trimers and
quadromers is similar to that of the vacancy-solute pairs. The results obtained
in this work are of general importance for studies on the thermodynamics and

sensing devices based on the laws of quantum physics that outperform some of

probe prepared in an entangled state can, in principle, lead to a precision
gain compared to a probe prepared in a separable state. Even in the presence of
some forms of decoherence, it has been shown that the precision gain can
increase with the number of probe particles $N$. Usually, however, the
entangled and separable state preparation and readout times are assumed to be
negligible. We find that a probe in a maximally entangled (GHZ) state can give
an advantage over a separable state only if the entangled state preparation and
readout times are lower than a certain threshold. When the probe system suffers
dephasing, this threshold is much lower (and more difficult to attain) than it
is for an isolated probe. Further, we find that in realistic situations the

users can use them to commit crimes or launch terror attacks, thus imposing new
threats on the public security. To quickly respond to defend these attacks,
authorized parities (e.g., the National Security Agency of the USA) need to
intervene in the malicious communication links over the air. This paper
investigates this emerging wireless communication intervention problem at the
physical layer. Unlike prior studies using jamming to disrupt or disable the
targeted wireless communications, we propose a new physical-layer spoofing
approach to change their communicated information. Consider a fundamental
three-node system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, in which
an intermediary legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious communication link
from Alice to Bob, such that the received message at Bob is changed from
Alice's originally sent message to the one desired by the spoofer. We propose a
new symbol-level spoofing scheme, where the spoofer designs the spoofing signal
via exploiting the symbol-level relationship between each original
constellation point of Alice and the desirable one of the spoofer. In
particular, the spoofer aims to minimize the average spoofing-symbol-error-rate
(SSER), which is defined as the average probability that the symbols decoded by
Bob fail to be changed or spoofed, by designing its spoofing signals over
symbols subject to the average transmit power constraint. By considering two
cases when Alice employs the widely-used binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and
quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulations, we obtain the respective
optimal solutions to the two average SSER minimization problems. Numerical
results show that the symbol-level spoofing scheme with optimized transmission
achieves a much lower average SSER, as compared to other benchmark schemes.

tractable in practice, it was only recently shown that advanced reductions (in

millions of vertices [Akiba and Iwata, TCS 2016]. In this paper we compare
these state-of-the-art reductions against a small suite of simple reductions,
and come to two conclusions: just two simple reductions---vertex folding and
isolated vertex removal---are sufficient for many real-world instances, and
further, the power of the advanced rules comes largely from their initial
application (i.e., kernelization), and not their repeated application during
branch-and-bound. As a part of our comparison, we give the first experimental
evaluation of a reduction based on maximum critical independent sets, and show
it is highly effective in practice for medium-sized networks.

therefore require a mechanism to autonomously discover these environmental
factors, or sensorimotor contexts.
  This paper presents a method to discover sensorimotor contexts in partially
observable environments, by constructing a hierarchical transition model. The
method is evaluated in a simulation experiment, in which a robot learns that
different rooms are characterized by different objects that are found in them.

correlated random variables, one crucial issue is to determine a suitable
correlation coefficient $\rho_z$ in normal space for two variables with
correlation coefficient $\rho_x$. This paper attempts to address this problem.
For two continuous variables, the marginal transformation is approximated by a
weighted sum of Hermite polynomials, then, with Mehler's formula, a polynomial
of $\rho_z$ is derived to approximate the function relationship between
$\rho_x$ and $\rho_z$. If a discrete variable is involved, the marginal
transformation is decomposed into piecewise continuous ones, and $\rho_x$ is
expressed as a polynomial of $\rho_z$ by Taylor expansion. For a given
$\rho_x$, $\rho_z$ can be efficiently determined by solving a polynomial

of mass $M$ confined within a perfectly reflecting cavity of radius R in
thermal equilibrium with various species of radiation and fermions . Charge
conservation is constrained by a Lagrange multiplier (the chemical potential).
Black hole charge fluctuations are expected owing to continuous absorption and
emission of particles by the black hole. For black holes much more massive than
$10^{16} g$ , these fluctuations are exponentially suppressed. For black holes
lighter than this, the Schwarzschild black hole is unstable under charge
fluctuations for almost every possible size of the confining vessel. The
stability regime and the fluctuations are calculated through the second
derivative of the entropy with respect to the charge. The expression obtained
contains many puzzling terms besides the expected thermodynamical fluctuations:
terms corresponding to instabilities that do not depend on the specific value
of charge of the charge carriers and one of them depends on Newton's constant
instead. One of the contributions to the charge fluctuations $\hbar/4\pi$ does
not depend neither on number of species, nor on the the specific charge or even
the size of the confining vessel. As a matter of fact, this term emerges from
the second derivative of the black hole entropy alone, which means that it
corresponds to a genuine quantum mechanical property of the black hole itself.
Such a contribution would cause the event horizon to recede from $2M$ to
$2M-T_{BH}$ or equivalently, by $(4\pi)^{-1}$ of the black hole' s Compton wave
length. Similarly, a Cauchy horizon emerges at the same distance the event
horizon receded.

i.e., the enstrophy diverges while the single-shell velocities stay finite. The
signature of this blowup is represented by self-similar instantonic structures
traveling coherently through the inertial range. These solutions might
influence the energy transfer and the anomalous scaling properties empirically
observed for the forced and viscous models. In this paper we present a study of
the instantonic solutions for a set of four shell models of turbulence based on
the exact decomposition of the Navier-Stokes equations in helical eigenstates.
We find that depending on the helical structure of each model, instantons are
chaotic or regular. Some instantonic solutions tend to recover mirror symmetry
for scales small enough. Models that have anomalous scaling develop regular non
chaotic instantons. Conversely, models that have non anomalous scaling in the
stationary regime are those that have chaotic instantons. The direction of the
energy carried by each single instanton tends to coincide with the direction of
the energy cascade in the stationary regime. Finally, we find that whenever the
small-scale stationary statistics is intermittent, the instanton is less steep
than the dimensional Kolmogorov scaling, independently of whether or not it is
chaotic. Our findings further support the idea that instantons might be crucial
to describe some aspects of the multi-scale anomalous statistics of shell
models.

for such a suggestion is a re-plotting of our data, giving a bond distance of
5.0 pm instead of 2.3 pm, corresponding to state s = 3 instead of s = 2 in the
ultra-dense hydrogen. However, protium has indeed been studied on the next

also rejects the rotational energy transfer model as due to our use of D in the

previous publications, including experiments using protium. Hansen also
suggests that the protium is due to a contamination of the source; however, the

faint nearby star was subsequently detected, whose contamination of the transit
light curves might explain this anomaly. We present a reanalysis of published
data in order to characterise the faint star and assess its effect on the
measured transmission spectrum. The faint star has a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.08 Msun
and is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the planetary system. We find
that its effect on the measured physical properties of the planet and host star
is small, amounting to a planetary radius larger by 0.6 sigma and planetary
density smaller by 0.8 sigma. Its influence on the measured transmission
spectrum is much greater: the spectrum now has a minimum around 760 nm and
opacity rises to both bluer and redder wavelengths. It is a poor match to
theoretical spectra and the spectral slope remains too strong for Rayleigh
scattering. The existence of the faint nearby star cannot therefore explain the
measured spectral properties of this hot and inflated planet. We advocate
further observations of the system, both with high spatial resolution in order
to improve the measured properties of the faint star, and with higher spectral
resolution to confirm the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet.

logical organisation and discourse flow. Even though coherence is a relatively
difficult notion to quantify precisely, it can be approximated automatically.
This type of coherence modelling is not only interesting in itself, but also
useful for a number of other text processing tasks, including Information
Retrieval (IR), where adjusting the ranking of documents according to both
their relevance and their coherence has been shown to increase retrieval
effectiveness [34,37].
  The state of the art in unsupervised coherence modelling represents documents
as bipartite graphs of sentences and discourse entities, and then projects
these bipartite graphs into one-mode undirected graphs. However, one-mode
projections may incur significant loss of the information present in the
original bipartite structure. To address this we present three novel graph
metrics that compute document coherence on the original bipartite graph of
sentences and entities. Evaluation on standard settings shows that: (i) one of
our coherence metrics beats the state of the art in terms of coherence
accuracy; and (ii) all three of our coherence metrics improve retrieval
effectiveness because, as closer analysis reveals, they capture aspects of
document quality that go undetected by both keyword-based standard ranking and
by spam filtering. This work contributes document coherence metrics that are
theoretically principled, parameter-free, and useful to IR.

eliminates inconsistencies between shadow and shadow-free images and provides a

Local distortions of an average curve of polarisation angle (PA) can be
identified in such profiles, and they are often found to be associated with
absorption features or narrow emission components. The features may be
interpreted as a convolution of a lateral profile of an emitter with a
microscopic radiation pattern of a non-negligible angular extent. We study a
model which assumes that such an extended microbeam of the X-mode curvature
radiation is spreading the radiation polarised at a fixed position angle within
an interval of pulse phase. The model is capable of interpreting the strongly
dissimilar polarisation of double notches in PSR B1821-24A (for which we
present new polarisation data from the Nancay Radio Telescope) and PSR
J0437-4715. It also explains a step-like change in PA observed at the
bifurcated trailing component in the profile of J0437-4715. A generic form of
the modelled PA distortion is a zigzag-shaped wiggle, which in the presence of
the second polarisation mode (O mode) can be magnified or transformed into a W-
or U-shaped deflection of a total net PA. The model's efficiency in
interpreting dissimilar polarisation effects provides further credence to the
stream-based (fan-beam) geometry of pulsar emission. It also suggests that the
microbeam width may not always be assumed negligible in comparison with the
angular scale of emissivity gradients in the emission region.

derived rotation periods for 97 stars (79 of which without previous period
measurement), as well as various measures for activity related to cool spots
and flares. We find a clear difference between fast and slow rotators with a
dividing line at a period of ~10d at which the activity level changes abruptly.
All photometric diagnostics of activity (spot cycle amplitude, flare peak
amplitude and residual variability after subtraction of spot and flare
variations) display the same dichotomy, pointing to a quick transition between
a high-activity mode for fast rotators and a low-activity mode for slow
rotators. This unexplained behavior is reminiscent of a dynamo mode-change seen
in numerical simulations that separates a dipolar from a multipolar regime. A
substantial number of the fast rotators are visual binaries. A tentative
explanation is accelerated disk evolution in binaries leading to higher initial
rotation rates on the main-sequence and associated longer spin-down and
activity lifetimes. We combine the K2 rotation periods with archival X-ray and

differences are observed for spherical nanoparticles with respect to faceted

sites is more competitive with self-trapping processes in faceted than in
spherical nanoparticles. This relates to the fact that selective compression or
elongation of Ti-O bonds play a key role in determining the effectiveness of
trapping sites, with spherical nanoparticles being more flexible. Moreover,

resolution imagery (< 10cm) requires statistical models able to learn high
level concepts from spatial data, with large appearance variations.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve this goal by learning
discriminatively a hierarchy of representations of increasing abstraction.
  In this paper we present a CNN-based system relying on an
downsample-then-upsample architecture. Specifically, it first learns a rough
spatial map of high-level representations by means of convolutions and then
learns to upsample them back to the original resolution by deconvolutions. By
doing so, the CNN learns to densely label every pixel at the original
resolution of the image. This results in many advantages, including i)
state-of-the-art numerical accuracy, ii) improved geometric accuracy of
predictions and iii) high efficiency at inference time.
  We test the proposed system on the Vaihingen and Potsdam sub-decimeter
resolution datasets, involving semantic labeling of aerial images of 9cm and
5cm resolution, respectively. These datasets are composed by many large and
fully annotated tiles allowing an unbiased evaluation of models making use of
spatial information. We do so by comparing two standard CNN architectures to
the proposed one: standard patch classification, prediction of local label
patches by employing only convolutions and full patch labeling by employing
deconvolutions. All the systems compare favorably or outperform a
state-of-the-art baseline relying on superpixels and powerful appearance
descriptors. The proposed full patch labeling CNN outperforms these models by a
large margin, also showing a very appealing inference time.

persists for $O(N^{1/3})$ time and the remaining nodes become vulnerable. Those

among terms in a vocabulary. In this paper, we develop exponential family
embeddings, a class of methods that extends the idea of word embeddings to
other types of high-dimensional data. As examples, we studied neural data with
real-valued observations, count data from a market basket analysis, and ratings
data from a movie recommendation system. The main idea is to model each
observation conditioned on a set of other observations. This set is called the
context, and the way the context is defined is a modeling choice that depends
on the problem. In language the context is the surrounding words; in
neuroscience the context is close-by neurons; in market basket data the context
is other items in the shopping cart. Each type of embedding model defines the
context, the exponential family of conditional distributions, and how the
latent embedding vectors are shared across data. We infer the embeddings with a
scalable algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent. On all three
applications - neural activity of zebrafish, users' shopping behavior, and
movie ratings - we found exponential family embedding models to be more
effective than other types of dimension reduction. They better reconstruct
held-out data and find interesting qualitative structure.

theory (DFT) calculations are first used to calculate the energy parameters and
charge states of possible diffusion mechanisms. Based on the DFT results,
continuum modeling and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are then performed. The
model is able to reproduce experimental Be concentration profiles. Our results
suggest that the Frank-Turnbull mechanism is not likely, instead, kick-out
reactions are the dominant mechanism. Due to a large reaction energy
difference, the Ga interstitial and the In interstitial play different roles in
the kick-out reactions, contrary to what is usually assumed. The DFT
calculations also suggest that the influence of As on Be diffusion may not be
negligible.

the dynamics of binary star systems with a planet in tadpole motion. We did
numerical simulations by using the full three-body problem as dynamical model.
The stability and the ETVs are investigated by computing stability/ETV maps for
different masses of the secondary star and the Trojan planet. In addition we
changed the eccentricity of the possible Trojan planet. By the help of the
libration amplitude $\sigma$ we could show whether or not all stable objects
are moving in tadpole orbits. We can conclude that many amplitudes of ETVs are
large enough to detect Earth-like Trojan planets in binary star systems. As an
application, we prepared a list of possible candidates.

An
important task in the online evaluation of rankers is using implicit user
feedback for inferring preferences between rankers. Interleaving methods have
been found to be efficient and sensitive, i.e. they can quickly detect even
small differences in quality. It has recently been shown that multileaving
methods exhibit similar sensitivity but can be more efficient than interleaving
methods. This paper presents empirical results demonstrating that existing
multileaving methods either do not scale well with the number of rankers, or,
more problematically, can produce results which substantially differ from
evaluation measures like NDCG. The latter problem is caused by the fact that
they do not correctly account for the similarities that can occur between
rankers being multileaved. We propose a new multileaving method for handling
this problem and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms existing
methods, in some cases reducing errors by as much as 50%.

associating a functional to any quadratic differential on $R$ with specified

related to a network of participants, where an edge in the network relates to
the presence of a communication between those two participants. Recent work by
Dimitrov, Kress and Nevo has shown that using the information about the network
structure together with a modelling assumption that relevant items and

screening relevant items. However their approach is computationally expensive
and thus limited in applicability to small networks. Here we show how Bayes

characterize the impact of artificial noise in such networks. Our results
reveal that in the low transmit powerregime, the use of low mmWave frequency
achieves better secrecy performance, and when increasing transmit power, a
transition from low mmWave frequency to high mmWave frequency is demanded for
obtaining a higher secrecy rate. More antennas at the transmitting nodes are
needed to decrease the antenna gain obtained by the eavesdroppers when using
ULA. Eavesdroppers can intercept more information by using a wide beam pattern.
Furthermore, the use of artificial noise may be ineffective for enhancing the

based on dissipationless propagation of spin currents. They are two-dimensional
(2D) representatives of the family of topological insulators, which exhibit
conduction channels at their edges inherently protected against scattering.
Initially predicted for graphene, and eventually realized in HgTe quantum
wells, in the QSH systems realized so far, the decisive bottleneck preventing
applications is the small bulk energy gap of less than 30 meV, requiring
cryogenic operation temperatures in order to suppress detrimental bulk
contributions to the edge conductance. Room-temperature functionalities,
however, require much larger gaps. Here we show how this can be achieved by
making use of a new QSH paradigm based on substrate-supported atomic monolayers
of a high-Z element. Experimentally, the material is synthesized as honeycomb
lattice of bismuth atoms, forming ""bismuthene"", on top of the wide-gap
substrate SiC(0001). Consistent with the theoretical expectations, the
spectroscopic signatures in experiment display a huge gap of ~0.8 eV in
bismuthene, as well as conductive edge states. The analysis of the
layer-substrate orbitals arrives at a QSH phase, whose topological gap - as a
hallmark mechanism - is driven directly by the atomic spin-orbit coupling
(SOC). Our results demonstrate how strained artificial lattices of heavy atoms,
in contact with an insulating substrate, can be utilized to evoke a novel
topological wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential is located well
within the global system gap, ensuring pure edge state conductance. We
anticipate future experiments on topological signatures, such as transport
measurements that probe the QSH effect via quantized universal conductance,
notably at room temperature.

binary local features. On the other hand, aggregation techniques provide a
meaningful summarization of all the extracted feature of an image into a single

works have recently mixed together these two research directions, defining
aggregation methods for binary local features, in order to leverage on the

results show that aggregation methods on binary features are effective and
represent a worthwhile alternative to the direct matching. Moreover, the

allowed us to obtain a relative improvement over the CNN results that is in
line with that recently obtained using the combination of the CNN with the FV

that the extraction process of binary features is about two order of magnitude

an outcome is popular in econometrics, and increasingly so in epidemiology.
This increasing popularity may be attributed to the natural occurrence of
instrumental variables in observational studies that incorporate elements of
randomization, either by design or by nature (e.g., random inheritance of
genes). Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects is well
established for continuous outcomes and to some extent for binary outcomes. It
is, however, largely lacking for time-to-event outcomes because of
complications due to censoring and survivorship bias. In this paper, we make a
novel proposal under a class of structural cumulative survival models which
parameterize time-varying effects of a point exposure directly on the scale of
the survival function; these models are essentially equivalent with a
semi-parametric variant of the instrumental variables additive hazards model.
We propose a class of recursive instrumental variable estimators for these
exposure effects, and derive their large sample properties along with
inferential tools. We examine the performance of the proposed method in
simulation studies and illustrate it in a Mendelian randomization study to
evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and
Retirement Study. We further use the proposed method to investigate potential
benefit from breast cancer screening on subsequent breast cancer mortality

the effective radius scales with UV luminosity as $R_\mathrm{e}\propto
L^{0.25}$ at $z{\sim}5$--$9$. We show that recently discovered very luminous
galaxies at $z{\sim}7$ (Bowler et al. 2016) and $z{\sim}11$ (Oesch et al. 2016)
lie on our predicted size--luminosity relations. We find that a significant

the ability to resolve all galaxies in haloes above the atomic cooling limit.
We show that our fiducial model successfully reproduces the redshift evolution
of average galaxy sizes at $z>5$. We also explore galaxy sizes in models

sizes that are smaller than observations. We therefore confirm that supernova

used to determine the extent of the sheath and gain information about the

are advantageous because they are not only simple and quick to carry out, but
they also can be performed using standard dusty plasma experimental equipment.
In the first method, dust particles are tracked as they fall through the plasma
toward the lower electrode. These trajectories are then used to determine the
electric force on the particle as a function of height as well as the extent of
the sheath. In the second method, dust particle levitation height is measured

shown that the particles exhibiting a levitation height that is independent of
RF voltage indicate the sheath edge - the boundary between the quasineutral
bulk plasma and the sheath. Therefore, both of these simple and inexpensive,

the long precession coils by pairs of longitudinal neutron spin-echo coils

with small longitudinal guide fields that can in addition be used as field
subtraction coils thus allowing to adjust the field integrals over a range of 8
orders of magnitude. Therefore, the dynamic range of RESPECT can in principle
be varied over 8 orders of magnitude in time, if neutrons with the required

echo times of up to approximately 1 microsecond can be reached if the
divergence and the correction elements are properly adjusted. Thanks to the
optional use of neutron guides and the fact that the currents for the
correction coils are much smaller than in standard NSE, intensity gains of at

competitive for operation at medium flux neutron sources. RESPECT can also be
operated in a MIEZE configuration allowing the investigation of relaxation
processes in depolarizing environments as they occur when magnetic fields are

The He i 1083 nm is a powerful diagnostic for inferring properties

basic formation of the line in one-dimensional models is well understood, but
the influence of the complex 3D structure of the chromosphere and corona has
however never been investigated. This structure must play an essential role
because images taken in He i 1083 nm show structures with widths down to 100
km. Aims. To understand the effect of the three-dimensional temperature and
density structure in the solar atmosphere on the formation of the He i 1083 nm
line. Methods. We solve the non-LTE radiative transfer problem assuming
statistical equilibrium for a simple 9-level helium atom that nevertheless
captures all essential physics. As a model atmosphere we use a snapshot from a
3D radiation-MHD simulation computed with the Bifrost code. Ionising radiation
from the corona is self-consistently taken into account. Results. The emergent
intensity in the He i 1083 nm is set by the source function and the opacity in
the upper chromosphere. The former is dominated by scattering of photospheric
radiation and does not vary much with spatial location. The latter is
determined by the photonionisation rate in the He i ground state continuum, as
well as the electron density in the chromosphere. The spatial variation of the
flux of ionising radiation is caused by the spatially-structured emissivity of
the ionising photons from material at T = 100 kK in the transition region. The
hotter coronal material produces more ionising photons, but the resulting
radiation field is smooth and does not lead to small-scale variation of the UV
flux. The corrugation of the transition region further increases the spatial
variation of the amount of UV radiation in the chromosphere.

long time. In this work we establish a new kind of complimentary relations in
the frame work of quantum information processing tasks. In broadcasting of
entanglement we create many pairs of less entangled states from a given
entangled state both by local and non local cloning operations. These entangled
states can be used in various information processing tasks like teleportation
and superdense coding. Since these states are less entangled states it is quite
intuitive that these states are not going to be as powerful resource as the
initial states. In this work we study the usefulness of these states in tasks
like teleportation and super dense coding. More precisely, we found out bounds
of their capabilities in terms of several complimentary relations involving
fidelity of broadcasting. In principle we have considered general mixed as a
resource also separately providing different examples like a) Werner like
states, b) Bell diagonal states. Here we have used both local and non local
cloning operations as means of broadcasting. In the later part of our work, we
extend this result by obtaining bounds in form of complimentary relations in a

election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify the
complete election process. Finally, we incorporate trustees, who control result
production while guaranteeing privacy and end-to-end-verifiability as long as
their strong majority is honest.
  Our suite of e-voting systems are the first whose voting operation is human
verifiable, i.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack
is potentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured
her vote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election
auditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy.
  We provide a model and security analysis of the systems, implement complete
prototypes, measure their performance experimentally, and demonstrate their
ability to handle large-scale elections. Finally, we demonstrate the
performance trade-offs between the two versions of the system. A preliminary
version of our system was used to conduct exit-polls at three voting sites for
two national-level elections and is being adopted for use by the largest civil

images will often be adversarial for networks trained on disjoint subsets of

security risk as well as a serious machine learning challenge---it is clear
that vulnerable neural networks perceive images very differently from humans.
Noting that virtually every image classification data set is composed of JPG

adversarial images. For Fast-Gradient-Sign perturbations of small magnitude, we
found that JPG compression often reverses the drop in classification accuracy

capturing all substrings of a given text essentially by storing all its
suffixes in the lexicographical order. In some applications, we work with a
subset of $b$ interesting suffixes, which are stored in the so-called sparse
suffix tree. Because the size of this structure is $\Theta(b)$, it is natural
to seek a construction algorithm using only $O(b)$ words of space assuming
read-only random access to the text. We design a linear-time Monte Carlo
algorithm for this problem, hence resolving an open question explicitly stated
by Bille et al. [TALG 2016]. The best previously known algorithm by I et al.
[STACS 2014] works in $O(n\log b)$ time. Our solution proceeds in $n/b$ rounds;
in the $r$-th round, we consider all suffixes starting at positions congruent
to $r$ modulo $n/b$. By maintaining rolling hashes, we lexicographically sort
all interesting suffixes starting at such positions, and then we merge them
with the already considered suffixes. For efficient merging, we also need to
answer LCE queries in small space. By plugging in the structure of Bille et al.
[CPM 2015] we obtain $O(n+b\log b)$ time complexity. We improve this structure,
which implies a linear-time sparse suffix tree construction algorithm. We
complement our Monte Carlo algorithm with a deterministic verification
procedure. The verification takes $O(n\sqrt{\log b})$ time, which improves upon
the bound of $O(n\log b)$ obtained by I et al. [STACS 2014]. This is obtained
by first observing that the pruning done inside the previous solution has a
rather clean description using the notion of graph spanners with small
multiplicative stretch. Then, we are able to decrease the verification time by
applying difference covers twice. Combined with the Monte Carlo algorithm, this
gives us an $O(n\sqrt{\log b})$-time and $O(b)$-space Las Vegas algorithm.

  LaTeX",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an extension of Logic Programming (under stable models semantics)
that, not only allows concluding whether a true atom is a cause of another
atom, but also deriving new conclusions from these causal-effect relations.
This is expressive enough to capture informal rules like ""if some agent's
actions $\mathcal{A}$ have been necessary to cause an event $E$ then conclude
atom $caused(\mathcal{A},E)$,"" something that, to the best of our knowledge,
had not been formalised in the literature. To this aim, we start from a first
attempt that proposed extending the syntax of logic programs with so-called
causal literals. These causal literals are expressions that can be used in rule
bodies and allow inspecting the derivation of some atom $A$ in the program with
respect to some query function $\phi$. Depending on how these query functions
are defined, we can model different types of causal relations such as
sufficient, necessary or contributory causes, for instance. The initial
approach was specifically focused on monotonic query functions. This was enough
to cover sufficient cause-effect relations but, unfortunately, necessary and
contributory are essentially non-monotonic. In this work, we define a semantics
for non-monotonic causal literals showing that, not only extends the stable
model semantics for normal logic programs, but also preserves many of its usual
desirable properties for the extended syntax. Using this new semantics, we
provide precise definitions of necessary and contributory causal relations and
briefly explain their behaviour on a pair of typical examples from the
Knowledge Representation literature. (Under consideration for publication in

theory, has been remarkably found to manifest itself in several experimental
realizations as in the famous double-slit experiment. In this specific case, a
single particle seems to travel through two separated slits simultaneously.
Nevertheless, it is never possible to measure it in both slits, which naturally
appears as a manifestation of the collapse postulate. In this respect, one
could as well ask if it is possible to ""perceive"" the presence of the particle
at the two slits simultaneously, once its collapse could be avoided. In this
article, we use the recently proposed entanglement mediation protocol to
provide a positive answer to this question. It is shown that a photon which
behaves like a wave, i.e., which seems to be present in two distant locations
at the same time, can modify two existing physical realities in these
locations. Calculations of the ""weak trace"" left by such photon also enforce
the validity of the present argumentation.

an algebraic expression (in terms of rule labels) that represents its
justifications. As in our previous work for non-disjunctive programs, these
justifications are obtained in a purely semantic way, by algebraic operations
(product, addition and application) on a lattice of causal values. Our new
definition extends the concept of causal stable model to disjunctive logic
programs and satisfies that each (standard) stable model corresponds to a
disjoint class of causal stable models sharing the same truth assignments, but
possibly varying the obtained explanations. We provide a pair of illustrative
examples showing the behaviour of the new semantics and discuss the need of
introducing a new type of rule, which we call causal-choice. This type of rule
intuitively captures the idea of ""$A$ may cause $B$"" and, when causal
information is disregarded, amounts to a usual choice rule under the standard
stable model semantics. (Under consideration for publication in Theory and

These ATLAS searches substantially impact those models for which the mass
$m(\tilde{\chi}^0_1)$ of the lightest neutralino is less than 65 GeV, excluding
86% of such models. The searches have limited impact on models with larger

has become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the
like, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I
propose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the
most general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that
using programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is
agency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics
as economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to
implement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously
describe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational
cryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are
performed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can
execute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has
already been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility
from human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic
advantages over the current passive form of money. For example in
microeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,
ensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of
contracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example
the control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to
money. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external
human agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic
systems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,
thereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.

integrated SRAMs are evaluated by using Monte Carlo sumulation methods based on
Geant4. The cross sections of SEUs and Multi Cell Upsets (MCUs) for 3D SRAM are
simulated by using heavy ions with different energies and LETs. The results
show that the sensitivity of different die of 3D SRAM has obvious discrepancies
at low LET. Average percentage of MCUs of 3D SRAMs rises from 17.2% to 32.95%
when LET increases from 42.19 MeV cm2/mg to 58.57MeV cm2/mg. As for a certain
LET, the percentage of MCUs shows a notable distinction between face-to-face
structure and back-to-face structure. For back-to-face structure, the
percentage of MCUs increases with the deeper die. However, the face-to-face die
presents the relatively low percentage of MCUs. The comparison of SEU cross
sections for planar SRAMs and experiment data are conducted to indicate the
effectiveness of our simulation method. Finally, we compare the upset cross
sections of planar process and 3D integrated SRAMs. Results demonstrate that
the sensitivity of 3D SRAMs is not more than that of planar SRAMs and the 3D
structure can be become a great potential application for aerospace and
military domain.

properties of semiconductor materials, annihilation of such clusters is limited
by their lack of thermal mobility due to high migration barriers. Here, we find
that small clusters in bulk SiC (a covalent material of importance for both
electronic and nuclear applications) can become mobile at room temperature
under the influence of electron radiation. So far, direct observation of
radiation-induced diffusion of defect clusters in bulk materials has not been
demonstrated yet. This finding was made possible by low angle annular dark
field (LAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with
non-rigid registration technique to remove sample instability, which enables
atomic resolution imaging of small migrating defect clusters. We show that the
underlying mechanism of this athermal diffusion is ballistic collision between
incoming electrons and cluster atoms. Our findings suggest that defect clusters
may be mobile under certain irradiation conditions, changing current
understanding of cluster annealing process in irradiated covalent materials.

treatment of positions with approach moves but no ko revealed a class of
positions not described in the literature before.
  The complete presented classification is simpler and more compact than the
one used so far. This was achieved through a classification by the types of
liberties and the order they are to be filled instead of a classification by
group status.
  A principal difference to semeai without approach moves is that in the
presence of approach moves and shared liberties and the absence of eyes, two
different strategies are possible because the un-orthodox filling of shared
liberties instead of outer liberties may be a better strategy.

the balancing of empirical controllability and observability covariances that
are calculated around the operating region. Unlike existing model reduction
methods, the external system does not need to be linearized but is directly
dealt with as a nonlinear system. A transformation is found to balance the
controllability and observability covariances in order to determine which
states have the greatest contribution to the input-output behavior. The
original system model is then reduced by Galerkin projection based on this
transformation. The proposed method is tested and validated on a system
comprised of a 16-machine 68-bus system and an IEEE 50-machine 145-bus system.
The results show that by using the proposed model reduction the calculation
efficiency can be greatly improved; at the same time, the obtained state
trajectories are close to those for directly simulating the whole system or
partitioning the system while not performing reduction. Compared with the
balanced truncation method based on a linearized model, the proposed nonlinear
model reduction method can guarantee higher accuracy and similar calculation
efficiency. It is shown that the proposed method is not sensitive to the choice
of the matrices for calculating the empirical covariances.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The human action classification task is a widely researched topic and is
still an open problem. Many state-of-the-arts approaches involve the usage of
bag-of-video-words with spatio-temporal local features to construct
characterizations for human actions. In order to improve beyond this standard
approach, we investigate the usage of co-occurrences between local features. We
propose the usage of co-occurrences information to characterize human actions.
A trade-off factor is used to define an optimal trade-off between vocabulary
size and classification rate. Next, a spatio-temporal co-occurrence technique
is applied to extract co-occurrence information between labeled local features.
Novel characterizations for human actions are then constructed. These include a
vector quantized correlogram-elements vector, a highly discriminative PCA
(Principal Components Analysis) co-occurrence vector and a Haralick texture
vector. Multi-channel kernel SVM (support vector machine) is utilized for
classification. For evaluation, the well known KTH as well as the challenging
UCF-Sports action datasets are used. We obtained state-of-the-arts
classification performance. We also demonstrated that we are able to fully
utilize co-occurrence information, and improve the standard bag-of-video-words
approach.

multimedia services in beyond 3G wireless systems. The scheme is studied in the
context of the state-of-the-art 3.5G system i.e. the High Speed Downlink Packet
Access (HSDPA) which enhances 3G UMTS to support high-speed packet switched
services. Unlike earlier systems, UMTS-evolved systems from HSDPA and beyond
incorporate mechanisms such as packet scheduling and HARQ in the base station
necessitating data buffering at the air interface. This introduces a potential
bottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, buffer management at the air
interface is crucial for end-to-end QoS support of multimedia services with
multiplexed parallel diverse flows such as video and data in the same end-user
session. The dynamic buffer management scheme for HSDPA multimedia sessions
with aggregated real-time and non real-time flows is investigated via extensive
HSDPA simulations. The impact of the scheme on end-to-end traffic performance
is evaluated with an example multimedia session comprising a real-time
streaming flow concurrent with TCP-based non real-time flow. Results
demonstrate that the scheme can guarantee the end-to-end QoS of the real-time
streaming flow, whilst simultaneously protecting the non real-time flow from
starvation resulting in improved end-to-end throughput performance.

  Circles in a Circular Container","19 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper addresses the equal circle packing problem, and proposes an
efficient Quasi-physical Quasi-human (QPQH) algorithm. QPQH is based on a
modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm which we call the
local BFGS and a new basin hopping strategy based on a Chinese idiom: alternate
tension with relaxation. Starting from a random initial layout, we apply the
local BFGS algorithm to reach a local minimum layout. The local BFGS algorithm
fully utilizes the neighborhood information of each circle to considerably
speed up the running time of the gradient descent process, and the efficiency
is very apparent for large scale instances. When yielding a local minimum
layout, the new basin-hopping strategy is to shrink the container size to
different extent to generate several new layouts. Experimental results indicate
that the new basin-hopping strategy is very efficient, especially for a type of
layout with comparatively dense packing in the center and comparatively sparse
packing around the boundary of the container. We test QPQH on the instances of
n = 1,2,...,320, and obtain 66 new layouts which have smaller container sizes
than the current best-known results reported in literature.
