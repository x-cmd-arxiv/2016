crystals of the relaxor $KTa_{1-x}Nb_xO_3$ with x=0.15-0.17 was studied by
means of high resolution inelastic cold neutron scattering near the (200) B.Z.
point where diffuse scattering is absent, although it is present near (110). In
a wide range of temperatures centered on the phase transition, T=195K-108K, the
TA phonon width (damping) exhibits a step increase around momentum q=0.07, goes
through a shallow maximum at q=0.09-0.12 and remains high up to the highest
momentum studied of q=0.16. These experimental results are explained in terms
of a resonant interaction between the TA phonon and the collective or
correlated reorientation through tunneling of the off-center Nb+5 ions. The
observed TA damping is successfully reproduced in a simple model that includes
an interaction between the TA phonon and a dispersionless localized mode (LM)
with frequency $\omega_L$ and damping $\Gamma_L$ ($\Gamma_L < \omega_L$),
itself coupled to the transverse optic (TO) mode. Maximum damping of the TA
phonon occurs when its frequency $\omega_a \approx{\omega_L}$. $\omega_L$ and
$\Gamma_L$ are moderately dependent on temperature but the oscillator strength,
$M_2$, of the resonant damping exhibits a strong maximum in the range
$T\sim{150 K-120 K}$ in which neutron diffuse scattering near the (110) B.Z.
point is also maximum and the dielectric susceptibility exhibits the relaxor
behavior. The maximum value of M appears to be due to the increasing number of
polar nanodomains. In support of the proposed model, the observed value of
$\omega_L$ is found to be similar to the estimate previously obtained by
Girshberg and Yacoby. Alternatively, the TA phonon damping can be successfully
fitted in the framework of an empirical Havriliak - Negami (HN) relaxation
model that includes a strong resonance-like transient contribution.

response functions of the Hubbard model using the high-temperature series
expansion. We consider generic dimension $d$ as well as the infinite-$d$ limit,
arbitrary electron density $n$, and both finite and infinite repulsion $U$. We
use moment-reconstruction methods to obtain the one-electron spectral function,
the self-energy, and the optical conductivity. They are all smooth functions at
high-temperature and, at large-$U$, they are featureless with characteristic
widths of order the lattice hopping parameter $t$. In the infinite-$d$ limit we
compare the series expansion results with accurate numerical renormalization
group and interaction expansion quantum Monte-Carlo results. We find excellent
agreement down to surprisingly low temperatures, throughout most of the
bad-metal regime which applies for $T \gtrsim (1-n)D$, the Brinkman-Rice scale.
The resistivity increases linearly in $T$ at high-temperature without
saturation. This results from the $1/T$ behaviour of the compressibility or
kinetic energy, which play the role of the effective carrier number. In
contrast, the scattering time (or diffusion constant) saturate at high-$T$. We
find that $\sigma(n,T) \approx (1-n)\sigma(n=0,T)$ to a very good approximation
for all $n$, with $\sigma(n=0,T)\propto t/T$ at high temperatures. The
saturation at small $n$ occurs due to a compensation between the
density-dependence of the effective number of carriers and that of the
scattering time. The $T$-dependence of the resistivity displays a knee-like
feature which signals a cross-over to the intermediate-temperature regime where
the diffusion constant (or scattering time) start increasing with decreasing
$T$. At high-temperatures, the thermopower obeys the Heikes formula, while the
Wiedemann-Franz law is violated with the Lorenz number vanishing as $1/T^2$.

contact. When contact is expected but does not occur or when contact is not

This paper describes an approach that uses simulation to detect possible such
behavioral divergences on real robots. This approach, and others like it, could
be applied to validation of robot behaviors, mechanism design, and even online
planning.
  The particle trace approach samples robot modeling parameters, sensory
readings, and state estimates to evaluate a robot's behavior statistically over
a range of conditions. We demonstrate that combining even coarse estimates of
state and modeling parameters with fast multibody simulation can be sufficient
to detect divergent robot behavior and characterize robot performance in the
real world. Correspondingly, this approach could be used to assess risk and
find and analyze likely failures, given the extensive data that such
simulations can generate.
  We assess this approach on actuated, high degree-of-freedom robot locomotion
examples, a picking task with a fixed-base manipulator, and an unpowered
passive dynamic walker. This research works toward understanding how
multi-rigid body simulations can better characterize the behavior of robots

of a previously disproved conjecture which stated that any Gorenstein lattice
polytope has a unimodal $h^\ast$-polynomial. The first counterexamples to
unimodality for Gorenstein lattice polytopes were given in even dimensions
greater than five by Musta{\c{t}}{\v{a}} and Payne, and this was extended to
all dimensions greater than five by Payne. While there exist numerous examples
in support of the conjecture that IDP reflexives are $h^\ast$-unimodal, its
validity has not yet been considered for families of reflexive lattice
simplices that closely generalize Payne's counterexamples. The main purpose of
this work is to prove that the former conjecture does indeed hold for a natural
generalization of Payne's examples. The second purpose of this work is to
extend this investigation to a broader class of lattice simplices, for which we
present new results and open problems.

Since mechanosensory cells in connective tissue are surrounded by a disordered

heterogeneous. Here, we investigate how this heterogeneity impacts
mechanosensing by modeling the cell as an idealized local stiffness sensor
inside a disordered fiber network. For all types of networks we study,
including experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin architectures, we find that
measurements applied at different points throughout a given network yield a
strikingly broad range of local stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades. We
verify via simulations and scaling arguments that this broad range of local
stiffnesses is a generic property of disordered fiber networks, and show that
the range can be further increased by tuning specific network features,
including the presence of long fibers and the proximity to elastic transitions.
These features additionally allow for a highly tunable dependence of stiffness
on probe length. Finally, we show that to obtain optimal, reliable estimates of
global tissue stiffness, a cell must adjust its size, shape, and position to
integrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.

Alternatively, open-ended laboratory activities can provide a more authentic

cognitive radio networks. Typical routing protocols avoid areas that are highly
congested with primary users, leaving only a small fragment of available links
for secondary route construction. In addition, wireless links are prone to
channel impairments such as multipath fading; which renders the quality of the
available links highly fluctuating. In this paper, we investigate using
cooperative communication mechanisms to reveal new routing opportunities,
enhance route qualities, and enable true coexistence of primary and secondary
networks. As a result, we propose Undercover: a cooperative routing protocol
that utilizes the available location information to assist in the routing
process. Specifically, our protocol revisits a fundamental assumption taken by
the state of the art routing protocols designed for cognitive radio networks.
Using Undercover, secondary users can transmit in the regions of primary users
activity through utilizing cooperative communication techniques to null out
transmission at primary receivers via beamforming. In addition, the secondary
links qualities are enhanced using cooperative diversity. To account for the
excessive levels of interference typically incurred due to cooperative
transmissions, we allow our protocol to be interference-aware. Thus,
cooperative transmissions are penalized in accordance to the amount of
negatively affected secondary flows. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed protocol via NS2 simulations which show that our protocol can enhance
the network goodput by a ratio reaches up to 250% compared to other popular
cognitive routing protocols with minimal added overhead.

Torus Mapper code (TM) behaves in regions of phase space in which orbits are
resonantly trapped, and we extend TM so trapped orbits can be manipulated as

velocity space depends on the weights assigned to trapped orbits. The impact is
everywhere small if each trapped orbit is assigned the phase space density

quantum field theory. A few of its remarkable features are conformal symmetry
at the quantum level, evidence of integrability and, moreover, it is a prime
example of the AdS/CFT duality. Triggered by Witten's twistor string theory,
the past 15 years have witnessed enormous progress in reformulating this theory
to make as many of these special features manifest, from the choice of
convenient variables to recursion relations that allowed new mathematical
structures to appear, like the Grassmannian. These methods are collectively
referred to as on-shell methods. The ultimate hope is that, by understanding
N=4 SYM in depth, one can learn about other, more realistic quantum field
theories. The overarching theme of this thesis is the investigation of how
on-shell methods can aid the computation of quantities other than scattering
amplitudes. In this spirit we study form factors and correlation functions,
said to be partially and completely off-shell quantities, respectively. More
explicitly, we compute form factors of half-BPS operators up to two loops, and
study the dilatation operator in the SO(6) and SU(2|3) sectors using techniques
originally designed for amplitudes. A second part of the work is dedicated to
the study of scattering amplitudes beyond the planar limit, an area of research
which is still in its infancy, and not much is known about which special
features of the planar theory survive in the non-planar regime. In this

$m_3$ is the mass of a $^3$He atom. These negative ions have proven to be
powerful local probes of the physical properties of the host quantum fluid,

for the forces on moving electron bubbles in superfluid $^3$He-A (Shevtsov et

types. The items wait in queues -- one per each item type -- until they are
""matched."" Each matching requires certain quantities of items of different
types; after a matching is activated, the associated items leave the system.
There exists a finite set of possible matchings, each producing a certain
amount of ""reward"". This model has a broad range of important applications,
including assemble-to-order systems, Internet advertising, matching web
portals, etc.
  We propose an optimal matching scheme in the sense that it asymptotically
maximizes the long-term average matching reward, while keeping the queues
stable. The scheme makes matching decisions in a specially constructed virtual
system, which in turn control decisions in the physical system. The key feature
of the virtual system is that, unlike the physical one, it allows the queues to
become negative. The matchings in the virtual system are controlled by an
extended version of the greedy primal-dual (GPD) algorithm, which we prove to
be asymptotically optimal -- this in turn implies the asymptotic optimality of
the entire scheme. The scheme is real-time, at any time it uses simple rules
based on the current state of virtual and physical queues. It is very robust in
that it does not require any knowledge of the item arrival rates, and
automatically adapts to changing rates.
  The extended GPD algorithm and its asymptotic optimality apply to a quite
general queueing network framework, not limited to matching problems, and
therefore is of independent interest.

To start with, we first create a candid-images-for-facial-expression (CIFE)

CNN model for web image expression classification. In order to increase the
expression recognition accuracy, we also fine-tune the CNN model and thus
obtain a better CNN facial expression recognition model. Based on the
fine-tuned CNN model, we design a facial expression game engine and collect a
new and more balanced dataset, GaMo. The images of this dataset are collected
from the different expressions our game users make when playing the game.
Finally, we evaluate the GaMo and CIFE datasets and show that our recursive
framework can help build a better facial expression model for dealing with real

techniques of Bhargava and Hanke, we answer this question for quaternary forms.
In the process, we prove what Halmos could not; namely, that
$x^2+2y^2+7z^2+13w^2$ represents all positive integers except $5$. We develop
new strategies to handle forms of higher dimensions, yielding an enumeration of
and proofs for the $73$ possible pairs that a classically integral positive
definite quadratic form may except.

of liquid crystal textures. The response of the liquid crystal to competing
surface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the
anisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths
scales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters.
Transitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may
occur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy
to investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel
anchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular
(hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a
non-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel,
which is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the
elastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect
is a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into
a zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant
becomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The
transition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to
rotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically
favourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid
crystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate
in detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the
geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the
experimental results is found to be non-linear.

experiment is examined in the framework of a model in which the neutrino is
described by a wave packet with a relative intrinsic momentum dispersion
$\sigma_\text{rel}$. Three pairs of nuclear reactors and eight antineutrino
detectors, each with good energy resolution, distributed among three
experimental halls, supply a high-statistics sample of $\bar{\nu}_e$ acquired
at nine different baselines. This provides a unique platform to test the
effects which arise from the wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillation. The
modified survival probability formula was used to fit Daya Bay data, providing
the first experimental limits: $2.38 \cdot 10^{-17} < \sigma_{\rm rel} < 0.23$.
Treating the dimensions of the reactor cores and detectors as constraints, the
limits are improved: $10^{-14} \lesssim \sigma_{\rm rel} < 0.23$, and an upper
limit of $\sigma_{\rm rel} <0.20$ is obtained. All limits correspond to a 95\%
C.L. Furthermore, the effect due to the wave packet nature of neutrino
oscillation is found to be insignificant for reactor antineutrinos detected by
the Daya Bay experiment thus ensuring an unbiased measurement of the
oscillation parameters $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$ within the

sufficiently weak integrability-breaking interactions we always observe
prethermalization plateaux, where local observables relax to non-thermal values

analyze in some detail the spreading of correlations and in particular the

feature and other similarities led to ask whether there is a duality between
these two independent proposals. In the absence of curvature and comparing the
symmetries of both position and momentum space, we show that $\kappa$-Minkowski

describe certain aspects of $\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a
multifractional theory and vice versa. Contrary to previous literature, this
result holds without assuming any specific measure for $\kappa$-Minkowski. More
generally, no well-defined $\star$-product can be constructed from the
$q$-theory, although the latter does admit a natural noncommutative extension
with a given deformed Poincar\'e algebra. A similar no-go theorem may be valid
for all multiscale theories with factorizable measures. Turning gravity on, we

This chapter introduces a biologically inspired algorithm, called the Self
Organising Map (SOM), that was developed by Teuvo Kohonen in 1981. Since the
algorithm's inception it has been scrutinised by the scientific community and
analysed in more than 4000 research papers, many of which dealt with various
computer security issues, from anomaly detection, analysis of executables all
the way to wireless network monitoring. In this chapter a review of security
related SOM research undertaken in the past is presented and analysed. The
algorithm's biological analogies are detailed and the author's view on the
future possibilities of this successful bio-inspired approach are given. The
SOM algorithm's close relation to a number of vital functions of the human
brain and the emergence of multi-core computer architectures are the two main
reasons behind our assumption that the future of the SOM algorithm and its
variations is promising, notably in the field of computer security.

and kinematics of ionized gas in star-forming galaxies on sub-kiloparsec
physical scales. We observe elevated velocity dispersions (sigma > 50 km/s)
seen in z > 1.5 galaxies persist at z~1 in the integrated galaxies. Using an
inclined disk model and the ratio of v/sigma, we find that 1/3 of the z~1
sample are disk candidates while the other 2/3 of the sample are dominated by
merger-like and irregular sources. We find that including extra attenuation
towards HII regions derived from stellar population synthesis modeling brings
star formation rates (SFR) using Ha and stellar population fit into a better
agreement. We explore properties of compact Ha sub-component, or ""clump,"" at
z~1 and find that they follow a similar size-luminosity relation as local HII
regions but are scaled-up by an order of magnitude with higher luminosities and
sizes. Comparing the z~1 clumps to other high-redshift clump studies, we
determine that the clump SFR surface density evolves as a function of redshift.
This may imply clump formation is directly related to the gas fraction in these
systems and support disk fragmentation as their formation mechanism since gas
fraction scales with redshift.

difficult to measure. In this work we present the first directly measured
circular velocity function that is representative between 60 < v_circ < 320
km/s for galaxies of all morphological types at a given rotation velocity. For
the low mass galaxy population (60 < v_circ < 170 km/s), we use the HIPASS
velocity function. For the massive galaxy population (170 < v_circ < 320 km/s),
we use stellar circular velocities from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field
Area Survey (CALIFA). In earlier work we obtained the measurements of circular
velocity at the 80% light radius for 226 galaxies and demonstrated that the
CALIFA sample can produce volume- corrected galaxy distribution functions. The
CALIFA velocity function includes homogeneous velocity measurements of both
late and early-type rotation-supported galaxies and has the crucial advantage
of not missing gas-poor massive ellipticals that HI surveys are blind to. We
show that both velocity functions can be combined in a seamless manner, as
their ranges of validity overlap. The resulting observed velocity function is
compared to velocity functions derived from cosmological simulations of the z =
0 galaxy population. We find that dark matter-only simulations show a strong
mismatch with the observed VF. Hydrodynamic simulations fare better, but still

presence of a population of Li-rich red clump (RC) stars. One proposed
explanation for this population is that all stars with masses near 2 $M_\odot$
experience a short-lived phase of Li-richness at the onset of core He-burning.
Many of these stars have low 12C/13C, a signature of deep mixing that is
presumably associated with the Li regeneration. To test this purported
mechanism of Li enrichment, we measured abundances in 38 RC stars and 6 red
giant branch (RGB) stars in four open clusters selected to have RC masses near
2 $M_\odot$. We find six Li-rich stars (A(Li) > 1.50 dex) of which only two may
be RC stars. None of the RC stars have Li exceeding the levels observed in the
RGB stars, but given the brevity of the suggested Li-rich phase and the modest
sample size, it is probable that stars with larger Li-enrichments were missed
simply by chance. However, we find very few stars in our sample with low
12C/13C. Such low 12C/13C, seen in many field Li-rich stars, should persist
even after lithium has returned to normal low levels. Thus, if Li synthesis
during the He flash occurs, it is a rare, but potentially long-lived occurrence
rather than a short-lived phase for all stars. We estimate a conservative upper
limit of the fraction of stars going through a Li-rich phase to be <47\%, based
on stars that have low 12C/13C for their observed A(Li).

cosmological event which is known as the little sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR).
We classify the interactions which can possibly avoid this late-time abrupt

the interaction between DM and DE energy densities at present as indicated by
recent studies based on BAO and SDSS data. In the later stage, we
observationally distinguish those interactions using the statefinder hierarchy

those interactions by measuring their departures from the concordance model. In

On-Instrument Wavefront Sensor systems being developed at NRC Herzberg. IRIS is
suspended from the bottom port of the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics
System (NFIRAOS), and provides its own image de-rotation to compensate for
sidereal rotation of the focal plane. This arrangement is a challenge because
NFIRAOS is designed to host two other science instruments, which imposes strict
mass requirements on IRIS. We have been tasked with keeping the instrument mass
under seven tonnes which has resulted in a mass reduction of 30 percent for the
support structure and rotator compared to the most recent IRIS designs. To
accomplish this goal, while still being able to withstand earthquakes, we
developed a new design with composite materials. As IRIS is a client instrument
of NFIRAOS, it benefits from NFIRAOS's superior AO correction. IRIS assists
this correction by sensing low-order aberrations with an On-Instrument
Wavefront Sensor (OIWFS). The OIWFS consists of three independently positioned
natural guide star wavefront sensors that patrol a 2-arcminute field of view.
We expect tip-tilt measurements from faint stars within the IRIS imager focal
plane will further stabilize the delivered image quality. We describe how the
use of On-Detector Guide Windows (ODGWs) in the IRIS imager can be incorporated

tracking sources with this complex AO system, and for mitigating and measuring
the various potential sources of image blur and misalignment due to properties

in a superposition of causal orders - without destroying the coherence - to
acquire information both inside and outside of a 'causally non-ordered

demonstrating by almost seven standard deviations that the experimentally

instruments simultaneously observed proton intensities for the period between
July 2006 and June 2009. Radial and latitudinal gradients are calculated from
measurements, with the latter possible because Ulysses changed its position
significantly in the heliocentric meridional plane during this period. The
modulation model is set up for the conditions that prevailed during this
unusual solar minimum period to gain insight into the role role that particle
drifts played in establishing the observed gradients for this period. Four
year-end PAMELA proton spectra were reproduced with the model, from 2006 to
2009, followed by corresponding radial profiles that were computed along the
Voyager-1 trajectory, and compared to available observations. It is found that
the computed intensity levels are in agreement with solar minimum observations
from Voyager-1 at multiple energies. The model also reproduces the steep
intensity increase observed when Voyager-1 crossed the heliopause region. Good
agreement is found between computed and observed latitudinal gradients so that
we conclude that the model gives a most reasonable representation of modulation
conditions from the Earth to the heliopause for the period from 2006 to 2009.
As a characteristic feature of CR drifts, the most negative latitudinal
gradient is computed for 2009, with a value of -0.15%/degree around 600 MV. The

  Our main contribution is in providing tools for derandomizing solutions to
local problems, when the $n$ nodes can only send $O(\log n)$-bit messages in
each round of communication. We combine bounded independence, which we show to
be sufficient for some algorithms, with the method of conditional expectations

graph, in $O(D\log^2 n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. The
best known running time in terms of $n$ alone is $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$, which
is super-polylogarithmic, and requires large messages. For the CONGEST model,
the only known previous solution is a coloring-based $O(\Delta + \log^*

  On the way to obtaining the above, we show that in the \emph{Congested
Clique} model, which allows all-to-all communication, there is a deterministic
MIS algorithm that runs in $O(\log \Delta \log n)$ rounds.%, where $\Delta$ is

$O(kn^{1+1/k}\log n)$ edges in $O(k \log n)$ rounds. For comparison, in the

the following question: ""Are there distinct thick and thin disks?"". The answer
to this question depends on the definition one adopts for thin and thick disks.
The participants of this discussion converged to the idea that there are at
least two different types of disks in the Milky Way. However, there are still
important open questions on how to best define these two types of disks
(chemically, kinematically, geometrically or by age?). The question of what is
the origin of the distinct disks remains open. The future Galactic surveys
which are highlighted in this conference should help us answering these

representing different modelling approaches (Galactic models such as TRILEGAL,
Besancon and Galaxia, chemical evolution models, extended distribution

$\sigma$ specifies the client assignments, such that $|S|\leq k$,
$|\sigma^{-1}(i)|\geq L_i$ for all $i\in S$, and
$|\sigma^{-1}(\mathsf{out})|\leq m$. In the {\em lower-bounded min-sum-of-radii

  We obtain an approximation factor of $12.365$ for \lbksro, which improves to
$3.83$ for the non-outlier version (i.e., $m=0$). These also constitute the
{\em first} approximation bounds for the min-sum-of-radii objective when we

chief technical contribution and novelty of our algorithm is that, departing
from the standard paradigm used for such constrained problems, we obtain an
$O(1)$-approximation {\em despite the fact that we do not obtain a
Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving algorithm for the Lagrangian relaxation}. We
believe that our ideas have {broader applicability to other clustering problems

We find that the free ion effect is correlated with the water density
fluctuation near a non-polar molecular surface, showing that such fluctuation

hydrophobic interactions can be switched on and off by choosing different
spatial arrangements of proximal ions on a nano-rod. For globally amphiphilic
nano-rods, we find that the magnitude of the interaction can be further tuned
using proximal ions with varying ionic sizes. In general, univalent proximal
anions are found to weaken hydrophobic interactions. This is in contrast to the
effect of free ions, which according to our simulations strengthen hydrophobic
interactions. In addition, immobilized anions of increasing ionic size do not
follow the same ordering (Hofmeister-like ranking) as free ions when it comes
to their impact on hydrophobic interactions. The immobilized ion effect is not
simply correlated with the water density fluctuation near the non-polar side of

Hopefully, a stable version",,,,"cs.FL cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Specifications of complex, large scale, computer software and hardware
systems can be radically simplified by using simple maps from input sequences
to output values. These ""state machine maps"" provide an alternative
representation of classical Moore type state machines. Composition of state
machine maps corresponds to state machine products and can be used to specify
essentially any type of interconnection as well as parallel and distributed
computation. State machine maps can also specify abstract properties of systems
and are significantly more concise and scalable than traditional
representations of automata. Examples included here include specifications of
producer/consumer software, network distributed consensus, real-time digital
circuits, and operating system scheduling. The motivation for this work comes
from experience designing and developing operating systems and real-time
software where weak methods for understanding and exploring designs is a well
known handicap. The methods introduced here are based on ordinary discrete
mathematics, primitive recursive functions and deterministic state machines and
are intended, initially, to aid the intuition and understanding of the system
developers. Staying strictly within the boundaries of classical deterministic
state machines anchors the methods to the algebraic structures of automata and
semigroups, obviates any need for axiomatic deduction systems, ""formal
methods"", or extensions to the model, and makes the specifications more
faithful to engineering practice. While state machine maps are obvious
representations of state machines, the techniques introduced here for defining
and composing them are novel. To illustrate applications, the paper includes a
fairly detailed specification and verification of the well-known ""Paxos""

arises in regularized empirical risk minimization in machine learning and
distributed constrained optimization in wireless sensor networks and smart

aggregated gradient (PIAG) method, which at each iteration moves along an
aggregated gradient (formed by incrementally updating gradients of component
functions according to a deterministic order) and taking a proximal step with
respect to the non-smooth function. While the convergence properties of this
method with randomized orders (in updating gradients of component functions)
have been investigated, this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
study that establishes the convergence rate properties of the PIAG method for
any deterministic order. In particular, we show that the PIAG algorithm is
globally convergent with a linear rate provided that the step size is
sufficiently small. We explicitly identify the rate of convergence and the
corresponding step size to achieve this convergence rate. Our results improve
upon the best known condition number dependence of the convergence rate of the
incremental aggregated gradient methods used for minimizing a sum of smooth

variabilities, which may be a direct reflection of the unsteady central engine.
We perform a series of axisymmetric 2.5-dimensional simulations to study the
propagation of relativistic, hydrodynamic, intermittent jets through the
envelope of a GRB progenitor star. A realistic rapidly rotating star is
incorporated as the background of jet propagation, and the star is allowed to
collapse due to the gravity of the central black hole. By modeling the
intermittent jets with constant-luminosity pulses with equal on and off
durations, we investigate how the half-period, $T$, affects the jet dynamics.
For relatively small $T$ values (e.g. 0.2 s), the jet breakout time $t_{\rm
bo}$ depends on the opening angle of the jet, with narrower jets more
penetrating and reaching the surface at shorter times. For $T \leq 1$ s, the
reverse shock crosses each pulse before the jet penetrates through the stellar
envelope. As a result, after the breakout of the first group of pulses at
$t_{\rm bo}$, several subsequent pulses vanish before penetrating the star,
causing a quiescent gap. For larger half-periods ($T=2.0, 4.0$ s), all the
pulses can successfully penetrate through the envelope, since each pulse can
propagate through the star before the reverse shock crosses the shell. Our
results may interpret the existence of a weak precursor in many long GRBs,
given that the GRB central engine injects intermittent pulses with half-period
$T \leq 1$ s. The observational data seem to be consistent with such a
possibility.

includes their distance from the focal city to be connected. This repeats until
all the cities are connected into a single loop. The time complexity of the

function of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of
external humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the

are humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This
simple model achieves excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination

{\alpha}-fault-tolerant k-center, where centers have a limit on the number of

intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), currently in operations at the
Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), Caltech. We coin this system
the IPAC/iPTF Discovery Engine (or IDE). We review the algorithms used for
PSF-matching, image subtraction, detection, photometry, and machine-learned
(ML) vetting of extracted transient candidates. We also review the performance
of our ML classifier. For a limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in relatively
unconfused regions, ""bogus"" candidates from processing artifacts and imperfect
image subtractions outnumber real transients by ~ 10:1. This can be
considerably higher for image data with inaccurate astrometric and/or
PSF-matching solutions. Despite this occasionally high contamination rate, the
ML classifier is able to identify real transients with an efficiency (or
completeness) of ~ 97% for a maximum tolerable false-positive rate of 1% when
classifying raw candidates. All subtraction-image metrics, source features, ML
probability-based real-bogus scores, contextual metadata from other surveys,
and possible associations with known Solar System objects are stored in a
relational database for retrieval by the various science working groups. We
review our efforts in mitigating false-positives and our experience in
optimizing the overall system in response to the multitude of science projects
underway with iPTF.

  Expectation-Maximization Algorithm",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative computational
method to calculate the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) from the sample
data. It converts a complicated one-time calculation for the MLE of the
incomplete data to a series of relatively simple calculations for the MLEs of
the complete data. When the MLE is available, we naturally want the Fisher
information matrix (FIM) of unknown parameters. The FIM is, in fact, a good
measure of the amount of information a sample of data provides and can be used
to determine the lower bound of the variance and the asymptotic variance of the
estimators. However, one of the limitations of the EM is that the FIM is not an
automatic by-product of the algorithm. In this paper, we review some basic
ideas of the EM and the FIM. Then we construct a simple Monte Carlo-based
method requiring only the gradient values of the function we obtain from the E
step and basic operations. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and
numerical examples to show the efficiency of our method. The key part of our
method is to utilize the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation
method to approximate the Hessian matrix from the gradient of the conditional
expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function. Key words: Fisher

over various alphabets. For any network, the following are equivalent: (i)
vector linear solvability over some finite field, (ii) scalar linear
solvability over some ring, (iii) linear solvability over some module.
Analogously, the following are equivalent: (a) scalar linear solvability over
some finite field, (b) scalar linear solvability over some commutative ring,
(c) linear solvability over some module whose ring is commutative. Whenever any
network is linearly solvable over a module, a smallest such module arises in a
vector linear solution for that network over a field.
  If a network is linearly solvable over some non-commutative ring but not over
any commutative ring, then such a non-commutative ring must have size at least
$16$, and for some networks, this bound is achieved. An infinite family of
networks is demonstrated, each of which is scalar linearly solvable over some
non-commutative ring but not over any commutative ring.
  Whenever $p$ is prime and $2 \le k \le 6$, if a network is scalar linearly
solvable over some ring of size $p^k$, then it is also $k$-dimensional vector

solvable networks over any given ring are also scalar linearly solvable over
any higher-ordered ring. As consequences, if a network has a scalar linear
solution over some finite commutative ring, then (i) the network is also scalar
linearly solvable over a maximal commutative ring of the same size, and (ii)
the (unique) smallest size commutative ring over which the network has a scalar
linear solution is a field. We prove that a commutative ring is maximal with
respect to the quasi-order if and only if some network is scalar linearly
solvable over the ring but not over any other commutative ring of the same
size. Furthermore, we show that maximal commutative rings are direct products
of certain fields specified by the integer partitions of the prime factor
multiplicities of the maximal ring's size.
  Finally, we prove that there is a unique maximal commutative ring of size $m$
if and only if each prime factor of $m$ has multiplicity in $\{1,2,3,4,6\}$. In
fact, whenever $p$ is prime and $k \in \{1,2,3,4,6\}$, the unique such maximal
ring of size $p^k$ is the field $GF(p^k)$. However, for every field $GF(p^k)$
with $k\not\in \{1,2,3,4,6\}$, there is always some network that is not scalar
linearly solvable over the field but is scalar linearly solvable over a
commutative ring of the same size. These results imply that for scalar linear
network coding over commutative rings, fields can always be used when the
alphabet size is flexible, but alternative rings may be needed when the
alphabet size is fixed.

dissimilarity measure or distance between two Hidden Markov Models with state
conditional distributions being Gaussian. For such HMMs, the marginal
distribution at any time spot follows a Gaussian mixture distribution, a fact
exploited to softly match, aka register, the states in two HMMs. We refer to
such HMMs as Gaussian mixture model-HMM (GMM-HMM). The registration of states
is inspired by the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the
Wasserstein metric between distributions. Specifically, the components of the
marginal GMMs are matched by solving an optimal transport problem where the
cost between components is the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions.
The solution of the optimization problem is a fast approximation to the
Wasserstein metric between two GMMs. The new Aggregated Wasserstein distance is
a semi-metric and can be computed without generating Monte Carlo samples. It is
invariant to relabeling or permutation of the states. This distance quantifies
the dissimilarity of GMM-HMMs by measuring both the difference between the two
marginal GMMs and the difference between the two transition matrices. Our new
distance is tested on the tasks of retrieval and classification of time series.
Experiments on both synthetic data and real data have demonstrated its
advantages in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency in comparison with
existing distances based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

pre-processing in marking duplicate reads on a single node system by 156-186x
compared with de facto standard tools. The sam2bam consists of parallel
software components that can fully utilize the multiple processors, available
memory, high-bandwidth of storage, and hardware compression accelerators if
available.
  The sam2bam provides file format conversion between well-known genome file
formats, from SAM to BAM, as a basic feature. Additional features such as
analyzing, filtering, and converting the input data are provided by {\it
plug-in} tools, e.g., duplicate marking, which can be attached to sam2bam at
runtime.
  We demonstrated that sam2bam could significantly reduce the runtime of NGS
data pre-processing from about two hours to about one minute for a whole-exome
data set on a 16-core single-node system using up to 130 GB of memory. The
sam2bam could reduce the runtime for whole-genome sequencing data from about 20
hours to about nine minutes on the same system using up to 711 GB of memory.

biological molecules, antimatters, non-collinear spin structures, and magnetic
skyrmions. The chirality in magnetic materials is often caused by the
noncollinear exchange interaction, called the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI). The DMI produces topological spin alignments such as the magnetic
skyrmions and chiral domain walls (DWs). In the chiral DWs, the DMI generates
an effective magnetic field $H_{DMI}$, resulting in a peculiar DW speed
variation in the DW creep regime. However, the role of $H_{DMI}$ over the
different DW-dynamics regimes remains elusive, particularly due to recent
observation of distinct behaviors between the creep and flow regimes. We hereby
demonstrate experimentally that the role of $H_{DMI}$ is invariant over the
creep and flow regimes. In the experiments, the pure DMI effect is quantified
by decomposing the symmetric and antisymmetric contributions of the DW motion.
The results manifest that the antisymmetric contribution vanishes gradually
across the creep and flow regimes, revealing that the symmetric contribution
from $H_{DMI}$ is unchanged. Though the DW dynamics is governed by distinct
mechanisms, the present observation demonstrates the uniqueness of the DMI
effect on the DWs over the creep and flow regimes.

understanding of the architectural properties of the currently observed
transiting systems is refined, based on Bayesian analysis and a series of
hypothesis tests. We find 1) it is not a selection bias that the innermost
planets reside near the stability limit for eight of the nine observed systems,
and this is consistent with a log uniform distribution of the planetary
semi-major axis; 2) it is not a selection bias that the planetary and stellar
orbits are nearly coplanar ($\lesssim 3^\circ$), and this together with
previous studies may imply an occurrence rate of circumbinary planets similar
to that of single star systems; 3) the dominance of observed circumbinary
systems with only one transiting planet may be caused by selection effects; 4)
formation mechanisms involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which may produce
misalignment and large separation between planet and stellar binaries, are
consistent with the lack of transiting circumbinary planets around short-period
stellar binaries, in agreement with previous studies. As a consequence of 4),
eclipse timing variations may better suit the detection of planets in such

identified. One plausible site is neutron star mergers (NSMs), but from
perspective of the Galactic chemical evolution, it has been pointed out that
NSMs cannot reproduce the observed r-process abundance distribution of
metal-poor stars at [Fe/H] $< -3$. Recently, Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014)
pointed out that NSM ejecta can spread into much larger volume than ejecta from
a supernova. We re-examine the enrichment of r-process elements by NSMs
considering this difference in propagation using the chemical evolution model
under the hierarchical galaxy formation. The observed r-process enhanced stars
around [Fe/H] $\sim -3$ are reproduced if the star formation efficiency is
lower for low-mass galaxies under a realistic delay time distribution for NSMs.
We show that a significant fraction of NSM ejecta escape from its host
proto-galaxy to pollute intergalactic matter and other proto-galaxies. The
propagation of r-process elements over proto-galaxies changes the abundance
distribution at [Fe/H] $< -3$ and obtains distribution compatible with
observations of the Milky Way halo stars. In particular, the pre-enrichment of
intergalactic medium explains the observed scarcity of EMP stars without Ba and
abundance distribution of r-process elements at [Fe/H] $\lesssim -3.5$.

precursor and/or exotic orders, called the pseudogap state, arises prior to a
superconducting condensate in underdoped cuprates that are situated near Mott

variation of bandwidth or correlation strength, which gives a new dimension to
exploring this exotic state. Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
studies on layered organic superconductors with half-filled bands whose widths
are pressure-tuned near the Mott transition. The system situated on the verge
of the Mott transition shows a pseudogap-like anomalous suppression of spin
excitations on cooling from well above the superconducting critical temperature
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$. The pressure variation of the NMR relaxation rate shows that
the pseudogap-like behavior is rapidly suppressed by applying pressure. The NMR
experiments under various magnetic fields varied up to 18 T proves the absence
of symmetry breaking orders that compete with superconductivity, such as charge
orders, in the metallic phase. Remarkably, the pseudogap-like behavior above
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the superconducting condensate fade out in parallel under
ascending magnetic fields with similar field-orientation dependence, indicating
a superconducting precursor is the predominant origin of the pseudogap. Our
further investigation of different materials, which take different ""distances""
from the Mott transition by chemical pressure, confirms that the
superconducting precursor is not the conventional amplitude fluctuations
arising from low dimensionality but unconventional preformation of Cooper pairs
enhanced near the Mott transition. These findings conclude that preformed
Cooper pairs persist up to twice as high as $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ on the verge of

clustering methods are based on the idea of expressing each data point as a
linear combination of other data points while regularizing the matrix of
coefficients with L1, L2 or nuclear norms for a sparse solution. L1
regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e.,
there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad
theoretical conditions, but the clusters may not be fully connected. L2 and
nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity, but give a
subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces. Mixed L1, L2 and
nuclear norm regularization could offer a balance between the
subspace-preserving and connectedness properties, but this comes at the cost of
increased computational complexity. This paper focuses on using L1 norm and
alleviating the corresponding connectivity problem by a simple yet efficient

to a mechanical oscillator. A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance
frequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the
position of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in
the electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal
magnitude. In a quantum theory, however, an asymmetry between the sidebands can
be resolved when the oscillator's average number of vibrational excitations
(phonons) becomes small, i.e., comparable to 1. We discuss the interpretation
of this sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne photodetection measurement scheme
and show that it depends on the choice of detector model. In the optical
regime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum
given by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is
in that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise
spectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures
symmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry
can be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity
in interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree
of freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field.
Finally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where
sideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms.
We show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical
theory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from
those of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures. We discuss the
observable consequences of this deviaton between classical and quantum
theories.

of SIFT in dealing with image transformations. Recently, image representations
based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing
interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this
time of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of
instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories, SIFT-based and
CNN-based methods, are presented. For the former, according to the codebook
size, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks.
For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained or
fine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass
of an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-based
feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance
retrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories,
and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods.
After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories on
several datasets, we discuss promising directions towards generic and
specialized instance retrieval.

nonperturbative-renormalization-group studies of the three-dimensional

the superfluid ferromagnetic phase in a spin-one Bose gas is weakly first order
and shows pseudoscaling behavior. The (nonuniversal) pseudoscaling exponent
$\nu$ is fully determined by the scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$. We provide
estimates of $\nu$ in $^{87}$Rb, $^{41}$K and $^7$Li atom gases which can be
tested experimentally. We argue that pseudoscaling comes from either a
crossover phenomena due to proximity of the O(6) Wilson-Fisher fixed point
($^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K) or the existence of two unphysical fixed points (with
complex coordinates) which slow down the RG flow ($^7$Li). These unphysical
fixed points are a remnant of the chiral and antichiral fixed points that exist
in the O($N$)$\times$O(2) model when $N$ is larger than $N_c\simeq 5.3$ (the
transition being then second order and controlled by the chiral fixed point).
Finally, we discuss a O(2)$\times$O(2) lattice model and show that our results,
even though we find the transition to be first order, are compatible with Monte
Carlo simulations yielding an apparent second-order transition.

first derive a theoretical model on the propulsion energy consumption of

defined. Then, for the case of unconstrained trajectory optimization, we show
that both the rate-maximization and energy-minimization designs lead to
vanishing energy efficiency and thus are energy-inefficient in general. Next,
we introduce a practical circular UAV trajectory, under which the UAV's flight
radius and speed are optimized to maximize the energy efficiency for
communication. Furthermore, an efficient design is proposed for maximizing the
UAV's energy efficiency with general constraints on its trajectory, including
its initial/final locations and velocities, as well as maximum speed and

significantly higher energy efficiency for UAV communication as compared with

presence of Doppler velocity fluctuations in the solar corona. The observed
fluctuations are thought to be transverse waves, i.e. highly incompressible
motions whose restoring force is dominated by the magnetic tension, some of
which demonstrate clear periodicity. We aim to exploit CoMP's ability to
provide high cadence observations of the off-limb corona to investigate the
properties of velocity fluctuations in a range of coronal features, providing
insight into how(if) the properties of the waves are influenced by the varying
magnetic topology in active regions, quiet Sun and open fields regions. An
analysis of Doppler velocity time-series of the solar corona from the
$10,747$~{\AA} Iron XIII line is performed, determining the velocity power
spectra and using it as a tool to probe wave behaviour. Further, the average
phase speed and density for each region are estimated and used to compute the
spectra for energy density and energy flux. In addition, we assess the noise
levels associated with the CoMP data, deriving analytic formulae for the
uncertainty on Doppler velocity measurements and providing a comparison by
estimating the noise from the data. It is found that the entire corona is
replete with transverse wave behaviour. The corresponding power spectra
indicates that the observed velocity fluctuations are predominately generated
by stochastic processes, with the spectral slope of the power varying between
the different magnetic regions. Most strikingly, all power spectra reveal the
presence of enhanced power occurring at $ \sim3$~mHz, potentially implying that
the excitation of coronal transverse waves by $p$-modes is a global phenomenon.

the first level of the polynomial time hierarchy (PH). Tackling search problems
beyond NP using ASP is less straightforward. The class of disjunctive logic
programs offers the most prominent way of reaching the second level of the PH,
but encoding respective hard problems as disjunctive programs typically
requires sophisticated techniques such as saturation or meta-interpretation.
The application of such techniques easily leads to encodings that are
inaccessible to non-experts. Furthermore, while disjunctive ASP solvers often
rely on calls to a (co-)NP oracle, it may be difficult to detect from the input
program where the oracle is being accessed. In other formalisms, such as
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs), the interface to the underlying oracle is
more transparent as it is explicitly recorded in the quantifier prefix of a
formula. On the other hand, ASP has advantages over QBFs from the modeling
perspective. The rich high-level languages such as ASP-Core-2 offer a wide
variety of primitives that enable concise and natural encodings of search
problems. In this paper, we present a novel logic programming--based modeling
paradigm that combines the best features of ASP and QBFs. We develop so-called
combined logic programs in which oracles are directly cast as (normal) logic
programs themselves. Recursive incarnations of this construction enable logic
programming on arbitrarily high levels of the PH. We develop a proof-of-concept

a Lax--Oleinik formula adapted to evolutive weakly coupled systems of

formula, with the relevant difference that it has a stochastic character since
it involves, loosely speaking, random switchings between the various associated
Lagrangians. We prove that the related value functions are viscosity solutions
to the system, and establish existence of minimal random curves under fairly
general hypotheses. Adding Tonelli like assumptions on the Hamiltonians, we
show differentiability properties of such minimizers, and existence of adjoint
random curves. Minimizers and adjoint curves are trajectories of a twisted

through a sample is enhanced by efficiently coupling to open transmission

properties are investigated by enhancing the transmission, fixing the incident
wavefront and scanning the wavelength of the laser. We measure the transmitted

total transmission. We find that optimizing the total transmission leads to a
significant increase in the frequency width of the field correlation function.
Additionally we find that the enhanced transmission persists over an even
larger frequency bandwidth. This result shows open channels in the diffusive

field, including on small physical scales, where matter clustering is affected
by baryonic physics in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as star formation,
supernovae feedback and AGN feedback. While muddying any cosmological
information that is contained in small scale cosmic shear measurements, this
does mean that cosmic shear has the potential to constrain baryonic physics and
galaxy formation. We perform an analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Science Verification (SV) cosmic shear measurements, now extended to smaller
scales, and using the Mead et al. 2015 halo model to account for baryonic
feedback. While the SV data has limited statistical power, we demonstrate using
a simulated likelihood analysis that the final DES data will have the
statistical power to differentiate among baryonic feedback scenarios. We also
explore some of the difficulties in interpreting the small scales in cosmic
shear measurements, presenting estimates of the size of several other
systematic effects that make inference from small scales difficult, including
uncertainty in the modelling of intrinsic alignment on nonlinear scales,
`lensing bias', and shape measurement selection effects. For the latter two, we
make use of novel image simulations. While future cosmic shear datasets have
the statistical power to constrain baryonic feedback scenarios, there are
several systematic effects that require improved treatments, in order to make
robust conclusions about baryonic feedback.

kept at a constant level of emotional closeness. For primates, including
humans, failure to interact leads inexorably to a decline in relationship
quality, and a consequent loss of the benefits that derive from individual
relationships. As a result, many social species compensate for weakened
relationships by investing more heavily in them. Here we study how humans
behave in similar situations, using data from mobile call detail records from a
European country. For the less frequent contacts between pairs of communicating
individuals we observe a logarithmic dependence of the duration of the
succeeding call on the time gap with the previous call. We find that such
behaviour is likely when the individuals in these dyadic pairs have the same
gender and are in the same age bracket as well as being geographically distant.
Our results indicate that these pairs deliberately invest more time in
communication so as to reinforce their social bonding and prevent their
relationships decaying when these are threatened by lack of interaction.

structured components, is an active research topic in many areas, such as music
and image signal processing, applied physics and text mining. In this paper, we
introduce the Positive $\alpha$-stable (P$\alpha$S) distributions to model the
latent sources, which are a subclass of the stable distributions family. They
notably permit us to model random variables that are both nonnegative and
impulsive. Considering the L\'evy distribution, the only P$\alpha$S
distribution whose density is tractable, we propose a mixture model called
L\'evy Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (L\'evy NMF). This model accounts for
low-rank structures in nonnegative data that possibly has high variability or
is corrupted by very adverse noise. The model parameters are estimated in a
maximum-likelihood sense. We also derive an estimator of the sources given the
parameters, which extends the validity of the generalized Wiener filtering to
the P$\alpha$S case. Experiments on synthetic data show that L\'evy NMF
compares favorably with state-of-the art techniques in terms of robustness to
impulsive noise. The analysis of two types of realistic signals is also
considered: musical spectrograms and fluorescence spectra of chemical species.
The results highlight the potential of the L\'evy NMF model for decomposing

accumulate-and-jam (AnJ), to improve physical layer security in wireless
communications. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) friendly jammer is deployed to
secure the direct communication between source and destination in the presence
of a passive eavesdropper. We consider the friendly jammer as an
energy-constrained node without embedded power supply but with an energy
harvesting unit and rechargeable energy storage; it can thus harvest energy
from the radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by the source, accumulate the
energy in its battery, and then use this energy to perform cooperative jamming.
In the proposed AnJ protocol, based on the energy status of the jammer and the
channel state of source-destination link, the system operates in either
dedicated energy harvesting (DEH) or opportunistic energy harvesting (OEH)
mode. Thanks to the FD capability, the jammer also harvests energy from the
information-bearing signal that it overhears from the source. We study the
complex energy accumulation and consumption procedure at the jammer by
considering a practical finite-capacity energy storage, of which the long-term
stationary distribution is characterized through applying a discrete-state
Markov Chain. An alternative energy storage with infinite capacity is also
studied to serve as an upper bound. We further derive closed-form expressions
for two secrecy metrics, i.e., secrecy outage probability and probability of
positive secrecy capacity. In addition, the impact of imperfect channel state
information on the performance of our proposed protocol is also investigated.
Numerical results validate all theoretical analyses and reveal the merits of
the proposed AnJ protocol over its half-duplex counterpart.

errors and uncertainties in the characterization of exoplanets. Most of the
techniques used to correct for this activity focus on an ad hoc data reduction.
Aims. We have developed a software for the combined fit of transits and stellar
activity features in high-precision long-duration photometry. Our aim is to
take advantage of the modelling to derive correct stellar and planetary
parameters, even in the case of strong stellar activity. Methods. We use an
analytic approach to model the light curve. The code KSint, modified by adding
the evolution of active regions, is implemented into our Bayesian modelling
package PASTIS. The code is then applied to the light curve of CoRoT-2. The
light curve is divided in segments to reduce the number of free parameters
needed by the fit. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis in two ways.
In the first, we perform a global and independent modelling of each segment of
the light curve, transits are not normalized and are fitted together with the
activity features, and occulted features are taken into account during the
transit fit. In the second, we normalize the transits with a model of the
non-occulted activity features, and then we apply a standard transit fit, which
does not take the occulted features into account. Results. Our model recovers
the activity features coverage of the stellar surface and different rotation
periods for different features. We find variations in the transit parameters of
different segments and show that they are likely due to the division applied to
the light curve. Neglecting stellar activity or even only bright spots while
normalizing the transits yields a $\sim 1.2\sigma$ larger and $2.3\sigma$
smaller transit depth, respectively. The stellar density also presents up to
$2.5\sigma$ differences depending on the normalization technique...

that offers an intuitive, declarative syntax for problem solving. In its
traditional application, a fixed ASP program for a given problem is designed
and the actual instance of the problem is fed into the program as a set of
facts. This approach typically results in programs with comparably short and
simple rules. However, as is known from complexity analysis, such an approach
limits the expressive power of ASP; in fact, an entire NP-check can be encoded
into a single large rule body of bounded arity that performs both a guess and a
check within the same rule.
  Here, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding hard problems in ASP by making
explicit use of large rules which depend on the actual instance of the problem.
We illustrate how this new encoding paradigm can be used, providing examples of
problems from the first, second, and even third level of the polynomial
hierarchy. As state-of-the-art solvers are tuned towards short rules, rule
decomposition is a key technique in the practical realization of our approach.
We also provide some preliminary benchmarks which indicate that giving up the
convenient way of specifying a fixed program can lead to a significant
speed-up.

luminosity of 37.3 pb$^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The
contribution of hard double-parton scattering to the production of four-jet
events is extracted using an artificial neural network, assuming that hard
double-parton scattering can be approximated by an uncorrelated overlaying of
dijet events. For events containing at least four jets with transverse momentum
$p_{\mathrm{T}} \geq 20$ GeV and pseudorapidity $\eta \leq 4.4$, and at least
one having $p_{\mathrm{T}} \geq 42.5$ GeV, the contribution of hard

combining this measurement with those of the inclusive dijet and four-jet

networks, we consider the scenario that the AF relay has no embedded energy
supply, and it is equipped with an energy harvesting unit and rechargeable
battery. As such, it can accumulate the energy harvested from both sources'
signals before helping forwarding their information. In this paper, we develop
a power splitting-based energy accumulation (PS-EA) scheme for the considered
WP-TWRN. To determine whether the relay has accumulated sufficient energy, we
set a predefined energy threshold for the relay. When the accumulated energy
reaches the threshold, relay splits the received signal power into two parts,
one for energy harvesting and the other for information forwarding. If the
stored energy at the relay is below the threshold, all the received signal
power will be accumulated at the relay's battery. By modeling the
finite-capacity battery of relay as a finite-state Markov Chain (MC), we derive
a closed-form expression for the system throughput of the proposed PS-EA scheme
over Nakagami-m fading channels. Numerical results validate our theoretical
analysis and show that the proposed PS-EA scheme outperforms the conventional

is obtained by remapping the problem onto a fixed domain and using appropriate

paper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for
realizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass

heuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on
traditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class
or view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative
boosting across any finite dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The
boosting framework is based on forward stagewise additive model which minimizes
a novel exponential loss function. We show that the exponential loss function
essentially captures difficulty of a training sample space instead of the
traditional `1/0' loss. The new algorithm restricts a weak view from over
learning and thereby preventing overfitting. The model is inspired by our
earlier attempt on collaborative boosting which was devoid of mathematical
justification. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge much nearer to
global minimum in the exponential loss space and thus supersedes our previous
algorithm. The paper also presents analytical and numerical analysis of
convergence and margin bounds for multiview boosting algorithms and we show
that our proposed ensemble learning manifests lower error bound and higher

boundary of a chiral medium with continuous helical symmetry of the dielectric
tensor. The tangential wave number is assumed to be zero. The state appears to
be localized near the boundary. It does not transfer energy along this boundary
and falls off exponentially with the distance from the boundary. The field
penetration into chiral medium is blocked at wavelengths close to the helical
pitch and corresponding to the photonic band gap. The polarization of light
near the boundary has the same sign of chirality as the helical medium. It is
shown that the homogeneous environment, or the substrate must exhibit the
anisotropic metallic reflection. Spectral manifestation of the state is
determined by the angle between the optical axes at the interface. A realistic
example is considered at the boundary of a cholesteric liquid crystal and a
metal-dielectric anisotropic nanocomposite.

evaluated from the ultra-dense electron-phonon coupling matrix elements
calculated by adopting the density functional perturbation theory and Wannier
interpolation, rather than the generally used deformation potential theory
which only considers the electron-acoustic phonon scattering. It is found that
the thermoelectric performance of {\gamma}-graphyne exhibits a strong
dependence on the temperature and carrier type. At an intermediate temperature
of 600 K, a maximum ZT value of 1.5 and 1.0 can be achieved for the p- and

superresolution can be obtained using an acoustic vortex wave antenna. This is
accomplished by leveraging the recent advances in optical vortices in
conjunction with the topological diversity of a leaky wave antenna design. In
particular, the use of an acoustic vortex wave antenna eliminates the need for
a complicated phased array consisting of multiple active elements, and enables
a superresolving aperture to be achieved with a single simple acoustic source
and total aperture size less than a wavelength in diameter. A theoretical
formulation is presented for the design of an acoustic vortex wave antenna with
arbitrary planar arrangement, and explicit expressions are developed for the
radiated acoustic pressure field. This geometric versatility enables
variously-shaped acoustic vortex patterns to be achieved, which propagate from
the near-field into the far-field through an arrangement of stable integer mode
vortices. Two examples are presented and discussed in detail, illustrating the
generation and transmission of an ""X"" and ""Y"" shape into the far-field. Despite
the total aperture size being less than a wavelength in diameter, the proposed
acoustic vortex wave antenna is shown to achieve far-field superresolution with
feature sizes 4-9 times smaller than the resolution limit.

However, if the orbital motion approaches a resonance with one of the internal

to break down, and the tides become dynamical. In this paper, we consider
dynamical tides in general relativity due to the quadrupolar fundamental
oscillation mode of a neutron star. We devise a description of the effects of
the neutron star's finite size on the orbital dynamics based on an effective
point-particle action augmented by dynamical quadrupolar degrees of freedom. We
analyze the post-Newtonian and test-particle approximations of this model and
incorporate the results into an effective-one-body Hamiltonian. This enables us
to extend the description of dynamical tides over the entire inspiral. We
demonstrate that dynamical tides give a significant enhancement of matter
effects compared to adiabatic tides, at least for neutron stars with large
radii and for low mass-ratio systems, and should therefore be included in
accurate models for gravitational-wave data analysis.

communication complexity, i.e. the number of transmitted bits necessary to
communicate a 1-bit secret, from O(n^3 log n) to O(n^2 log n). Our protocol
also answers a question raised by Kurosawa and Suzuki and hitherto left open:
their protocol reaches optimal transmission rate for a secret of size O(n^2 log
n) bits, and the authors raised the problem of lowering this threshold. The
present solution does this for a secret of O(n log n) bits. Additionally, we
show how our protocol can be adapted to a Network Coding context.

several decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and
reoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. However, much less
is known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality
are not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.
  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution
patterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific
patterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a
""one fits it all"" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these
intuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables
and metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as
for interpolating graph evolutions.
  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,
this paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node
importance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality
distance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given
centrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances
reflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in
case of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.
  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and
seven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the
usefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared
to a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the
considered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the
dynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.

many groups, especially the condensation and overcharging of DNA by multivalent
counterions. By adding counterions of different valencies and shapes, one can
enhance or reduce DNA overcharging. In this papers, we focus on the effect of
multivalent co-ions, specifically divalent co-ions such as SO$_4^{2-}$. A
computational experiment of DNA condensation using Monte$-$Carlo simulation in
grand canonical ensemble is carried out where DNA system is in equilibrium with
a bulk solution containing a mixture of salt of different valency of co-ions.
Compared to system with purely monovalent co-ions, the influence of divalent
co-ions shows up in multiple aspects. Divalent co-ions lead to an increase of
monovalent salt in the DNA condensate. Because monovalent salts mostly
participate in linear screening of electrostatic interactions in the system,
more monovalent salt molecules enter the condensate leads to screening out of
short-range DNA$-$DNA like charge attraction and weaker DNA condensation free
energy. The overcharging of DNA by multivalent counterions is also reduced in
the presence of divalent co$-$ions. Strong repulsions between DNA and divalent
co-ions and among divalent co-ions themselves leads to a {\em depletion} of
negative ions near DNA surface as compared to the case without divalent
co-ions. At large distance, the DNA$-$DNA repulsive interaction is stronger in
the presence of divalent co$-$ions, suggesting that divalent co$-$ions role is
not only that of simple stronger linear screening.

colorful choice. Despite several efforts in the past, the computational
complexity of CCP in arbitrary dimension is still open.
  We show that CCP lies in the intersection of the complexity classes PPAD and

these problems. Finally, we show that our PPAD formulation leads to a

(AGNs) displays significant aperiodic variabilities. The most promising
explanation for these variabilities is the propagating fluctuations in the
accretion flow. It is natural to expect that the mechanism driving
variabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in a black hole hyper-accretion
disk, which is believed to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We study the
variabilities of jet power in GRBs based on the model of propagating
fluctuations. It is found that the variabilities of jet power and the temporal
profile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed
light curves of prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs. Our results show that the
mechanism driving X-ray variabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in the
central engine to drive the variabilities of GRBs.

importance in a variety of fields, from biophysics to micro-/nanofluidics.
However, due to challenges in experimental measurements of near-boundary
dynamics, the effect of interfaces on Brownian motion has remained elusive.
Here, we report a computational study of this effect using microsecond-long
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and our newly developed Green-Kubo
relation for friction at the liquid-solid interface. Our computer experiment
unambiguously reveals that the t^(-3/2) long-time decay of the velocity
autocorrelation function of a Brownian particle in bulk liquid is replaced by a
t^(-5/2) decay near a boundary. We discover a general breakdown of traditional
no-slip boundary condition at short time scales and we show that this breakdown
has a profound impact on the near-boundary Brownian motion. Our results
demonstrate the potential of Brownian-particle based micro-/nano-sonar to probe
the local wettability of liquid-solid interfaces.

instruments for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS is composed of a
combination of near-infrared (0.84--2.4 $\mu$m) diffraction limited imager and
integral field spectrograph. To achieve near-diffraction limited resolutions in
the near-infrared wavelength region, IRIS uses the advanced adaptive optics
system NFIRAOS (Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System) and integrated
on-instrument wavefront sensors (OIWFS). However, IRIS itself has challenging
specifications. First, the overall system wavefront error should be less than
40 nm in Y, z, J, and H-band and 42 nm in K-band over a 34.0 $\times$ 34.0
arcsecond field of view. Second, the throughput of the imager components should
be more than 42 percent. To achieve the extremely low wavefront error and high
throughput, all reflective design has been newly proposed. We have adopted a
new design policy called ""Co-Axis double-TMA"", which cancels the asymmetric
aberrations generated by ""collimator/TMA"" and ""camera/TMA"" efficiently. The
latest imager design meets all specifications, and, in particular, the
wavefront error is less than 17.3 nm and throughput is more than 50.8 percent.
However, to meet the specification of wavefront error and throughput as built
performance, the IRIS imager requires both mirrors with low surface
irregularity after high-reflection coating in cryogenic and high-level Assembly
Integration and Verification (AIV). To deal with these technical challenges, we
have done the tolerance analysis and found that total pass rate is almost 99
percent in the case of gauss distribution and more than 90 percent in the case
of parabolic distribution using four compensators. We also have made an AIV
plan and feasibility check of the optical elements. In this paper, we will
present the details of this optical system.

black holes (BBHs) provided direct evidence of the existence of these systems.
BBH lenses would have gravitational microlensing signatures that are distinct
from single-lens signals. We apply Bayesian statistics to examine the
distinguishability of BBH microlensing events from single-lens events under
ideal observing conditions, using the photometric capabilities of the Korean
Microlensing Telescope Network. Given one year of observations, a source star
at the Galactic Centre, a GW150914-like BBH lens (total mass 65M$_\odot$, mass
ratio 0.8) at half that distance, and an impact parameter of 0.4 Einstein
radii, we find that binarity is detectable for BBHs with separations down to
0.0250 Einstein radii, which is nearly 3.5 times greater than the maximum
separation for which such BBHs would merge within the age of the Universe.
Microlensing searches are thus sensitive to more widely separated BBHs than GW
searches, perhaps allowing the discovery of BBH populations produced in
different channels of binary formation.

is adiabatic invariant of electromagnetic field propagating on the

parameters gives value h=6x10(-27) (erg s). We also confirm that Planck
constant (and hence other fundamental constants which depend on h) is varied on
time due to changing of geometry.
  As an example the variation of the fine structure constant is calculated. Its
relative variation ((da/dt)/a) consist 1.0x10(-18) (1/s).
  We show that on the Finsler manifold characterized by adiabatically changed
geometry, classical free electromagnetic field is quantized geometrically, from
the properties of the manifold in such manner that adiabatic invariant of field
is ET=6x10(-27)=h(erg s).
  Equations of electrodynamics on the Finslerian manifold are suggested. It is
stressed that quantization naturally appears from these equations and is
provoked by adiabatically changed geometry of manifold. We consider in details
two direct consequences of the equations: i) cosmological redshift of photons
and ii) effects of Aharonov -- Bohm that immediately follow from obtained
equations. It is shown that quantization of system consists of electromagnetic
field and baryonic components (like atoms) is obvious and has clear
explanation.
