discovered at the large hadron collider, so as to enforce its mass

cleanest signatures are selected: $\gamma\gamma$ and $ZZ^*\to 4l$ ($l=e,~\mu$).
We show how both of these can be accessed with foreseen energy and luminosity

applications, such as detecting suspicious access to a socket from a process.
In many cases, such events can be described as a collection of categorical
values that are considered as entities of different types, which we call
heterogeneous categorical events. Due to the lack of intrinsic distance
measures among entities, and the exponentially large event space, most existing
work relies heavily on heuristics to calculate abnormal scores for events.
Different from previous work, we propose a principled and unified probabilistic
model APE (Anomaly detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity
embedding) that directly models the likelihood of events. In this model, we
embed entities into a common latent space using their observed co-occurrence in
different events. More specifically, we first model the compatibility of each
pair of entities according to their embeddings. Then we utilize the weighted
pairwise interactions of different entity types to define the event
probability. Using Noise-Contrastive Estimation with ""context-dependent"" noise
distribution, our model can be learned efficiently regardless of the large
event space. Experimental results on real enterprise surveillance data show
that our methods can accurately detect abnormal events compared to other
state-of-the-art abnormal detection techniques.

changes in solar ultraviolet radiation (specifically UVB, 280-315 nm) at
Earth's surface. Variation in UVB exposure as inferred from these features has
been suggested as a proxy for paleoaltitude. While UVB irradiance does increase
with altitude above sea level, a number of other factors affect the irradiance
at any given place and time. In this modeling study we use the TUV atmospheric
radiative transfer model to investigate dependence of surface-level UVB
irradiance and relative biological impact on a number of constituents in
Earth's atmosphere that are variable over long and short time periods. We
consider changes in O3 column density, and SO2 and sulfate aerosols due to
periods of volcanic activity, including that associated with the formation of
the Siberian Traps. We find that UVB irradiance may be highly variable under
volcanic conditions and variations in several of these atmospheric constituents
can easily mimic or overwhelm changes in UVB irradiance due to changes in
altitude. On the other hand, we find that relative change with altitude is not
very sensitive to different sets of atmospheric conditions. Any paleoaltitude
proxy based on UVB exposure requires confidence that the samples under
comparison were located at roughly the same latitude, under very similar O3 and
SO2 columns, with similar atmospheric aerosol conditions. In general, accurate
estimates of the surface-level UVB exposure at any time and location require
detailed radiative transfer modeling taking into account a number of
atmospheric factors; this result is important for paleoaltitude proxies as well
as attempts to reconstruct the UV environment through geologic time and to tie
extinctions, such as the end-Permian mass extinction, to UVB irradiance
changes.

between the strongly correlated spin-only 3d ions with the strongly spin-orbit

frequency signals. A single source-destination pair is considered without a
direct link. The connecting relay nodes are equipped with storage batteries of
infinite size. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) on the
source-relay link is available at the relay nodes. Depending on the
availability of the CSI on the relay-destination link at the relay node, we
propose different relay selection schemes and evaluate the outage probability.
The availability of the CSI at the relay node on the relay-destination link
considerably improves the performance due to additional flexibility in the
relay selection mechanism. We numerically quantify the performance for the
proposed schemes and compare the outage probability for fixed and equal number
of wireless powered forwarding relays.

into the universe. How does the presence of one limit the expansionistic
ambitions of another, and what sort of boundary forms between their expanding
domains? We describe a general scenario for any expansion speed, separation
distance, and time. We then specialize to a question of particular interest:
What are the future prospects for a young and ambitious civilization if they
can observe the presence of another at a cosmological distance? We treat cases
involving the observation of one or two expanding domains. In the
single-observation case, we find that almost any plausible detection will limit
one's future cosmic expansion to some extent. Also, practical technological
limits to expansion speed (well below the speed of light) play an interesting
role. If a domain is visible at the time one embarks on cosmic expansion,
higher practical limits to expansion speed are beneficial only up to a certain
point. Beyond this point, a higher speed limit means that gains in the ability
to expand are more than offset by the first-mover advantage of the observed
domain. In the case of two visible domains, it is possible to be ""trapped"" by
them if the practical speed limit is high enough and their angular separation
in the sky is large enough, i.e. one's expansion in any direction will
terminate at a boundary with the two visible civilizations. Detection at an
extreme cosmological distance has surprisingly little mitigating effect on our
conclusions.

estimation problem for a non-linear dynamic system, utilizing a derivative-free

approximating a non-linear function. Applying the UT to a Kalman filter type
estimator leads to the well-known unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Although the
UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate
significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is

the UKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is
proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF).
In MCUF, the UT is applied to obtain the prior estimates of the state and

the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is then used to obtain the posterior
estimates of the state and covariance. The satisfying performance of the new

  Algorithms, and Limits","Correction of typos in proofs",,,,"math.OC cs.RO cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we focus on batch state estimation for linear systems. This
problem is important in applications such as environmental field estimation,
robotic navigation, and target tracking. Its difficulty lies on that limited
operational resources among the sensors, e.g., shared communication bandwidth
or battery power, constrain the number of sensors that can be active at each
measurement step. As a result, sensor scheduling algorithms must be employed.
Notwithstanding, current sensor scheduling algorithms for batch state
estimation scale poorly with the system size and the time horizon. In addition,
current sensor scheduling algorithms for Kalman filtering, although they scale
better, provide no performance guarantees or approximation bounds for the
minimization of the batch state estimation error. In this paper, one of our
main contributions is to provide an algorithm that enjoys both the estimation
accuracy of the batch state scheduling algorithms and the low time complexity
of the Kalman filtering scheduling algorithms. In particular: 1) our algorithm
is near-optimal: it achieves a solution up to a multiplicative factor 1/2 from
the optimal solution, and this factor is close to the best approximation factor
1/e one can achieve in polynomial time for this problem; 2) our algorithm has
(polynomial) time complexity that is not only lower than that of the current
algorithms for batch state estimation; it is also lower than, or similar to,
that of the current algorithms for Kalman filtering. We achieve these results
by proving two properties for our batch state estimation error metric, which
quantifies the square error of the minimum variance linear estimator of the
batch state vector: a) it is supermodular in the choice of the sensors; b) it
has a sparsity pattern (it involves matrices that are block tri-diagonal) that
facilitates its evaluation at each sensor set.

the BPG from the ONS (electric systems national operator), consisting of
high-voltage transmission lines, generating stations and substations. The local
low-voltage substations and local power delivery as well the dynamic features

identify the main topological information, such as the mean degree, the degree
distribution, the network size and the clustering coefficient to caracterize

and, therefore, the more susceptible points to lead to a cascading failure and
even to a blackouts. Surprisely, due to the characteristic of the topology and
physical structure of the network, we show that the BPG is resilient against
random failures, since the random removal of links does not affect
significantly the size of the largest cluster. We observe that when a fraction
of the links are randomly removed, the network may disintegrates into smaller

connected. We believe that the even a static study of the network topology can
help to identify the critical situations and also prevent failures and possible

collider under development. For an optimal exploitation of its physics
potential, CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in a staged approach with
three centre-of-mass energy stages ranging from a few hundred GeV up to 3 TeV.
The first stage will focus on precision Standard Model physics, in particular
Higgs and top-quark measurements. Subsequent stages will focus on measurements
of rare Higgs processes, as well as searches for new physics processes and
precision measurements of new states, e.g. states previously discovered at LHC
or at CLIC itself. In the 2012 CLIC Conceptual Design Report, a fully optimised
3 TeV collider was presented, while the proposed lower energy stages were not
studied to the same level of detail. This report presents an updated baseline
staging scenario for CLIC. The scenario is the result of a comprehensive study
addressing the performance, cost and power of the CLIC accelerator complex as a
function of centre-of-mass energy and it targets optimal physics output based
on the current physics landscape. The optimised staging scenario foresees three
main centre-of-mass energy stages at 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV for a full CLIC
programme spanning 22 years. For the first stage, an alternative to the CLIC
drive beam scheme is presented in which the main linac power is produced using
X-band klystrons.

Higgs physics reach of CLIC operating at three energy stages: sqrt(s) = 350
GeV, 1.4 TeV and 3 TeV. The initial stage of operation allows the study of
Higgs boson production in Higgsstrahlung (e+e- -> ZH) and WW-fusion (e+e- ->
Hnunu), resulting in precise measurements of the production cross sections, the
Higgs total decay width Gamma_H, and model-independent determinations of the
Higgs couplings. Operation at sqrt(s) > 1 TeV provides high-statistics samples
of Higgs bosons produced through WW-fusion, enabling tight constraints on the
Higgs boson couplings. Studies of the rarer processes e+e- -> ttH and e+e- ->
HHnunu allow measurements of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs boson
self-coupling. This paper presents detailed studies of the precision achievable
with Higgs measurements at CLIC and describes the interpretation of these
measurements in a global fit.

insight into the underlying electronic dynamics that determine its optical

implemented to explore these dynamics through demodulation of the complex
optical signal field into its quadrature components; however, complete
reconstruction of the optical response requires measuring both the amplitude
and phase of each quadrature, which is often lost in standard detection
methods. Here, we implement a heterodyne-detection scheme to fully reconstruct
the amplitude and phase response of spectral hole-burning from InAs/GaAs
charged quantum dots. We observe an ultra-narrow absorption profile and a
corresponding dispersive lineshape of the phase, which reflect the nanosecond
optical coherence time of the charged exciton transition. Simultaneously, the
measurements are sensitive to electron spin relaxation dynamics on a
millisecond timescale, as this manifests as a magnetic-field dependent delay of
the amplitude and phase modulation. Appreciable amplitude modulation depth and
nonlinear phase shift up to 0.09$\times\pi$ radians (16$\deg$) are
demonstrated, providing new possibilities for quadrature modulation at faint
photon levels with several independent control parameters, including photon
number, modulation frequency, detuning, and externally applied fields.

different positions. However, typical observational data are integrated data or
contemplate specific portions of the remnant. We study the spatial variation in
the physical properties of the N\,49 supernova remnant based on a spectroscopic
mapping of the whole nebula. Long-slit spectra were obtained with the slit
($\sim4\arcmin \times 1.03\arcsec$) aligned along the east-west direction from
29 different positions spaced by $2\arcsec$ in declination. A total of 3248 1D
spectra were extracted from sections of $2\arcsec$ of the 2D spectra. More than
60 emission lines in the range 3550\,\AA{} to 8920\,\AA{} were measured in
these spectra. Maps of the fluxes and of intensity ratios of these emission
lines were built with a spatial resolution of $2\arcsec \times 2\arcsec$. An
electron density map has been obtained using the [S\,{\sc
ii}]\,$\lambda6716/\lambda6731$ line ratio. Values vary from
$\sim$500\,cm$^{-3}$ at the northeast region to more than 3500 cm$^{-3}$ at the
southeast border. We calculated electron temperature using line ratio sensors
for the ions S$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, O$^{+}$, and N$^{+}$. Values are about
3.6$\times10^{4}$\,K for the O$^{++}$ sensor and about 1.1$\times10^{4}$\,K for
other sensors. The H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio map presents a ring structure with
higher values that may result from collisional excitation of hydrogen. We
detected an area with high values of [N\,{\sc ii}]\,$\lambda6583$/H$\alpha$
extending from the remnant center to its northeastern border, that can be
indicating an overabundance of nitrogen in the area due to contamination by the
progenitor star. We found a radial dependence in many line intensity ratio
maps. We observed an increase toward the remnant borders of the intensity ratio
of any two lines in which the numerator comes before in a sequence of lines.

shared memory system, are a significant, yet often under-appreciated, aspect of
system design. MCMs are defined at the various layers of the hardware-software
stack, requiring thoroughly verified specifications, compilers, and
implementations at the interfaces between layers. Current verification
techniques evaluate segments of the system stack in isolation, such as proving
compiler mappings from a high-level language (HLL) to an ISA or proving
validity of a microarchitectural implementation of an ISA.
  This paper makes a case for full-stack MCM verification and provides a
toolflow, TriCheck, capable of verifying that the HLL, compiler, ISA, and
implementation collectively uphold MCM requirements. The work showcases
TriCheck's ability to evaluate a proposed ISA MCM in order to ensure that each
layer and each mapping is correct and complete. Specifically, we apply TriCheck
to the open source RISC-V ISA, seeking to verify accurate, efficient, and legal
compilations from C11. We uncover under-specifications and potential
inefficiencies in the current RISC-V ISA documentation and identify possible
solutions for each. As an example, we find that a RISC-V-compliant
microarchitecture allows 144 outcomes forbidden by C11 to be observed out of
1,701 litmus tests examined. Overall, this paper demonstrates the necessity of
full-stack verification for detecting MCM-related bugs in the hardware-software
stack.

misalignment parameters using ZEMAX software. We perform a principal component
analysis (PCA) on the simulated dataset to obtain Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) modes,
which form the basis set whose weights are the system measurements. A model
function which maps the state to the measurement is learned using nonlinear
least squares fitting and serves as the measurement function for the nonlinear

Control, Free-Carrier Oscillations, Optical Ising Machines and Pulsed OPO
Dynamics. Tying them all together is a theory of open quantum systems called
the SLH model, which I introduce in Chapters 1-2. The SLH model is a general
framework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is
the basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG
control is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent
feedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear
quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's
simultaneous utilization of both light quadratures. Semiclassical
truncated-Wigner techniques for quantum-optical networks are discussed in
Chapter 5, leading to a thorough discussion of quantum noise in systems with
free-carrier nonlinearities (Chapter 6), comparison to the Kerr nonlinearity,
and potential applications for analog computing based on limit cycles and
amplification (Chapters 7-8). Ising machines based on optical parametric
oscillators (OPOs) are discussed in Chapters 9-10, the former focusing on large
1D and 2D networks of OPOs, and the latter on the dynamics of a single OPO in
the ultrafast, synchronously-pumped regime. Optical properties and design
considerations for silicon photonic waveguides are are treated in Chapter 11.

(NDSHA) is available nowadays, which permits considering a wide range of
possible seismic sources as the starting point for deriving scenarios by means
of full waveforms modeling. The method does not make use of attenuation
relations and naturally supplies realistic time series of ground shaking,
including reliable estimates of ground displacement, readily applicable to
complete engineering analysis. Based on the neo-deterministic approach, an
operational integrated procedure for seismic hazard assessment has been
developed that allows for the definition of time dependent scenarios of ground
shaking, through the routine updating of earthquake predictions, performed by
means of the algorithms CN and M8S. The integrated NDSHA procedure for seismic
input definition, which is currently applied to the Italian territory, combines
different pattern recognition techniques, designed for the space-time
identification of strong earthquakes, with algorithms for the realistic
modeling of ground motion. Accordingly, a set of deterministic scenarios of
ground motion at bedrock, which refers to the time interval when a strong event
is likely to occur within the alerted area, is defined both at regional and
local scale. CN and M8S predictions, as well as the related time-dependent
ground motion scenarios associated with the alarmed areas, are routinely
updated since 2006. The prospective application of the time-dependent NDSHA
approach provides information that can be useful in assigning priorities for
timely mitigation actions and, at the same time, allows for a rigorous
validation of the proposed methodology. The results from real-time testing of
the time-dependent NDSHA scenarios are illustrated with specific reference to

diverse dynamical regimes, supporting the validity of this modal description,
while also providing a speedup in simulation times.

abundance analysis of a K=10.2 metal-poor, alpha-enhanced red giant projected
at 1.5 pc from the Galactic Center, using NIRSPEC on Keck II. A careful
analysis of the dynamics and color of the star locates it at about 26 pc

one of the nuclear components (cluster or disk), not to the bar-bulge or

metallicity in the bulge. As known giants with comparable [Fe/H] and alpha
enhancement are old, we conclude that this star is most likely to be a
representative of the ~10 Gyr old population. This is also the most metal poor
confirmed red giant yet discovered in vicinity of the nuclear cluster of the

(entropic) considerations and generalize the well known no-cloning and
no-broadcasting theorems. We also observe and exploit the fact that the
universal cloning machine on the symmetric subspace of $n$ qudits and
symmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality
manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels
and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an
approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice
versa. The duality extends to give control on the performance of generalized
UQCMs on subspaces more general than the symmetric subspace. This gives a way
to quantify the usefulness of a-priori information in the context of cloning.

freeze-out, the dark matter abundance in this scenario is set by dark matter
decay, which is allowed for a limited amount of time just before the
electroweak phase transition. More specifically, we consider fermionic singlet
dark matter particles coupled weakly to a scalar mediator $S_3$ and to
auxiliary dark sector fields, charged under the Standard Model gauge groups.
Dark matter freezes out while still relativistic, so its abundance is initially
very large. As the Universe cools down, the scalar mediator develops a vacuum
expectation value (vev), which breaks the symmetry that stabilises dark matter.
This allows dark matter to mix with charged fermions and decay. During this
epoch, the dark matter abundance is reduced to give the value observed today.
Later, the SM Higgs field also develops a vev, which feeds back into the $S_3$
potential and restores the dark sector symmetry. In a concrete model we show
that this ""vev flip-flop"" scenario is phenomenologically successful in the most
interesting regions of its parameter space. We also comment on detection
prospects at the LHC and elsewhere.

system has prompted a re-think about the evolution of planetary systems. As the
Sun transitions from a main sequence star into a white dwarf, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune are currently assumed to survive in expanded but otherwise
unchanged orbits. However, a sufficiently-distant and sufficiently-massive
extra planet would alter this quiescent end scenario through the combined
effects of Solar giant branch mass loss and Galactic tides. Here, I estimate
bounds for the mass and orbit of a distant extra planet that would incite
future instability in systems with a Sun-like star and giant planets with
masses and orbits equivalent to those of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. I
find that this boundary is diffuse and strongly dependent on each of the
distant planet's orbital parameters. Nevertheless, I claim that instability
occurs more often than not when the planet is as massive as Jupiter and
harbours a semimajor axis exceeding about 300 au, or has a mass of a
super-Earth and a semimajor axis exceeding about 3000 au. These results hold
for orbital pericentres ranging from 100 to at least 400 au. This instability
scenario might represent a common occurrence, as potentially evidenced by the
ubiquity of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres throughout the Galaxy.

performed on the map level where all the sources (including diffuse
intergalactic gas) contribute to the signal. We consider two
configuration-space correlation function estimators, $\xi^{ y-\kappa}$ and
$\xi^ {y-\gamma_{t}}$, and a Fourier space estimator, $C_{\ell}^{y-\kappa}$, in
our analysis. We detect a significant correlation out to three degrees of
angular separation on the sky. Based on statistical noise only, we can report
13$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ detections of the cross-correlation using the
configuration-space $y-\kappa$ and $y-\gamma_{t}$ estimators, respectively.
Including a heuristic estimate of the sampling variance yields a detection
significance of 6$\sigma$ and 8$\sigma$, respectively. A similar level of
detection is obtained from the Fourier-space estimator, $C_{\ell}^{y-\kappa}$.
As each estimator probes different dynamical ranges, their combination improves
the significance of the detection. We compare our measurements with predictions
from the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where
different galactic feedback models are implemented. We find that a model with
considerable AGN feedback that removes large quantities of hot gas from galaxy
groups and WMAP-7yr best-fit cosmological parameters provides the best match to
the measurements. All baryonic models in the context of a Planck cosmology
over-predict the observed signal. Similar cosmological conclusions are drawn
when we employ a halo model with the observed `universal' pressure profile.

investigate two methods to determine the appropriate M/L for a galaxy: 1) We
show that the uncertainties introduced by an unknown SFH can be largely removed
using a spectroscopically inferred luminosity-weighted age and metallicity for
the population to select the appropriate single stellar population (SSP)
equivalent M/L. Using this method, the maximum systematic error due to SFH on
the M/L of an early-type galaxy is $<$ 4$\%$ at 3.4 $\mu$m and typical
uncertainties due to errors in the age and metallicity create scatter of
$\lesssim$13$\%$. The equivalent values for optical bands are more than 2-3
times greater, even before considering uncertainties associated with internal
dust extinction. 2) We demonstrate that if the EAGLE SFHs and metallicities
accurately reproduce the true properties of early-type galaxies, the use of an
iterative approach to select a mass dependent M/L can provide even more
accurate stellar masses for early-type galaxies, with typical uncertainties $<$
9$\%$.

characterized the detector response to single electron events, building an
empirical model which can predict detector MTF and DQE performance based on
energy threshold. Exemplifying our findings we demonstrate the Medipix3 imaging
performance, recording a fully exposed electron diffraction pattern at 24-bit

that for transmission electron microscopy performed at low energies (energies
<100 keV) thick hybrid pixel detectors provide an advantageous and alternative

50 disc galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^10-10^11 Msun, of which half are
bluer and more HI-rich galaxies than their HI-normal (control) counterparts. In
this paper, we investigate how ongoing disc growth affects the molecular gas
distribution and the star-formation efficiency in these galaxies. We present
12CO observations from the IRAM 30-m telescope in 26 galaxies of the Bluedisk
survey. We compare the amount and spatial distribution of the molecular gas to
key quantities such as atomic gas, stellar mass and surface density,
star-formation rate and metallicity. We analyse the star-formation rate per
unit gas (SFR/HI and SFR/H2) and relate all those parameters to general galaxy
properties (HI-rich/control disc, morphology, etc.). We find that the HI-rich
galaxies have similar H2 masses as the control galaxies. In their centres,
HI-rich galaxies have lower H2/HI ratios and marginally shorter molecular gas
depletion times. However, the main differences between the two samples occur in
the outer parts of the discs, with the HI-rich galaxies having slightly smaller
CO discs (relative to the optical radius R25) and steeper CO and metallicity
gradients than the control galaxies. The ongoing accretion of HI at large radii
has thus not led to an appreciable growth of the CO discs in our sample. Based
on depletion times, we estimate that this gas will contribute to star formation
on time-scales of at least 5 Gyr.

detected obvious out-of-eclipse variability in archival photometric data from
the Catalina Sky Survey, which instigated a closer examination of the object. A
spectrum and extensive multicolour photometric observations were acquired, from
which we deduce that NSV 1907 is a deeply eclipsing, nova-like cataclysmic
variable. Apart from the orbital variations (deep eclipses with a period of P ~
6.63 hours), changes in mean brightness and irregular short-term variability
(flickering) were observed. The presence of a secondary minimum at phase phi ~
0.5 was established, which indicates a significant contribution of the
companion star to the optical flux of the system. We find possible evidence for
sinusoidal variations with a period of P ~ 4.2 d, which we interpret as the
nodal precession period of the accretion disc. No outbursts or VY Scl-like
drops in brightness were detected either by the CSS or during our photometric
monitoring. Because of its spectral characteristics and the observed
variability pattern, we propose NSV 1907 as a new moderately bright long-period
SW Sextantis star. Further photometric and spectroscopic observations are
encouraged.

theories, which have been conjectured to be dual to CFTs consisting of the
singlet sector of $N$ free fermion fields. In addition to the case of $N$ Dirac
fermions, we carefully study the projections to Weyl, Majorana, symplectic, and
Majorana-Weyl fermions in the dimensions where they exist. Second, we explore
theories involving elements of both Type A and Type B theories, which we call
Type AB. Their spectrum includes fields of every half-integer spin, and they
are expected to be related to the $U(N)/O(N)$ singlet sector of the CFT of $N$
free complex/real scalar and fermionic fields. Finally, we explore the Type C
theories, which have been conjectured to be dual to the CFTs of $p$-form gauge
fields, where $p=\frac d 2 -1$. In most cases we find that the free energies at
$O(N^0)$ either vanish or give contributions proportional to the free-energy of
a single free field in the conjectured dual CFT. Interpreting these
non-vanishing values as shifts of the bulk coupling constant $G_N\sim 1/(N-k)$,
we find the values $k=-1, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 1, 2$. Exceptions to this rule are the
Type B and AB theories in odd $d$; for them we find a mismatch between the bulk

from a simple shift of the bulk coupling constant.

particular the relaxation value of one-point functions for small quenches. For
a class of quenches we relate this value to the scaling dimensions of the
operators. We argue that the $E_8$ spectrum of the Ising chain can be more
accessible through a quench than at equilibrium, while for a quench of the
plane anisotropy in the XYZ chain we obtain that the one-point function of the
quench operator switches from damped to undamped oscillations at $\Delta=1/2$.

Word-representable graphs have been studied extensively following their
introduction in 2000 and are the subject of a book published by Kitaev in 2015.
Recently there has been interest in studying graphs represented by
pattern-avoiding words. In particular, in 2016, Gao, Kitaev, and Zhang
investigated 132-representable graphs, that is, word-representable graphs that
can be represented by a word which avoids the pattern 132. They proved that all
132- representable graphs are circle graphs and provided examples and
properties of 132-representable graphs. They posed several questions, some of
which we answer in this paper.
  One of our main results is that not all circle graphs are 132-representable,
thus proving that 132-representable graphs are a proper subset of circle
graphs, a question that was left open in the paper by Gao et al. We show that
123-representable graphs are also a proper subset of circle graphs, and are
different from 132-representable graphs. We also study graphs represented by
pattern-avoiding 2-uniform words, that is, words in which every letter appears
exactly twice.

specific attributes of grains, namely, volume, center of mass, average

to track grains during time-row data sets. In the present contribution, we
describe and validate the algorithm, which is then used to analyze grain growth
in polycrystalline Al with a weak texture. For the conditions tested, the
algorithm was able to find all of the input orientations and reconstruct the

qualitative link between the photosphere's magnetic network and enhanced
transition-temperature plasma emission. These observations led to the
development of a general model that describes emission structures through the
partitioning of the atmospheric volume with different magnetic loop geometries
that exhibit different energetic equilibria. Does the internetwork produce
transition-temperature emission? What fraction of network flux connects to the
corona? How does quiet sun emission compare with low-activity Sun-like stars?
In this work, we revisit the canonical model of the quiet sun, with
high-resolution observations from IRIS and HMI in hand, to address those
questions. We use over 900 deep exposures of Si IV 1393A from IRIS along with
nearly simultaneous HMI magnetograms to quantify the correlation between
transition-temperature emission structures and magnetic field concentrations
through a number of novel statistics. Our observational results are coupled
with analysis of the Bifrost MHD model and a large-scale potential field model.
Our results paint a complex portrait of the quiet sun. We measure an emission
signature in the distant internetwork that cannot be attributed to network
contribution. We find that the dimmest regions of emission are not linked to
the local vertical magnetic field. Using the MHD simulation, we categorize the
emission contribution from cool mid-altitude loops and high-altitude coronal
loops and discuss the potential emission contribution of spicules. Our results
provide new constraints on the coupled solar atmosphere so that we can build on
our understanding of how dynamic thermal and magnetic structures generate the
observed phenomena in the transition region.

that this problem exhibits a novel type of critical mass phenomenon with regard
to the formation of singularities, which drastically differs from the
well-known threshold property of the classical Keller-Segel system, as obtained
upon formally taking $\tau\to 0$, in that it refers to blow-up in infinite time

sharp contrast to classical Keller-Segel-type systems reflecting immediate
signal secretion by the cells themselves, the indirect mechanism of signal
production in ($\star$) entirely rules out any occurrence of blow-up in finite
time. However, within the framework of radially symmetric solutions it is next
proved that whenever $\delta>0$ and $\io u_0<8\pi\delta$, the solution remains
uniformly bounded, whereas for any choice of $\delta\ge 0$ and $m>8\pi\delta$,

their uniquely quantum emission and phenomenon of two-photon interference
allowing for the generation and transfer of nonclassical states. Although a few
analytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing pulsed
single-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at
least extremely idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture
of pulsed single-photon sources by elaborating how to numerically and fully
characterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating in a pulsed regime. In
order to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum
Monte--Carlo simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form
of the quantum regression theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed
single-photon source is connected to its photocount distribution and its
measured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence. By doing so, we
provide a description of the relationship between instantaneous source
correlations and the typical experimental interferometers (Hanbury-Brown and
Twiss, Hong-Ou-Mandel, and Mach-Zehnder) used to characterize such sources.
Then, we use these techniques to explore several prototypical quantum systems
and their non-ideal behaviors. As an example numerical result, we show that for
the most popular single-photon source---a resonantly excited two-level
system---its error probability is directly related to its excitation pulse
length. We believe that the intuition gained from these representative systems
and characters can be used to interpret future results with more complicated
source Hamiltonians and behaviors. Finally, we have thoroughly documented our
simulation methods with contributions to the Quantum Optics Toolbox in Python

number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used as aerial base stations to
collect data from the cluster heads (CHs) of a set of M2M clusters. To minimize
the CHs' transmit power while satisfying the rate requirements of M2M devices,
an optimal scheduling and resource allocation mechanism for CH-UAV
communications is proposed. First, using the queue rate stability concept, the
minimum number of UAVs as well as the dwelling time that each UAV must spend
for servicing the CHs are computed. Next, the optimal resource allocation for
the CH-UAV communication links is determined such that M2M devices rate
requirements are satisfied with a minimum transmit power. Simulation results
show that, as the packet transmission probability of machines increases, the
minimum number of UAVs required to guarantee the queue rate stability of CHs
will also significantly increase. Our results also show that, compared to a
case with pre-deployed terrestrial base stations, the average transmit power of
CHs will decrease by 68% when UAVs are used.

limit to the thermal conductivity (k), which is ~1 W/m-K for a-Si. However,
recent work suggested that k of micro-thick a-Si films can be greater than 3
W/m-K, which is contributed by propagating vibrational modes, referred to as
""propagons"". However, precise determination of k in a-Si has been elusive.
Here, we used novel structures of a-Si nanotubes and suspended a-Si films that
enabled precise in-plane k measurement within a wide thickness range of 5 nm to
1.7 um. We showed unexpectedly high in plane k in a-Si nanostructures, reaching
~3.0 and 5.3 W/m-K at 100 nm and 1.7 um, respectively. Furthermore, the
measured in plane k is significantly higher than the cross-plane k on the same
films. This usually high and anisotropic k in the amorphous Si nanostructures
manifests the surprising broad propaganda mean free path distribution, which is
found to range from 10 nm to 10 um, in the disordered and atomically isotropic
structure. This result provides an unambiguous answer to the century-old
problem regarding the mean free path distribution of propagons and also shed
light on the design and performance of numerous a-Si based electronic and

nonlocal light-cone correlations. They cannot be computed directly from Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). Using a standard lattice QCD approach, it is possible to
compute moments of PDFs, which are matrix elements of local operators.
Recently, an alternative approach has been proposed, based on the introduction
of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), which are matrix elements
of equal-time spatial correlations and hence calculable on lattice. Quasi-PDFs
approach standard PDFs in the limit of very large longitudinal proton momenta
$P^z$. This limit is not attainable in lattice simulations, and quasi-PDFs fail
to reproduce PDFs at high fractional longitudinal momenta. In this paper, we
propose a method to improve the reconstruction of PDFs by combining information
from quasi-PDFs and from the Mellin moments of regular PDFs. We test our method
using the diquark spectator model for up and down valence distributions of both
unpolarized and helicity PDFs. In the future, the method can be used to produce
PDFs entirely based on lattice QCD results.

we propose to describe images using short structured representations, aiming to
capture the crux of a description. These structured representations allow us to
tease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard
generalization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new

Attend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep

substantially better than the LSTM, ~7 times the accuracy of predicting

generalization for unseen combinations, we argue that structured
representations and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image

Lidov-Kozai cycles that cause a close pericenter passage, leading to a rapid
merger due to gravitational-wave emission. This scenario occurs most often for
systems in which the companion has mass comparable to the reduced mass of the
binary and the companion orbit has semi-major axis within a factor of $\sim 10$
of the binary semi-major axis. Using a simple population-synthesis model and
3-body simulations, we estimate the rate of mergers in triple black hole
systems in the field to be about six per Gpc$^3$ per year in the absence of
natal kicks during black hole formation. This value is within the low end of
the 90\% credible interval for the total black-hole black-hole merger rate
inferred from the current LIGO results. There are many uncertainties in these
calculations, the largest of which is the unknown distribution of natal kicks.
Even modest natal kicks of $40\mbox{km s}^{-1}$ will reduce the merger rate by
a factor of 40. A few percent of these systems will have eccentricity greater
than 0.999 when they first enter the frequency band detectable by aLIGO (above

positive eigenvalue of a certain hermitian observable, with the value
$0.0384517\dots$, or about $4\%$ of the total probability on the line. The
eigenvalue problem is now considered numerically in the more general case of
states with momentum restricted to the range $p_0<p<\infty$, for any given

monotonically, but never reaches $0$, as $p_0$ increases through positive
values; and it increases monotonically, but never reaches $1$, as $p_0$
decreases through negative values. Both of these effects are non-classical. The
results allow a simple interpretation of the classical limit, as an effective

  Positivity, integrality and the gluing formula","Version to appear in Geometry & Topology",,,,"math.AG math.SG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove three fundamental properties of counting holomorphic cylinders in
log Calabi-Yau surfaces: positivity, integrality and the gluing formula.
Positivity and integrality assert that the numbers of cylinders, defined via
virtual techniques, are in fact nonnegative integers. The gluing formula
roughly says that cylinders can be glued together to form longer cylinders, and
the number of longer cylinders equals the product of the numbers of shorter
cylinders. Our approach uses Berkovich geometry, tropical geometry, deformation
theory and the ideas in the proof of associativity relations of Gromov-Witten
invariants by Maxim Kontsevich. These three properties provide an evidence for
a conjectural relation between counting cylinders and the broken lines of
Gross-Hacking-Keel.

for Mg X, Ne VIII, Ne VI, O VI, Ne V, O V, Ne IV, O IV, N IV, O III, and H I.
Mg X, detected for the first time ($5.8 \sigma$), is a particularly direct
tracer of hot galactic halos, as its peak ion fraction occurs near
$10^{6.1}\rm~ K$, about the temperature of a virialized hot galaxy halo of mass
$\sim 0.5 M^*$. With Mg X and NeVIII, a photoionization model cannot reproduce
the observed column densities with path lengths of galaxy halos. For
collisional ionization models, one or two temperature models do not produce
acceptable fits, but a three temperature model or a power law model can produce
the observed results. In the power law model, ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}T = 10^{4.4\pm
2.2-[Z/X]} T^{1.55\pm 0.41}$ with temperatures in the range $10^{4.39\pm0.13}

$8.2 \times 10^{19} (0.3Z_{\odot}/Z) \rm~ cm^{-2}$ and the positive power law
index indicates most of the mass is at the high temperature end. We suggest
that this absorption system is a hot volume-filled galaxy halo rather than
interaction layers between the hot halo and cool clouds. The temperature
dependence of the column density is likely due to the local mixture of multiple

administrators by offering global visibility and network-wide control over the
switching infrastructure of the network. It is rather much difficult to obtain
the same benefits in the presence of middleboxes (MBs), due to (i) lack of a
proper topology discovery mechanism in environments with a mix of forwarding
devices and middleboxes. (ii) lack of generic APIs to abstract and gain control
on these rigid and heterogeneous third-party middleboxes (iii) lack of a
generic network infrastructure framework to monitor and verify any specific
device or path connectivity status in the network. These limitations make
automation of network operations such as, network-wide monitoring, policy
enforcement and rule-placement much difficult to handle. Hence, there is a
greater urge even from middlebox vendors, to better handle the control and
visibility aspects of the network in presence of middleboxes.
  In this paper, we propose a Unified network infrastructure framework for
gaining global network visibility, by discovering the network topology in the
presence of middleboxes, along with a framework to support the end-to-end path
connectivity verification, independent of SDN. We have also addressed security
aspects and provided necessary APIs to support our framework.

selective coupling to TE (TM) polarized WGMs. We formulate a new coupling
condition suitable for describing the case where the refractive indices of the
resonator and the coupler are almost the same, from which we derive the

our proposed method using a lithium niobate disk resonator coupled to a lithium

reasonably well characterized, but the evolution from a prestellar core to a
protostar is not well known, although the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) must be
a pivotal step. NGC 1333 IRAS 4C is a potentially very young object, that we
directly compare with the nearby Class 0 IRAS 4A and IRAS 4B. Observational
constraints are provided by spectral imaging from the JCMT Spectral Legacy
Survey (330-373 GHz) and continuum and line observations from CARMA. We present
integrated intensity and velocity maps of several species, including CO, H2CO
and CH3OH. The velocity of an observed outflow, the degree of CO depletion, the
deuteration of DCO+/HCO+ and gas kinetic temperatures are observational
signatures that we present. We report differences between the three sources in
four aspects: a) the kinetic temperature is much lower towards IRAS 4C, b) the
line profiles of the detected species show strong outflow activity towards IRAS
4A and IRAS 4B but not towards IRAS 4C, c) the HCN/HNC is < 1 towards IRAS 4C,
which confirms the cold nature of the source, d) the degree of CO depletion and
the deuteration are the lowest towards the warmest of the sources, IRAS 4B.
IRAS 4C seems to be in a different evolutionary state than the IRAS 4A and IRAS
4B sources. We can probably exclude the FHSC stage due to the relatively low
Lsmm/Lbol (~6\%) and we investigate the earliest accretion phase of Class 0
stage and the transition between Class 0 to Class I. Our results do not show a
consistent scenario for either case, with the major issue being the absence of
outflow activity and the cold nature of IRAS 4C. The number of FHSC candidates
in Perseus is ~10 times higher than current models predict, which suggests that
the lifespan of these objects is greater than 1000 years, possibly due to an
accretion rate lower than 4x10^-5 msun/yr.

effectively bridge the sematic gap in action recognition. To incorporate the
spatial-temporal cues for final representation, the STDV is used as the part of
graph regularization for NMF. The fusion of spatial-temporal information makes
the STANNCR more discriminative, and our fusion manner is more compact than
traditional method of concatenating vectors. The proposed approach is
extensively evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental results

sources is investigated. The model of this problem begins with a medium
consisting of a calorically perfect gas with a prescribed energy release per
unit mass. The energy release is collected into sheet-like sources that are now
embedded in an inert gas that fills the spaces between them. The release of
energy in the first sheet results in a planar blast wave that propagates to the
next source, which is triggered after a prescribed delay, generating a new
blast, and so forth. The resulting wave dynamics as the front passes through
hundreds of such sources is computationally simulated by numerically solving
the governing one-dimensional Euler equations in the lab-fixed reference frame.
The average wave speed for each simulation is measured once the wave
propagation has reached a quasi-periodic solution. Velocities in excess of the
CJ speed are found as the sources are made increasingly discrete, with the
deviation above CJ being as great as $15\%$. The total energy release, delay
time, and whether the sources remain lab-fixed or are convected with the flow
do not have a significant influence on the deviation of the average wave speed
away from CJ. Such continuous waves can also be shown to have a time-averaged
structure consistent with the classical ZND structure of a detonation. In the
limit of highly discrete sources, temporal averaging of the wave structure
shows that the effective sonic surface does not correspond to an equilibrium
state. The average state of the flow leaving the wave in this case does
eventually reach the equilibrium Hugoniot, but only after the effective sonic
surface has been crossed. Thus, the super-CJ waves observed in the limit of
highly discretized sources can be understood as weak detonations due to the
non-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface.

relay processing matrix, cognitive beamforming vector and power splitter are
jointly de- signed to maximize the rate of secondary users under the energy
causality constraint and the constraint that the demanded rate of primary users
is satisfied. For the perfect channel information state (CSI) case, by adopting
semi-definite relax (SDR) technique and Charnes-Cooper transformation, the
global optimal solution is given. To reduce the complexity, matrix
decomposition, zero forcing (ZF) scheme, and dual method are jointly employed
to derive a suboptimal solution. For the imperfect CSI case, S- procedure is
used to transform the worst-case robust problem into a tractable semi-definite

greatly preferred for both perfect and imperfect CSI cases when ST is close to

regulates the coupling of a given electron pair. sBGE2 correctly dissociates
H$_2$ and H$_2^+$, a problem that has been regarded as a great challenge in
density-functional theory for a long time. The sBGE2 functional is then taken
as a building block for an orbital-dependent functional, termed ZRPS, which is
a natural extension of the PBE0 hybrid functional. While worsening the good
performance of sBGE2 in H$_2$ and H$_2^{+}$, ZRPS yields a remarkable and
consistent improvement over other density functionals across various chemical
environments from weak to strong correlation.

independent signals to a stronger node R and a weaker node D. We focus on the
scenario that the direct link between S and D is too weak to meet the quality
of service (QoS) of D. Based on the NOMA principle, node R, the stronger user,
has prior knowledge about the information of the weaker user, node D. To
satisfy the targeted rate of D, R also serves as an EH decode-and-forward (DF)
relay to forward the traffic from S to D. In the sense of equivalent cognitive
radio concept, node R viewed as a secondary user assists to boost the
performance of D, in exchange for receiving its own information from S.
Specifically, transmitter beamforming design, power splitting ratio
optimization and receiver filter design to maximize node R rate are studied
with the predefined QoS constraint of D and the power constraint of S. Since
the problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative approach to solve it.
Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity, a zero- forcing (ZF) based
solution is also presented. Simulation results demonstrate that, both two

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
Because C is enriched and the elements heavier than Ba are not overabundant,
ET0097 can be classified as a CEMP-no star. However, this star shows
overabundances of lighter n-capture elements (i.e., Sr, Y and Zr). In this
work, having adopted the abundance decomposition approach, we investigate the
astrophysical origins of the elements in ET0097. We find that the light
elements and iron-peak elements (from O to Zn) of the star mainly originate
from the primary process of massive stars and the heavier n-capture elements
(heavier than Ba) mainly come from the main r-process. However, the lighter
n-capture elements such as Sr, Y and Zr should mainly come from the primary
weak s-process. The contributed fractions of the primary weak s-process to the
Sr, Y and Zr abundances of ET0097 are about 82%, 84% and 58% respectively,
suggesting that the CEMP star ET0097 should have the footprints of the weak

join mutually and form pairs of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The resulting symmetry
breaking creates gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes and play the role of
graviton tensor modes, which induce an attractive force between the $M1$ and
anti-$M1$ branes. Consequently, the gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes,
and the scalar fields which are attached symmetrically to all parts of these
branes, decay to fermions that attach anti-symmetrically to the upper and lower
parts of the branes, and hence the Pauli exclusion principle emerges. By
closing $M1$-branes mutually, the curvatures produced by parallel spins will be
different from the curvatures produced by anti-parallel spins, and this leads
to an inequality between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary
surface and the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk region. This behavior
is inherited in the $M3$-brane on which the universe is located, and hence this
leads to the emergence of the universe expansion and contraction. In this

globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in
each aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are
semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as
the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments show that our

  Examples","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1412.6572 by other authors",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have been shown to suffer from a surprising weakness:
their classification outputs can be changed by small, non-random perturbations
of their inputs. This adversarial example phenomenon has been explained as
originating from deep networks being ""too linear"" (Goodfellow et al., 2014). We
show here that the linear explanation of adversarial examples presents a number
of limitations: the formal argument is not convincing, linear classifiers do
not always suffer from the phenomenon, and when they do their adversarial
examples are different from the ones affecting deep networks.
  We propose a new perspective on the phenomenon. We argue that adversarial
examples exist when the classification boundary lies close to the submanifold
of sampled data, and present a mathematical analysis of this new perspective in
the linear case. We define the notion of adversarial strength and show that it
can be reduced to the deviation angle between the classifier considered and the
nearest centroid classifier. Then, we show that the adversarial strength can be
made arbitrarily high independently of the classification performance due to a
mechanism that we call boundary tilting. This result leads us to defining a new
taxonomy of adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial
strength observed in practice is directly dependent on the level of
regularisation used and the strongest adversarial examples, symptomatic of
overfitting, can be avoided by using a proper level of regularisation.

incompressible axisymmetric boundary layer on a circular cone. The base flow is
considered parallel to the axis of cone at the inlet. The angle of attack is
zero and hence the base flow is axisymmetric. The favorable pressure gradient
develops in the stream-wise direction due to cone angle. The Reynolds number is
calculated based on the cone radius (a) at the inlet and free-stream velocity
($U_{\infty}$). The base flow velocity profile is fully non-parallel and
non-similar. Linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNS) are derived for the
disturbance flow quantities in the spherical coordinates. The LNS are
discretized using Chebyshev spectral collocation method. The discretized LNS
along with the homogeneous boundary conditions forms a general eigenvalues
problem. Arnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the numerical solution of
the general eigenvalues problem. The Global temporal modes are computed for the
range of Reynolds number from 174 to 1046, semi-cone angles $2^o$, $4^o$, $6^o$
and azimuthal wave numbers from 0 to 5. It is found that the Global modes are
more stable at higher semi-cone angle $\alpha$, due to the development of
favorable pressure gradient. The effect of transverse curvature is reduced at
higher semi-cone angles ($\alpha$). The spatial structure of the eigenmodes
show that the flow is convectively unstable. The spatial growth rate ($A_x$)
increases with the increase in semi-cone angle ($\alpha$) from $2^o$ to $6^o$.
Thus, the effect of increase in semi-cone angle ($\alpha$) is to reduces the
temporal growth rate ($\omega_i$) and to increases the spatial growth rate
($A_x$) of the Global modes at a given Reynolds number.

Region. The observed jets show multi-thermal features. Their evolution shows
high consistence with the characteristic parameters of the emerging flux,
suggesting that with more free magnetic energy, the eruptions tend to be more
violent, frequent and blowout-like. The average temperature, average electron
number density and axial speed are found to be similar for different jets,
indicating that they should have been formed by plasmas from similar origins.
Statistical analysis of the jets and their footpoint region conditions reveals
a strong positive relationship between the footpoint-region total 131 {\AA}
intensity enhancement and jets' length/width. Stronger linearly positive
relationships also exist between the total intensity enhancement/thermal energy
of the footpoint regions and jets' mass/kinetic/thermal energy, with higher
cross-correlation coefficients. All the above results, together, confirm the
direct relationship between the magnetic reconnection and the jets, and
validate the important role of magnetic reconnection in transporting large
amount of free magnetic energy into jets. It is also suggested that there

minimizing an energy function that encodes object size priors, placement of
objects on the ground plane as well as several depth informed features that
reason about free space, point cloud densities and distance to the ground. We
then exploit a CNN on top of these proposals to perform object detection. In
particular, we employ a convolutional neural net (CNN) that exploits context
and depth information to jointly regress to 3D bounding box coordinates and
object pose. Our experiments show significant performance gains over existing
RGB and RGB-D object proposal methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark. When
combined with the CNN, our approach outperforms all existing results in object
detection and orientation estimation tasks for all three KITTI object classes.
Furthermore, we experiment also with the setting where LIDAR information is
available, and show that using both LIDAR and stereo leads to the best result.

artificial intelligence area. Recent approaches usually leverage neural
networks based on structure features such as syntactic or dependency features
to solve this problem. However, high-cost structure features make such
approaches inconvenient to be directly used. In addition, structure features
are probably domain-dependent. Therefore, this paper proposes a bi-directional
long-short-term-memory recurrent-neural-network (Bi-LSTM-RNN) model based on
low-cost sequence features to address relation classification. This model
divides a sentence or text segment into five parts, namely two target entities
and their three contexts. It learns the representations of entities and their
contexts, and uses them to classify relations. We evaluate our model on two
standard benchmark datasets in different domains, namely SemEval-2010 Task 8

comparable performance compared with other models using sequence features. In
the latter dataset, our model obtains the third best results compared with
other models in the official evaluation. Moreover, we find that the context
between two target entities plays the most important role in relation
classification. Furthermore, statistic experiments show that the context
between two target entities can be used as an approximate replacement of the
shortest dependency path when dependency parsing is not used.

smallest gap spacings, necessary to obtain regions of greatly enhanced electric
field, hotspots, which are critical to tailor light-matter interactions.
However, obtaining uniform electromagnetic response of dense nanoantennas over
large area for use in devices remains challenging. In this work,
electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow and chemical crosslinking is combined to form
dense, yet discrete, Au nanosphere clusters (oligomers) on a working electrode.
EHD provides a long range driving force to bring nanospheres together and
anhydride crosslinking yields 0.9 nm gap spacings. Using selective chemistry,
nanospheres are simultaneously crosslinked onto a block copolymer template,
producing oligomers with a narrower wavelength band width and higher hotspot
intensity than monolayer structures produced without a template. We investigate
nanoantenna response via full wave simulations, ultraviolet-visible
spectroscopy, and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Nanoantennas
exhibit uniform hotspot intensity and gap spacing. Simulations show field
enhancements of 600, correlating well with measured average SERS enhancement of
1.4x10^9. Nanoantenna substrates produce a SERS signal with a relative standard
deviation of 10% measured over a 1 mm2 area, crucial for nano-optical devices

  existence and relevance",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expecting events in time leads to more efficient behavior. A remarkable early
finding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on
reaction times; i.e., the influence or reaction time of the time period between
a warning signal and an imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to
respond as quickly as possible. Recently it has been shown that the phase of
oscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior.
Here we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect
on the inter-trial phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) triggered
by stimuli to which subjects are instructed not to respond. Inter-trial phase
coherence has been used to describe regularities in phases of groups of trials
time locked to an event of interest. We propose a single-trial measure of
inter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. Equipped with this
measure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we demonstrate that the
foreperiod duration in and audiovisual attention-shifting task modulates
single-trial phase coherence. In principle, this modulation could be an
artifact of the decoding method used to detect it. We show that this is not the
case, since the modulation can also be observed using a simple averaging
method. We show that the strength of this modulation correlates with subject
behavior (both error rates and mean-reaction times). We anticipate that the new
foreperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and the decoding method used
here to detect it, will be important tools to understand cognition at the
single-trial level. In Part II of this manuscript, we support this claim, by
showing that changes in attention modulate the strength of the new foreperiod
effect on a trial-by-trial basis.
