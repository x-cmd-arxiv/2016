if structured vegetation could have been detected in regions with abundant
photosynthetic pigments through the anisotropy of reflected shortwave

Sagan et al. (1993) noted a red edge in the reflectance spectrum, indicative of
photosynthesis) as the planet rotates to a common model of reflectance
anisotropy and found measured increase of surface reflectance of 0.019 versus a
0.007 predicted from only anisotropic effects. We hypothesize the difference
was due to minor cloud contamination. However, the Galileo dataset had only a
small change in phase angle (sun-satellite position) which reduced the observed
anisotropy signal and we demonstrate that theoretically if the probe had a
variable phase angle between 0-20, there would have been a much larger
predicted change in surface reflectance of 0.06 and under such a scenario
three-dimensional vegetation structure on Earth could possibly have been
detected. These results suggest that anisotropic effects may be useful to help
determine whether exoplanets have three-dimensional vegetation structure in the

propose two penalized $M$-estimation approaches for the estimation of the
covariance or scatter matrices under the broader assumption that they may
simply be close to each other, and hence roughly deviate from some positive
definite ""center"". The first approach begins by generating a pooled
$M$-estimator of scatter based on all the data, followed by a penalised
$M$-estimator of scatter for each group, with the penalty term chosen so that
the individual scatter matrices are shrunk towards the pooled scatter matrix.
In the second approach, we minimize the sum of the individual group
$M$-estimation cost functions together with an additive joint penalty term
which enforces some similarity between the individual scatter estimators, i.e.
shrinkage towards a mutual center. In both approaches, we utilize the concept
of geodesic convexity to prove the existence and uniqueness of the penalized
solution under general conditions. We consider three specific penalty functions
based on the Euclidean, the Riemannian, and the Kullback-Leibler distances. In
the second approach, the distance based penalties are shown to lead to
estimators of the mutual center that are related to the arithmetic, the
Riemannian and the harmonic means of positive definite matrices, respectively.
A penalty based on an ellipticity measure is also considered which is
particularly useful for shape matrix estimators. Fixed point equations are
derived for each penalty function and the benefits of the estimators are
illustrated in regularized discriminant analysis problem.

appropriate targets for the CARMENES exoplanet survey. Methods: We obtained
high-resolution images in the I band with the lucky imaging instrument FastCam
at the 1.5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez for 490 mid- to late-M dwarfs. For all
the detected binaries, we measured angular separations, position angles, and
magnitude differences in the I band. We also calculated the masses of each
individual component and estimated orbital periods, using the available
magnitude and colour relations for M dwarfs and our own MJ-spectral type and
mass-MI relations. To avoid biases in our sample selection, we built a
volume-limited sample of M0.0-M5.0 dwarfs that is complete up to 86% within 14
pc. Results: From the 490 observed stars, we detected 80 companions in 76
systems, of which 30 are new discoveries. The multiplicity fraction in our
observed sample is 16.7+-2.0% . In our volume-limited sample it is 19.5+-2.3%
for angular separations of 0.2 to 5.0 arcsec (1.4-65.6 au), The distribution of
the projected physical separations peaks at 2.5-7.5 au. For M0.0-M3.5 V
primaries, our search is sensitive to mass ratios higher than 0.3. Binaries
with projected physical separations shorter than 50 au tend to be of equal
mass. For 26 of our systems, we estimated orbital periods shorter than 50 a, 10
of which are presented here for the first time. We measured variations in
angular separation and position angle that are due to orbital motions in 17 of
these systems. The contribution of binaries and multiples with angular
separations shorter than 0.2 arcsec, longer than 5.0 arcsec, and of
spectroscopic binaries identified from previous searches, although not
complete, may increase the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs in our
volume-limited sample to at least 36%.

excitations can give rise to a pronounced asymmetry in the phonon line shape,

systems, such as stripe-phase nickelates, graphene and high-$T_{c}$
superconductors. Here, we reveal explicit evidence for strong coupling between
an infrared-active $A_1$ phonon and electronic transitions near the Weyl points
(Weyl fermions) through the observation of a Fano resonance in the recently
discovered Weyl semimetal TaAs. The resultant asymmetry in the phonon line
shape, conspicuous at low temperatures, diminishes continuously as the
temperature increases. This anomalous behavior originates from the suppression
of the electronic transitions near the Weyl points due to the decreasing
occupation of electronic states below the Fermi level ($E_{F}$) with increasing
temperature, as well as Pauli blocking caused by thermally excited electrons
above $E_{F}$. Our findings not only elucidate the underlying mechanism
governing the tunable Fano resonance, but also open a new route for exploring
exotic physical phenomena through the properties of phonons in Weyl semimetals.

  Journal",,"10.3847/0004-637X/832/1/9",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At present, Babcock-Leighton flux transport solar dynamo models appear as the
most promising model for explaining diverse observational aspects of the
sunspot cycle. The success of these flux transport dynamo models is largely
dependent upon a single-cell meridional circulation with a deep equatorward
component at the base of the Sun's convection zone. However, recent
observations suggest that the meridional flow may in fact be very shallow
(confined to the top 10 % of the Sun) and more complex than previously thought.
Taken together these observations raise serious concerns on the validity of the
flux transport paradigm. By accounting for the turbulent pumping of magnetic
flux as evidenced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection, we
demonstrate that flux transport dynamo models can generate solar-like magnetic
cycles even if the meridional flow is shallow. Solar-like periodic reversals is
recovered even when meridional circulation is altogether absent, however, in
this case the solar surface magnetic field dynamics does not extend all the way
to the polar regions. Very importantly, our results demonstrate that the
Parker-Yoshimura sign rule for dynamo wave propagation can be circumvented in
Babcock-Leighton dynamo models by the latitudinal component of turbulent
pumping -- which can generate equatorward propagating sunspot belts in the
absence of a deep, equatorward meridional flow. We also show that variations in
turbulent pumping coefficients can modulate the solar cycle amplitude and
periodicity. Our results suggest the viability of an alternate magnetic flux
transport paradigm -- mediated via turbulent pumping -- for sustaining
solar-stellar dynamo action.

due to the users' level of engagement. For instance, low engagement users may
make random choices with no concern for the quality of items offered. This
biased choice data can corrupt estimates of user preferences for items.
However, one can correct for these biases if additional behavioral data is
utilized. To do this we construct a new choice engagement time model which
captures the impact of user engagement on choice decisions and response times
associated with these choice decisions. Response times are the behavioral data
we choose because they are easily measured by online applications and reveal
information about user engagement. To test our model we conduct online polls
with subject populations that have different levels of engagement and measure
their choice decisions and response times. We have two main empirical findings.
First, choice decisions and response times are correlated, with strong
preferences having faster response times than weak preferences. Second, low
user engagement is manifested through more random choice data and faster
response times. Both of these phenomena are captured by our choice engagement
time model and we find that this model fits the data better than traditional
choice models. Our work has direct implications for online applications. It
lets these applications remove the bias of low engagement users when estimating
preferences for items. It also allows for the segmentation of users according
to their level of engagement, which can be useful for targeted advertising or

adapt existing finite difference schemes to robustly estimate parametric

chooses the most appropriate simulation method for the network of interest. Our
method is tested for functionality and accuracy in a range of different

duration. They are usually driven by planar undulators, meaning that the output
radiation is linearly polarized. For many experimental applications, however,
polarization control is critical: besides the ability to produce linearly
polarized radiation, one often needs the possibility of generating circularly
polarized radiation with a high, stable degree of polarization. This may be
achieved by using a first part of the XFEL undulator to produce bunching and
then, by propagating the the bunched beam through an ""afterburner"" - a short
undulator with tunable polarization, where only limited gain takes place. One
of the issues that one needs to consider in this case is the separation of the
circularly polarized radiation obtained in the radiator from the linearly
polarized background produced in the first part of the FEL. In this article we
review several methods to do so, including the inverse tapering technique. In
particular, we use the Genesis FEL code to simulate a case study pertaining to
the SASE3 FEL line at the European XFEL with up-to-date parameters and we
confirm that a high degree of circular polarization is expected. Moreover, we
propose to further improve the effectiveness of the inverse tapering technique
either via angular separation of the linearly polarized radiation or strongly
defocusing it at the sample position. In this way we exploit the unique
flexibility of the European XFEL from both the electron beam and the photon
beam optics side.

effects introduce a systematic error for any study. This error can relate to
misleading results;specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction
in the efficacy of text mining classification results. Objective: To provide a
method in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used
for further analysis. Method: We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering
tool that tunes LDA's parameters using DE (Differential Evolution). LDADE is
evaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow),
title and abstract text of thousands ofSoftware Engineering (SE) papers, and
software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different
implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark); across different
platforms (Linux, Macintosh) and for different kinds of LDAs (VEM,or using
Gibbs sampling). Results were scored via topic stability and text mining
classification accuracy. Results: In all treatments: (i) standard LDA exhibits
very large topic instability; (ii) LDADE's tunings dramatically reduce cluster
instability; (iii) LDADE also leads to improved performances for supervised as
well as unsupervised learning. Conclusion: Due to topic instability, using
standard LDA with its ""off-the-shelf"" settings should now be depreciated. Also,
in future, we should require SE papers that use LDA to test and (if needed)
mitigate LDA topic instability. Finally, LDADE is a candidate technology for
effectively and efficiently reducing that instability.

resampling step of a standard particle filter by a linear transformation which
allows for a hybridization of particle filters with ensemble Kalman filters and
renders the resulting hybrid filters applicable to spatially extended systems.
However, the linear transformation step is computationally expensive and leads
to an underestimation of the ensemble spread for small and moderate ensemble
sizes. Here we address both of these shortcomings by developing second-order
accurate extensions of the ETPF. These extensions allow one in particular to
replace the exact solution of a linear transport problem by its Sinkhorn
approximation. It is also demonstrated that the nonlinear ensemble transform
filter (NETF) arises as a special case of our general framework. We illustrate
the performance of the second-order accurate filters for the chaotic Lorenz-63

improvements can be achieved in comparison to a standard ensemble Kalman filter

Independently, we identified a noteworthy, young Shell Galaxy (SG) system

SGs are rare in galaxy clusters, and indeed, a simple estimate yields that they

Drawing on parabolic inf-sup theory, we first construct a left preconditioner

be solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. We then prove
that the transformed system can be further preconditioned by an ideal block
diagonal preconditioner, leading to a condition number bounded by 4 for any

electronics by encoding the information into spin degrees of freedom. Although
beneficial for transmitting information with minimal losses when compared to

information propagation in a spin(tronic) network is challenging due to its

exhibits a complex self-similar structure (where subgraphs repeat to some

develop a new box counting inspired algorithm which assesses the mono-fractal

finite networks, multi-fractality is further compounded by ""engineering"" or
""biasing"" the network for selective transfer, as selectivity makes the network
more heterogeneous. To demonstrate criticality in finite size systems, we
define a thermodynamics inspired framework for describing information

transition in Anderson localization in finite media.}

displacements is an increasingly attractive and valuable information in
biomedical experiments. The computation of these tractions requires in general
the solution of an inverse problem. Here, we resort to the discretisation with
finite elements of the associated direct variational formulation, and solve the
inverse analysis using a least square approach. This strategy requires the
minimisation of an error functional, which is usually regularised in order to
obtain a stable system of equations with a unique solution. In this paper we
show that for many common three-dimensional geometries, meshes and loading
conditions, this regularisation is unnecessary. In these cases, the
computational cost of the inverse problem becomes equivalent to a direct finite
element problem. For the non-regularised functional, we deduce the necessary
and sufficient conditions that the dimensions of the interpolated displacement
and traction fields must preserve in order to exactly satisfy or yield a unique
solution of the discrete equilibrium equations. We apply the theoretical
results to some illustrative examples and to real experimental data. Due to the
relevance of the results for biologists and modellers, the article concludes
with some practical rules that the finite element discretisation must satisfy.

internal motion inside a rigid case. Because the motor case motion exhibits
rotational symmetry, when placed into a fluid such as glycerin, the motor does
not swim even though its vibrations induce steady streaming in the fluid.
However, a piece of rubber foam stuck to the curved case and giving the motor
neutral buoyancy also breaks the rotational symmetry allowing it to swim. We
measured a 1 cm diameter coin vibrational motor swimming in glycerin at a speed
of a body length in 3 seconds or at 3 mm/s. The swim speed puts the vibrational
motor in a low Reynolds number regime similar to bacterial motility, but
because of the vibration it is not analogous to biological organisms. Rather
the swimming vibrational motor may inspire small inexpensive robotic swimmers
that are robust as they contain no external moving parts. A time dependent
Stokes equation planar sheet model suggests that the swim speed depends on a
steady streaming velocity $V_{stream} \sim Re_s^{1/2} U_0$ where $U_0$ is the
velocity of surface vibrations, and streaming Reynolds number $Re_s =

pulsar found in data from the ongoing Arecibo PALFA pulsar survey. The pulsar
is in a 4.95-hr double neutron star (DNS) system with an eccentricity of 0.089.
From radio timing with the Arecibo 305-m telescope, we measure the rate of
advance of periastron to be 5.632(18) deg/yr. Assuming general relativity
accurately models the orbital motion, this corresponds to a total system mass
of 2.875(14) solar masses, similar to the mass of the most massive DNS known to
date, B1913+16, but with a much smaller eccentricity. The small eccentricity
indicates that the second-formed neutron star (the companion of PSR J1913+1102)
was born in a supernova with a very small associated kick and mass loss. In
that case this companion is likely, by analogy with other systems, to be a
light (1.2 solar mass) neutron star; the system would then be highly
asymmetric. A search for radio pulsations from the companion yielded no
plausible detections, so we can't yet confirm this mass asymmetry. By the end
of 2016, timing observations should permit the detection of two additional
post-Keplerian parameters: the Einstein delay, which will enable precise mass
measurements and a verification of the possible mass asymmetry of the system,
and the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves, which will
allow another test of the radiative properties of gravity. The latter effect
will cause the system to coalesce in ~0.5 Gyr.

via radiative emission at the high-density interface of the turbulent eddies,
stimulating a top-down condensation cascade of warm, $10^4$ K filaments. The
ionized (optical/UV) filaments extend up to several kpc and form a skin
enveloping the neutral filaments (optical/IR/21-cm). The peaks of the warm
filaments further condense into cold molecular clouds (<50 K; radio) with total
mass up to several $10^7$ M$_\odot$, i.e., 5/50$\times$ the neutral/ionized
masses. The multiphase structures inherit the chaotic kinematics and are
dynamically supported. In the inner 500 pc, the clouds collide in inelastic
way, mixing angular momentum and leading to chaotic cold accretion (CCA). The
BHAR can be modeled via quasi-spherical viscous accretion with collisional mean
free path ~100 pc. Beyond the inner kpc region pressure torques drive the
angular momentum transport. In CCA, the BHAR is recurrently boosted up to 2 dex
compared with the disc evolution, which arises as turbulence is subdominant.
The CCA BHAR distribution is lognormal with pink noise power spectrum
characteristic of fractal phenomena. The rapid self-similar CCA variability can
explain the light curve variability of AGN and HMXBs. An improved criterium to
trace thermal instability is proposed. The 3-phase CCA reproduces crucial
observations of cospatial multiphase gas in massive galaxies, as Chandra X-ray

of the scatter in the stellar mass - halo mass relation for central galaxies.
We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic
simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation.
The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo
mass. At $z = 0.1$ it declines from 0.25 dex at $M_{200, \rm DMO} \approx
10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ to 0.12 dex at $M_{200, \rm DMO} \approx 10^{13}$
M$_{\odot}$, but the trend is weak above $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. For $M_{200,
\rm DMO} < 10^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to
scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass
corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher
concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion
and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with
higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, $V_{\rm max, DMO}$, and
binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass,
meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide
fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration
alone cannot explain the total scatter in the $M_{\rm star} - M_{200, \rm DMO}$
relation, and it does not explain the scatter in $M_{\rm star} -V_{\rm max,
DMO}$. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are
also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more
complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.

spectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a
much higher [OIII]/[OII] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By
comparing their distributions on a [OIII]/[OII] versus R23 diagram, we
demonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower
metallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using
measures of H-beta and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of
our LAEs, that xi_ion - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity
- is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts.
Using photoionization models we estimate the effect this would have on both
[OIII]/[OII] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially
explain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a
large [OIII]/[OII] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound
nebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons.
We discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly
LAEs with intense [OIII] emission represent a promising analog of those z>7

AGNs, and the rest (44) are type II AGNs. The time scales probed in this work
are among the longest for X-ray variability studies of distant AGNs.
Photometric analyses reveal widespread photon-flux variability: $90\%$ of AGNs
are variable above a 95% confidence level, including many X-ray obscured AGNs
and several optically classified type II quasars. We characterize the intrinsic
X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm{X}}$) and absorption ($N_{\rm{H}}$) variability via
spectral fitting. Most (74%) sources show $L_{\rm{X}}$ variability; the
variability amplitudes are generally smaller for quasars. A Compton-thick
candidate AGN shows variability of its high-energy X-ray flux, indicating the
size of reflecting material to be $\lesssim 0.3$ pc. $L_{\rm{X}}$ variability
is also detected in a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. The $N_{\rm{H}}$
variability amplitude for our sample appears to rise as time separation
increases. About 16% of sources show $N_{\rm{H}}$ variability. One source
transitions from an X-ray unobscured to obscured state while its optical
classification remains type I; this behavior indicates the X-ray eclipsing
material is not large enough to obscure the whole broad-line region.

evolution of the global alignment of particles measured by the order parameter
$\varphi$, until complete order $\varphi=1.0$ is reached (polar consensus). We

exponentially fast to $1.0$ for long times. Also, the mean time to consensus
$\tau$ varies non-monotonically with the density of particles $\rho$, reaching
a minimum at some intermediate density $\rho_{\tiny \mbox{min}}$. At
$\rho_{\tiny \mbox{min}}$, the mean consensus time scales with the system size

faster than in the case of all-to-all interactions (large $\rho$) where

functions in solids, is often used to characterize inversion-symmetric 1D
topological insulators; however, since its value can depend on the choice of
real-space origin and unit cell, only the difference between the Zak phase of
two regions is believed to be relevant. Here, we show that one can extract an
origin-independent part of $\gamma$, the so-called inter-cellular Zak phase
$\gamma^{\mathrm{inter}}$, which can be used as a bulk quantity to predict the
number of surface modes as follows: a neutral finite 1D tight-binding system
has $n_s = \gamma^{\mathrm{inter}}/\pi$ (mod 2) number of in-gap surface modes
below the Fermi level if there exists a commensurate bulk unit cell that
respects inversion symmetry. We demonstrate this by first verifying that $\pm
e\gamma^{\mathrm{inter}}/2\pi$ (mod $e$) is equal to the extra charge
accumulation in the surface region for a general translationally invariant 1D
insulator, while the remnant part of $\gamma$, the intra-cellular Zak phase
$\gamma^{\mathrm{intra}}$, corresponds to the electronic part of the dipole
moment of the bulk's unit cell. Second, we show that the extra charge
accumulation can be related to the number of surface modes when the unit cell
is inversion symmetric. This bulk-boundary correspondence using
$\gamma^{\mathrm{inter}}$ reduces to the conventional one using $\gamma$ when
the real-space origin is at the inversion center. Our work thereby clarifies
the usage of $\gamma$ in the bulk-boundary correspondence. We study several
tight binding models to quantitatively check the relation between the extra
charge accumulation and the inter-cellular Zak phase as well as the

clustered multiplex networks for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-like
dynamics. The model is intended to understand diffusion of influence, or any
other spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of
interconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed
to be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model,
where each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may
depend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being
spread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions,
probability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis
provides a generalization of previous approaches and is specially useful in
problems related to spreading and percolation. The results present non trivial
dependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average
degree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending
on these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing
clustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size,
however this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain
average degree from which on clustering favours the probability and size of the
contagion. By comparing the dynamics of complex contagions over multiplex
networks and their monoplex projections, we demonstrate that ignoring link
types and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about
contagion dynamics, particularly when the correlation of degrees between layers
is high.

the total mass within $1\,R_{\rm e}$, and $67\% \pm 10\%$ within $6\,R_{\rm

tangentially anisotropic, the blue GCs are mildly radially anisotropic, and the
PNe vary from radially to tangentially anisotropic from the inner to the outer

anisotropy of the red GCs in the inner regions could stem from the preferential
destruction of red GCs on more radial orbits, while their outer tangential
anisotropy -- similar to the PNe in this region -- has no good explanation. The

over previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are
included directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids
loss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard
cuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical
properties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and
kinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a
metal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry,
our approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of $\gamma =
0.5 \pm 0.3$. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with
$\beta_r^{red} = 0.0\pm0.1$) while the metal-poor population is tangentially
anisotropic (with $\beta_r^{blue} = -0.2\pm0.1$) around the half light radius
of $0.26$ kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is
revealed with $v_{max}/\sigma_0 = 0.15 \pm 0.15$. We run tests using mock data
to show that a discrete dataset with $\sim 6000$ stars is required to
distinguish between a core ($\gamma = 0$) and cusp ($\gamma = 1$), and to
constrain the possible internal rotation to better than $1\,\sigma$ confidence
with our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling
technique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the
internal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a
stellar system.

detailed systematic study of the effects of resolution and clump clustering on

measure clump diameters spanning the range $d_{clump} \sim 100-800$~pc, and
individual clump star formation rates as high as $\sim5$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$.
DYNAMO clumps have very high SFR surface densities, $\Sigma_{SFR}\sim
15$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$, $\sim100\times$ higher than in H{\sc ii}
regions of nearby spirals. Indeed, SFR surface density provides a simple
dividing line between massive star forming clumps and local star forming
regions, where massive star forming clumps have $\Sigma_{SFR}>
0.5$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$. When degraded to match the observations
of galaxies in $z\sim 1-3$ surveys, DYNAMO galaxies are similar in morphology
and measured clump properties to clumpy galaxies observed in the high-$z$
Universe. Emission peaks in the simulated high-redshift maps typically
correspond to multiple clumps in full resolution images. This clustering of
clumps systematically increases the apparent size and SFR of clumps in 1~kpc
resolution maps, and decreases the measured SFR surface density of clumps by as
much as a factor of 20$\times$. From these results we can infer that clump
clustering is likely to strongly effect the measured properties of clumps in
high-$z$ galaxies, which commonly have kiloparsec scale resolution.

to the potential in the galaxy's inner region, giving the disc enough self
gravity for bar modes to grow. After bar formation there is significant mass
redistribution, creating a baryon dominated inner and dark matter dominated
outer disc. This implies that, unlike most other low surface brightness

spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain coupled to a tight-binding chain via two competing
Kondo exchange couplings of different type: a ""s-wave"" Kondo coupling
($J^s_{K}$), and a less common ""p-wave"" ($J^p_{K}$) Kondo coupling. While the
first coupling is the standard Kondo interaction studied in many
condensed-matter systems, the latter has been recently introduced by Alexandrov

a topological Kondo-insulating ground state in one dimension. As a result of
this competition, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) occurs in the
system for a critical value of the ratio $J^s_{K}/J^p_{K}$, separating a
(Haldane-type) topological phase from a topologically trivial ground state
where the system can be essentially described as a product of local singlets.
We study and characterize the TQPT by means for the magnetization profile, the

reasons, macroscopic drops of liquid are nearly spherical away from interfaces
with solids, and any local deformations due to molecular-scale surface
interactions are negligible. Studies of wetting phenomena, therefore, typically
assume that a liquid on a surface adopts the shape of a spherical cap. The
degree of wettability is then captured by the contact angle where the
liquid-vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. As droplet volumes
shrink to the scale of attoliters, however, surface interactions become
significant, and droplets gradually assume distorted shapes that no longer
comply with our conventional, macroscopic conception of a drop. In this regime,
the contact angle becomes ambiguous, and it is unclear how to parametrize a
liquid's affinity for a surface. A scalable metric for quantifying wettability
is needed, especially given the emergence of technologies exploiting
liquid-solid interactions at the nanoscale. Here we combine nanoscale
experiments with molecular-level simulation to study the breakdown of spherical
droplet shapes at small length scales. We demonstrate how measured droplet
topographies increasingly reveal non-spherical features as volumes shrink, in
agreement with theoretical predictions. Ultimately, the nanoscale liquid
flattens out to form layer-like molecular assemblies, instead of droplets, at
the solid surface. For the lack of a consistent contact angle at small scales,
we introduce a droplet's adsorption energy density as a new metric for a
liquid's affinity for a surface. We discover that extrapolating the macroscopic
idealization of a drop to the nanoscale, though it does not geometrically
resemble a realistic droplet, can nonetheless recover its adsorption energy if
line tension is properly included.

that are compatible with long-period brown dwarf companions.The orbital

have a wide range in orbital periods, eccentricities, and companion masses. For
the binaries with restricted orbital solutions, we find a range of orbital
periods of between $\sim$ 97-1600 days and eccentricities of between $\sim$
0.1-0.4. In addition, we studied the metallicity distribution of single and
binary giant stars. We computed the metallicity of a total of 395 evolved
stars, 59 of wich are in binary systems. We find a flat distribution for these
binary stars and therefore conclude that stellar binary systems, and
potentially brown dwarfs, have a different formation mechanism than
planets.This result is confirmed by recent works showing that extrasolar
planets orbiting giants are more frequent around metal-rich stars. Finally, we
investigate the eccentricity as a function of the orbital period. We analyzed a
total of 130 spectroscopic binaries, including those presented here and systems
from the literature. We find that most of the binary stars with periods
$\lesssim$ 30 days have circular orbits, while at longer orbital periods we

to get a better understanding of the inner workings of SPNs; secondly, we seek
additional ways to evaluate one SPN model and compare it against other
probabilistic models, providing diagnostic tools to practitioners; lastly, we
want to empirically evaluate how good and meaningful the extracted

order to do so we revise their interpretation as deep neural networks and we
propose to exploit several visualization techniques on their node activations
and network outputs under different types of inference queries. To investigate
these models as feature extractors, we plug some SPNs, learned in a greedy
unsupervised fashion on image datasets, in supervised classification learning
tasks. We extract several embedding types from node activations by filtering
nodes by their type, by their associated feature abstraction level and by their
scope. In a thorough empirical comparison we prove them to be competitive
against those generated from popular feature extractors as Restricted Boltzmann

probabilistic marginal queries as means to compare other tractable
probabilistic models on a common ground, extending our experiments to Mixtures

step towards developing such models: we show how uniform modules of excitatory

exposed to input in the form of population codes, learns the input encodings as
well as the relationships between the inputs. STDP learning rules lead the
modules to self-organize into a relational network, which is able to infer
missing inputs,restore noisy signals, decide between conflicting inputs, and
combine cues to improve estimates. These networks show that it is possible for
a homogeneous network of spiking units to self-organize so as to provide

The nanoparticle was modeled as a dimer made by one monomer that interacts by a
standard Lennard Jones potential and another monomer that is modeled using a
two-length scale shoulder potential. This specific design of nanoparticle
exhibits in bulk distinct self-assembled structures and water-like diffusion
anomaly. Our results indicate that besides the aggregates observed in bulk, new
structures are observed under confinement. Also, the dynamic and thermodynamic

a well-ordered basis such that T sends each vector in that basis to the

polynomial f that factors into linear terms, (3) there is a maximal
well-ordered set of subspaces of V that are invariant under T, (4) T can be put
into a crude version of the Jordan canonical form. We also show that any finite

triangularizable, we describe the closure of the set of triangularizable

brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies whose atomic hydrogen is the main component of
their baryonic matter. Therefore, observations of void galaxy HI are mandatory
in order to understand their evolution and dynamics.
  Aims. Our aim was to obtain integrated HI parameters for a fainter part of
the nearby Lynx-Cancer void galaxy sample (total of 45 objects) with the Nancay
Radio Telescope (NRT) and to conduct the comparative analysis of all the 103
void galaxies with known HI data with a sample of similar galaxies residing in
denser environments of the Local Volume.
  Methods. For HI observations we used the NRT with its sensitive
antenna/receiver system FORT and standard processing. The comparison of the
void and control samples on the parameter M(HI)/L_B is conducted with the
non-parametric method `The 2x2 Contingency Table test'.
  Results. We obtained new HI data for about 40% of the Lynx-Cancer galaxy
sample. Along with data from the literature, we use these new data for further
analysis of 103 void objects. The proxy of the evolutional parameter M(HI)/L_B
of the void sample is compared with that of 82 galaxies of morphological types
8--10 residing in the Local Volume (LV) groups and aggregates.
  Conclusions. At the confidence level of P = 0.988, we conclude that for the
same luminosity, these void galaxies are systematically gas-richer, on average
by ~39%. This result is consistent with the authors' earlier conclusion on the
smaller gas metallicities and evidence for the slower low-mass galaxy evolution
in voids.

in data analytics and scientific computing. The rapid growth in the size of
matrices further increases the need for developing efficient large-scale SVD
algorithms. Randomized SVD based on one-time sketching has been studied, and
its potential has been demonstrated for computing a low-rank SVD. Instead of
exploring different single random sketching techniques, we propose a Monte
Carlo type integrated SVD algorithm based on multiple random sketches. The
proposed integration algorithm takes multiple random sketches and then
integrates the results obtained from the multiple sketched subspaces. So that
the integrated SVD can achieve higher accuracy and lower stochastic variations.
The main component of the integration is an optimization problem with a matrix
Stiefel manifold constraint. The optimization problem is solved using
Kolmogorov-Nagumo-type averages. Our theoretical analyses show that the
singular vectors can be induced by population averaging and ensure the
consistencies between the computed and true subspaces and singular vectors.
Statistical analysis further proves a strong Law of Large Numbers and gives a
rate of convergence by the Central Limit Theorem. Preliminary numerical results
suggest that the proposed integrated SVD algorithm is promising.

various wettabiities is studied. The morphology and free energy of a
lens-shaped droplet are determined from the minimum of the free energy. The
effect of line tension on the free energy is also studied. Then, the
equilibrium contact angle of the droplet is determined from the generalized
Young's equation. By increasing the droplet volume within the spherical cavity,
the droplet morphology changes from spherical with an equilibrium contact angle
of $180^{\circ}$ to a lens with a convex meniscus, where the morphological
complete drying transition occurs. By further increasing the droplet volume,
the meniscus changes from convex to concave. Then, the lens-shaped droplet with
concave meniscus spreads over the whole inner wall resulting in an equilibrium
contact angle of $0^{\circ}$ to leave a spherical bubble, where the
morphological complete wetting transition occurs. Finally, the whole cavity is
filled with liquid. The free energy shows a barrier from complete drying to
complete wetting as a function of droplet volume, which corresponds to the
energy barrier between the Cassie and Wenzel state of the superhydrophobic
surface with spherical cavities. The free-energy maximum occurs when the
meniscus of the droplet becomes flat and it is given by an analytic formula.
The effect of line tension is expressed by the scaled line tension, and this
effect is largest at the free-energy maximum. The positive line tension
increases the free-energy maximum, which thus, increases the stability of the
Cassie superhydrophobic state, whereas the negative line tension destabilizes
the superhydrophobic state.

(on-line) a robust energy storage scheduling that minimizes the imbalance for a
particular balancing group considering the demand prediction uncertainty. The
group formation is performed by a Probabilistic Programming approach using
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method after applied on the historical

real applications it is often required that the photons have a well-defined

exponential pulse is able to fully excite a two-level atom while a Gaussian
pulse cannot. This motivates the study of continuous-mode single-photon Fock
states. Such states are characterized by a spectral (or temporal) pulse shape.
In this paper we investigate the statistical property of continuous-mode
single-photon Fock states. Instead of the commonly used normal ordering (Wick
order), the tool we proposed is the Wigner spectrum. The Wigner spectrum has
two advantages: 1) it allows to study continuous-mode single-photon Fock states
in the time domain and frequency domain simultaneously; 2) because it can deal
with the Dirac delta function directly, it has the potential to provide more
information than the normal ordering where the Dirac delta function is always
discarded. We also show how various control methods in particular coherent
feedback control can be used to manipulate the pulse shapes of continuous-mode
single-photon Fock states.

evolutionary ecology. For continuous time models in which individuals disperse
throughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal
strategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable
in spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,
however, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less
commonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and
dispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,
rather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new
mathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for
continuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is
identified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita
growth rates for individuals in all patches is equal to zero, or (ii)
individuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while
individuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The
first possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second
possibility corresponds to a ""source-sink"" spatial structure. We prove that
populations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution
displace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial
structure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population,
ideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show
that these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal
strategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal
or breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in
spatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.

we directly calculate the linear thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of a

The TEC calculation depends critically on the evaluation of a
temperature-dependent quantity $I_i(T)$, which is the integral of the product
of heat capacity and $\Gamma_i(\nu)$, of frequency $\nu$ and strain type $i$,
where $\Gamma_i(\nu)$ is the phonon density of states weighted by the
Gr\""uneisen parameters. We show that to determine the linear TECs we may use
minimally two uniaxial strains in the $z$ direction, and either the $x$ or $y$
direction. However, a uniaxial strain in either the $x$ or $y$ direction
drastically reduces the symmetry of the crystal from a hexagonal one to a
base-centered orthorhombic one. We propose to use an efficient and accurate
symmetry-preserving biaxial strain in the $xy$ plane to derive the same result
for $\Gamma(\nu)$. We highlight that the Gr\""uneisen parameter associated with
a biaxial strain may not be the same as the average of Gr\""uneisen parameters
associated with two separate uniaxial strains in the $x$ and $y$ directions due
to possible preservation of degeneracies of the phonon modes under a biaxial
deformation. Large anisotropy of TECs is observed where the linear TEC in the
$c$ direction is about $1.8$ times larger than that in the $a$ or $b$ direction
at high temperatures. Our theoretical TEC results are compared with experiment.
The symmetry-preserving approach adopted here may be applied to a broad class
of two lattice-parameter systems such as hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal
systems, which allows many complicated systems to be treated on a
first-principles level.

variational collapse by using a variance-based, unconstrained local

graphs have been studied extensively in the context of crossing number
problems. We consider a natural class of simple topological drawings of
complete bipartite graphs, in which we require that one side of the vertex set
bipartition lies on the outer boundary of the drawing.
  We investigate the combinatorics of such drawings. For this purpose, we
define combinatorial encodings of the drawings by enumerating the distinct
drawings of subgraphs isomorphic to $K_{2,2}$ and $K_{3,2}$, and investigate
the constraints they must satisfy. We prove that a drawing of $K_{k,n}$ exists
if and only if some simple local conditions are satisfied by the encodings.
This directly yields a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the existence of
such a drawing given the encoding. We show the encoding is equivalent to
specifying which pairs of edges cross, yielding a similar polynomial-time
algorithm for the realizability of abstract topological graphs.
  We also completely characterize and enumerate such drawings of $K_{k,n}$ in
which the order of the edges around each vertex is the same for vertices on the

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(also known as drones) also offer tremendous amount of
videos, mostly with top-down or oblique view-point. Egocentric vision and
top-view surveillance videos have been studied extensively in the past in the
computer vision community. However, the relationship between the two has yet to

formalize the problem in a way which handles and also estimates the unknown
relative time-delays between the egocentric videos and the top-view video. We
formulate the problem as a spectral graph matching instance, and jointly seek
the optimal assignments and relative time-delays of the videos. As a result, we
spatiotemporally localize the egocentric observers in the top-view video. We
model each view (egocentric or top) using a graph, and compute the assignment

information among different views are usually beneficial to various tasks,

based on the fact that the multi-view data are generated from a latent

stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms that rely on spectral properties
of the data covariance. As a consequence we can relate questions pertaining to
speedups and convergence rates for distributed SGD to the data distribution
instead of the regularity properties of the objective functions. More precisely
we show that this rate depends on the spectral norm of the sample covariance
matrix. An estimate of this norm can provide practitioners with guidance
towards a potential gain in algorithm performance. For example many sparse
datasets with low spectral norm prove to be amenable to gains in distributed
settings. Towards establishing this data dependence we first study a
distributed consensus-based SGD algorithm and show that the rate of convergence
involves the spectral norm of the sample covariance matrix when the underlying
data is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (homogenous).
This dependence allows us to identify network regimes that prove to be
beneficial for datasets with low sample covariance spectral norm. Existing
consensus based analyses prove to be sub-optimal in the homogenous setting. Our
analysis method also allows us to find data-dependent convergence rates as we
limit the amount of communication. Spreading a fixed amount of data across more
nodes slows convergence; in the asymptotic regime we show that adding more
machines can help when minimizing twice-differentiable losses. Since the
mini-batch results don't follow from the consensus results we propose a
different data dependent analysis thereby providing theoretical validation for
why certain datasets are more amenable to mini-batching. We also provide
empirical evidence for results in this thesis.

quantities and indices in the polar regions during the recent few decades, the
spatial correlations in sea ice velocity fields are of particular interest. It
is thus natural to ask; ""how persistent are these correlations?"" To this end, a
multi-fractal stochastic treatment is developed to analyze observed Arctic sea
ice velocity fields from satellites and buoys for the period 1978 - 2015.
Having previously found that the Arctic Equivalent Ice Extent (EIE) has a white
noise structure on annual to bi-annual time scales, the connection between EIE
and ice motion is assessed. The long-term stationarity of the spatial
correlation structure of the velocity fields, and the robustness of their white
noise structure on multiple time scales is demonstrated, which (a) combine to
explain the white noise characteristics of the EIE on annual to biannual time
scales, and (b) explain why the fluctuations in the ice velocity are
proportional to fluctuations in the geostrophic winds on time scales of days to
months. Moreover, it is shown that the statistical structure of these two
quantities is commensurate from days up to years, which may be related to the

  Biophysics and Physicobiology",,,,"q-bio.BM cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple statistical mechanical model proposed by Wako and Sait$\hat{\rm o}$
has explained the aspects of protein folding surprisingly well. This model was
systematically applied to multiple proteins by Mu$\tilde{\rm n}$oz and Eaton
and has since been referred to as the Wako-Sait$\hat{\rm o}$-Mu$\tilde{\rm
n}$oz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the
folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is
dominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally
biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models,
Sait$\hat{\rm o}$ emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in
protein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having
a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these
segments. The $\phi$-values calculated for barnase with the WSME model
suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the
structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME
model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex
topology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding
process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe
allosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does
not occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as
a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape.
Statistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model,
has been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will
continue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.

information world and society in recent years. The requirement of
collecting,storing, processing, and sharing of the Big Data has led to massive
software resources being developed and made accessible as web-based services to
facilitate such process. These services that handle the Big Data come from
various domains and heterogeneous networks, and converge into a huge
complicated service network (or ecosystem), called the Big Service.The key
issue facing the big data and big service ecosystem is how to optimally
configure and operate the related service resources to serve the specific
requirements of possible applications, i.e., how to reuse the existing service
resources effectively and efficiently to develop the new applications or
software services, to meet the massive individualized requirements of
end-users.Based on analyzing the big service ecosystem, we present in this
paper a new paradigm for software service engineering, RE2SEP
(Requirement-Engineering Two-Phase of Service Engineering Paradigm), which
includes three components: service-oriented requirement engineering,
domain-oriented service engineering, and software service development approach.
RE2SEP enables the rapid design and implementation of service solutions to
match the requirement propositions of massive individualized customers in the
Big Service ecosystem. A case study on people's mobility service in a smart
city environment is given to demonstrate the application of RE2SEP.RE2SEP can
potentially revolutionize the traditional life-cycle oriented software
engineering, leading to a new approach to software service engineering.

terahertz range is considered. The corrected formula for the graphene quantum
conductivity is found. The obtained formula gives complex conjugate results
when radiation polarization direction is clockwise or it is opposite clockwise.
The found formula allows us to see that the graphene membrane is an oscillating
contour. Its eigen frequency coincides with a singularity point of the
conductivity and depends on the electrons concentration. So the graphene
membrane could be used as an antenna or a transistor and its eigen frequency
could be tuned by doping in a large terahertz-infrared frequency range. The
obtained formula allows us also to calculate the graphene membrane quantum
inductivity and capacitance. The found dependence on electrons concentration is
consistent with experiments. The method of the proof is based on the study of
the time-dependent density matrix. The exact solution of the von Neumann
equation for density matrix is found for our case in linear approximation on
the external field. On this basis the induced current is studied and then the
formula for quantum conductivity as a function of external field frequency and
temperature is obtained. The method of the proof suggested in this paper could
be used to study other problems. The found formula for quantum conductivity can
be used to correct the SPPs Dispersion Relation and for the description of

rotation curves in the Milky Way and spiral galaxies. We then describe two
major methods to calculate the mass distribution using the rotation curve. By
the direct method, the mass is calculated from rotation velocities without
employing mass models. By the decomposition method, the rotation curve is
deconvolved into multiple mass components by model fitting assuming a black
hole, bulge, exponential disk and dark halo. The decomposition is useful for
statistical correlation analyses among the dynamical parameters of the mass
components. We also review recent observations and derived results.

at validating the performance of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
formulation in which gradients are derived from an integral approach. We
specifically investigate the code behavior with subsonic flows, where it is
well known that zeroth-order inconsistencies present in standard SPH make it
particularly problematic to correctly model the fluid dynamics. In particular
we consider the Gresho-Chan vortex problem, the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities, the statistics of driven subsonic turbulence and the cold
Keplerian disc problem. We compare simulation results for the different tests
with those obtained, for the same initial conditions, using standard SPH. We
also compare the results with the corresponding ones obtained previously with
other numerical methods, such as codes based on a moving-mesh scheme or
Godunov-type Lagrangian meshless methods. We quantify code performances by
introducing error norms and spectral properties of the particle distribution,
in a way similar to what was done in other works. We find that the new SPH
formulation exhibits strongly reduced gradient errors and outperforms standard
SPH in all of the tests considered. In fact, in terms of accuracy we find good
agreement between the simulation results of the new scheme and those produced
using other recently proposed numerical schemes. These findings suggest that
the proposed method can be successfully applied for many astrophysical problems
in which the presence of subsonic flows previously limited the use of SPH, with
the new scheme now being competitive in these regimes with other numerical
methods.

was suggested to overcome the effect of the large penetration of gamma
radiation. The feasibility studies in the case of brain tumors and abdominal
neuro-endocrine tumors were based on simulations starting from PET images with
several underlying assumptions. This paper reports, as proof-of-principle of
this technique, an ex-vivo test on a meningioma patient. This test allowed to
validate the whole chain, from the evaluation of the SUV of the tumor, to the
assumptions on the bio-distribution and the signal detection.
  Methods: A patient affected by meningioma was administered 300 MBq of
90Y-DOTATOC. Several samples extracted from the meningioma and the nearby Dura
Mater were analyzed with a beta- probe designed specifically for this
radio-guided surgery technique. The observed signals were compared both with
the evaluation from the histology and with the Monte Carlo simulation.
  Results: we obtained a large signal on the bulk tumor (105 cps) and a
significant signal on residuals of $\sim$0.2 ml (28 cps). We also show that
simulations predict correctly the observed yields and this allows us to
estimate that the healthy tissues would return negligible signals (~1 cps).
This test also demonstrated that the exposure of the medical staff is
negligible and that among the biological wastes only urine has a significant
activity.
  Conclusions: This proof-of-principle test on a patient assessed that the
technique is feasible with negligible background to medical personnel and
confirmed that the expectations obtained with Monte Carlo simulations starting
from diagnostic PET images are correct.

this paper, we deal with classes of sources over an infinite alphabet, that are
characterized by a dominating envelope. We provide asymptotic equivalents for
the redundancy of envelope classes enjoying a regular variation property. We
finally construct a computationally efficient online prefix code, which
interleaves the encoding of the so-called pattern of the message and the

previously described contenders. In contrast with previous attempts, it also
covers the full range of slowly varying envelope classes.

both on the magnitude ($B_{loc}$) and the direction ($\theta$, relative to the

$I_c(B_a,\theta)$, where $B_a$ is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field.
However, for applications where the superconducting materials experience a

consider in this paper are, in general, in non-product form and are of interest
in applied problems as they arise in Bayesian nonparametric statistics and in
the study of conditioned diffusions. Furthermore, we study the situation, which
arises in practice, where the algorithm is started out of stationarity. We
thereby significantly extend previous works which consider either only measures
of product form, when the Markov chain is started out of stationarity, or
measures defined via a density with respect to a Gaussian, when the Markov
chain is started in stationarity. We prove that, in the non-stationary regime,
the computational cost of the algorithm is of the order N^(1/2) with dimension,
as opposed to what is known to happen in the stationary regime, where the cost
is of the order N^(1/3).

investigated and the contribution to the emission due to the stellar wind
acceleration region and clumping of the wind is quantified. Building upon
established theory, a method for calculating the thermal radio and sub-mm
emission using results for a line-driven stellar outflow according to Castor,
Abbott & Klein (1975) is presented. The results show strong variation of the
spectral index for 10 2 GHz < {\nu} < 10 4 GHz. This corresponds both to the
wind acceleration region and clumping of the wind, leading to a strong
dependence on the wind velocity law and clumping parameters. The Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) is the first observatory to have both the
spectral window and sensitivity to observe at the high frequencies required to
probe the acceleration regions of massive stars. The deviations in the
predicted flux levels as a result of the inclusion of the wind acceleration
region and clumping are sufficient to be detected by ALMA, through deviations
in the spectral index in different portions of the radio/sub-mm spectra of
massive stars, for a range of reasonable mass-loss rates and distances.
Consequently both mechanisms need to be included to fully understand the
mass-loss rates of massive stars.

time-varying directed graphs. A practical way of dealing with large-scale
networks is to reduce their dimension by collapsing the states of nodes
belonging to densely and intensively connected clusters into aggregate
variables. It will be shown that under suitable conditions, the states of the
agents in each cluster converge fast toward a local agreement. Local agreements
correspond to aggregate variables which slowly converge to consensus. Existing
results concerning the time-scale separation in large networks focus on fixed
and undirected graphs. The aim of this work is to extend these results to the
more general case of time-varying directed topologies. It is noteworthy that in
the fixed and undirected graph case the average of the states in each cluster
is time-invariant when neglecting the interactions between clusters. Therefore,
they are good candidates for the aggregate variables. This is no longer
possible here. Instead, we find suitable time-varying weights to compute the
aggregate variables as time-invariant weighted averages of the states in each
cluster. This allows to deal with the more challenging time-varying directed
graph case. We end up with a singularly perturbed system which is analyzed by
using the tools of two time-scales averaging which seem appropriate to this
system.

and ensuring that only users authorized by the policy are able to decrypt the

using this secret and publicly available information. Recent work has
challenged this approach by developing schemes, based on a chain partition of
the information flow policy, that do not require public information for key
derivation, the trade-off being that a user may need to be assigned more than
one secret. In general, many different chain partitions exist for the same
policy and, until now, it was not known how to compute an appropriate one.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a tree partition, of which chain
partitions are a special case. We show how a tree partition may be used to
define a cryptographic enforcement scheme and prove that such schemes can be
instantiated in such a way as to preserve the strongest security properties
known for cryptographic enforcement schemes. We establish a number of results
linking the amount of secret material that needs to be distributed to users
with a weighted acyclic graph derived from the tree partition. These results
enable us to develop efficient algorithms for deriving tree and chain

  anesthesia effects","48 pages, 11 Figures",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005511",,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The disruption of coupling between brain areas has been suggested as the
mechanism underlying loss of consciousness in anesthesia. This hypothesis has
been tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain
areas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling.
Yet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available
in the information source-such that transfer decreases even for unchanged
coupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we asked whether
impaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer.
An important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in
locally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced
as changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by recording
local field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in
concentrations of 0.0 %, 0.5 %, and 1.0 %.
  We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1
and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-as predicted by our alternative hypothesis. The
decrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC. Information transfer between V1
and PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to
V1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger
decrease in source entropy, suggesting reduced source entropy reduces
information transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic
targets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the
synapses formed by interareal axonal projections. Thus, changes in information
transfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local
processing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We suggest that source
entropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information
transfer as decoupling.

investigated open clusters were compared with the ratios predicted by stellar

NGC 2477 agree well with the first dredge-up and thermohaline-induced
extra-mixing models, which are similar for intermediate turn-off mass stars.

the spectra, we are able to classify 100 of the 108 targets as quasars. A large
fraction (50 %) is observed to have broad absorption lines (BALs). Moreover, we
find 6 quasars with strange breaks in their spectra, which are not consistent
with regular dust reddening. Using template fitting we infer the amount of
reddening along each line of sight ranging from A(V)$\approx$0.1 mag to 1.2 mag
(assuming an SMC extinction curve). In four cases, the reddening is consistent
with dust exhibiting the 2175{\AA} feature caused by an intervening absorber,
and for two of these, a MgII absorption system is observed at the best-fit
absorption redshift. In the rest of the cases, the reddening is most likely
intrinsic to the quasar. We observe no evidence for dusty DLAs in this survey.
However, the large fraction of BAL quasars hampers the detection of absorption
systems. Out of the 50 non-BAL quasars only 28 have sufficiently high redshift

available pilots than users, hence at each slot the scheduler needs to decide
an allocation of pilots to users with the goal of maximizing the long-term

focus on the comparison of metrics built on the citation count with
network-based metrics. We contrast five article-level metrics with respect to
the rankings that they assign to a set of fundamental papers, called Milestone
Letters, carefully selected by the APS editors for ""making long-lived
contributions to physics, either by announcing significant discoveries, or by
initiating new areas of research"". A new metric, which combines PageRank
centrality with the explicit requirement that paper score is not biased by
paper age, is the best-performing metric overall in identifying the Milestone
Letters. The lack of time bias in the new metric makes it also possible to use
it to compare papers of different age on the same scale. We find that
network-based metrics identify the Milestone Letters better than metrics based
on the citation count, which suggests that the structure of the citation
network contains information that can be used to improve the ranking of
scientific publications. The methods and results presented here are relevant

from the case of the lowest breathing mode whose excitation consists of a
single frequency ($2\omega_z$) in both regimes. Our predictions for the dipole
compression mode open promising perspectives for the experimental investigation
of collisional effects in 1D configurations.

slowly on the scale of the driving period. The analysis is based on a general
formulation of the Floquet theory relying on the extended Hilbert space. It is
shown that the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a slowly
varying effective Floquet Hamiltonian that captures the long-term evolution, as
well as rapidly oscillating micromotion operators. We obtain a systematic
high-frequency expansion of all these operators. Generalizing the previous
studies, the expanded effective Hamiltonian is now time-dependent and contains
extra terms appearing due to changes in the periodic driving. The same applies
to the micromotion operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in
addition to the rapid oscillations. As an illustration, we consider a
quantum-mechanical spin in an oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing
direction. The effective evolution of the spin is then associated with
non-Abelian geometric phases reflecting the geometry of the extended Floquet
space. The developed formalism is general and also applies to other
periodically driven systems, such as shaken optical lattices with a
time-dependent shaking strength, a situation relevant to the cold atom
experiments.

objects using data from the RoboPol blazar monitoring program and the Nordic
Optical Telescope. We wish to understand if there are differences in the BL Lac
objects that are detected with the current-generation TeV instruments compared
to those that have not yet been detected. The mean polarization fraction of the
TeV-detected BL Lacs is 5% while the non-TeV sources show a higher mean
polarization fraction of 7%. This difference in polarization fraction
disappears when the dilution by the unpolarized light of the host galaxy is
accounted for. The TeV sources show somewhat lower fractional polarization
variability amplitudes than the non-TeV sources. Also the fraction of sources
with a smaller spread in the Q/I - U/I -plane and a clumped distribution of
points away from the origin, possibly indicating a preferred polarization
angle, is larger in the TeV than in the non-TeV sources. These differences
between TeV and non-TeV samples seems to arise from differences between
intermediate and high spectral peaking sources instead of the TeV detection.
When the EVPA variations are studied, the rate of EVPA change is similar in
both samples. We detect significant EVPA rotations in both TeV and non-TeV
sources, showing that rotations can occur in high spectral peaking BL Lac
objects when the monitoring cadence is dense enough. Our simulations show that
we cannot exclude a random walk origin for these rotations. These results
indicate that there are no intrinsic differences in the polarization properties
of the TeV-detected and non-TeV-detected high-energy BL Lac objects. This
suggests that the polarization properties are not directly related to the
TeV-detection, but instead the TeV loudness is connected to the general flaring
activity, redshift, and the synchrotron peak location. (Abridged)

proposed Gegenbauer-based Nystr\""om numerical method for the

wireless communication systems must be designed with strict constraints on the

state estimation, which allows the transmitter to adapt the code rate to the
channel. In this work, we characterize the trade-off between the estimation
sequence length and data codeword length: shorter channel estimation leaves
more time for the actual payload transmission but reduces the estimation
accuracy and causes more decoding errors. Using lower coding rates can mitigate
this effect, but may result in a higher backlog of data at the transmitter. We
analyze this trade-off using queueing analysis on top of accurate models of the
physical layer, which also account for the finite blocklength of the channel
code. Based on a novel closed-form approximation for the error probability
given the rate, we show that finding the optimal rate adaptation strategy
becomes a convex problem. The optimal rate adaptation strategy and the optimal
training sequence length, which both depend on the latency and reliability
constraints of the application, can improve the delay performance by an order
of magnitude, compared to suboptimal strategies that do not consider those
constraints.

self-consistent framework that we employed in order to discuss the dynamics of
the theories of interest. Its merit lies in that we can make the symmetry group
act internally and thus be effectively separated from coordinate
transformations. We investigate under which conditions it is not needed to
introduce extra compensating fields to make relativistic as well as
nonrelativistic theories invariant under local symmetries and more precisely
under scale transformations. We clarify the role that torsion plays in this
context. We highlight the difference between Weyl and conformal invariance and
we demonstrate that not all conformal theories can be coupled to gravity in a
Weyl invariant way. Once this minimalistic treatment for gauging symmetries is
left aside, new possibilities appear. Namely, if we consider the Poincar\'e
group, the presence of the extra modes leads to nontrivial particle dynamics.
We derive constraints such that the theory is free from pathologies. In the
second part we make clear that even when not gauged, the presence of scale
invariance is appealing. First, it makes possible for the dimensionful
parameters that appear in a theory to be generated dynamically and be sourced
by the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton. If the Standard Model is
embedded into a scale-invariant framework, a number of interesting implications
for cosmology arise. The inflationary stage of our Universe and its present-day
acceleration become linked, a connection that might give us insight into the
dark energy dynamics. We show that in the context of gravitational theories
which are invariant under restricted coordinate transformations, the dilaton
instead of being introduced ad hoc, can emerge from the gravitational part of a
theory. We discuss the consequences of the nontrivial way this field emerges in
the action.

particles on substrates). This approach is equally applicable to cases where
the crystal surface energy is isotropic, weakly anisotropic, strongly
anisotropic and ""cusped"". We demonstrate that, unlike in the classical
Winterbottom approach, multiple equilibrium island shapes may be possible when
the surface energy is strongly anisotropic. We analyze these shapes through
perturbation analysis, by calculating the first and second variations of the
total free energy functional with respect to contact locations and island
shape. Based on this analysis, we find the necessary conditions for stable
equilibria and exploit this through a generalization of the Winterbottom
construction to identify all possible stable equilibrium shapes. Finally, we
propose a dynamical evolution method based on surface diffusion mass transport
to determine whether all of the stable equilibrium shapes are dynamically
accessible. Applying this approach, we demonstrate that islands with different
initial shapes may evolve into different stationary shapes and show that these
dynamically-determined stationary states correspond to the predicted stable

networking paradigm. While OpenFlow and its match-action concept provide
primitive operations to manipulate hardware configurations, over the last

developed. This paper presents WNetKAT, the first network programming language
accounting for the fact that networks are inherently weighted, and
communications subject to capacity constraints (e.g., in terms of bandwidth)
and costs (e.g., latency or monetary costs). WNetKAT is based on a syntactic
and semantic extension of the NetKAT algebra. We demonstrate several relevant
applications for WNetKAT, including cost- and capacity-aware reachability, as
well as quality-of-service and fairness aspects. These applications do not only
apply to classic, splittable and unsplittable (s; t)-flows, but also generalize
to more complex network functions and service chains. For example, WNetKAT
allows to model flows which need to traverse certain waypoint functions, which
may change the traffic rate. This paper also shows the relation between the
equivalence problem of WNetKAT and the equivalence problem of the weighted
finite automata, which implies undecidability of the former. However, this
paper also succeeds to prove the decidability of another useful problem, which
is sufficient in many practical scnearios: whether an expression equals to 0.

causal interpretation of the exposure-outcome association, but up to now few
studies explicitly faced this issue within a causal inference framework. In
this paper, we reformulated the problem of assessing the short term impact of
air pollution on health using the potential outcome approach to causal
inference. We focused on the impact of high daily levels of PM10 on mortality
within two days from the exposure in the metropolitan area of Milan (Italy),
during the period 2003-2006. After defining the number of attributable deaths
in terms of difference between potential outcomes, we used the estimated
propensity score to match each high exposure-day with a day with similar
background characteristics but lower PM10 level. Then, we estimated the impact
by comparing mortality between matched days. We found that during the study
period daily exposures larger than 40 microgram per cubic meter were
responsible of 1079 deaths (116; 2042). The impact was more evident among the
elderly than in the younger classes of age. The propensity score matching
turned out to be an appealing method to assess historical impacts in this
field.

used the tie-points to carry out a photogrammetric block adjustment, which
improves the image pointing and the accuracy of (3D) ground points from about
850 m to approximately 55 m. Subsequently, we applied high density

Benefitting from improved image pointing data, we compute about 6.3 billion

The comparison of the DEM with the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) tracks
obtained over 4 years of MESSENGER operation reveals that the DEM is
geometrically very rigid. It may be used as a reference to identify MLA
outliers (when MLA operating at ranging limit) or to map offsets of laser

answer because they neglect the influence of the crust. I propose here the
first model of dissipative tides in a subsurface ocean, by combining the
Laplace Tidal Equations with the membrane approach. For the first time, it is
possible to compute tidal dissipation rates within the crust, ocean, and mantle
in one go. I show that oceanic dissipation is strongly reduced by the crustal
constraint, and thus contributes little to Enceladus' present heat budget.
Tidal resonances could have played a role in a forming or freezing ocean less
than 100 m deep. The model is general: it applies to all icy satellites with a
thin crust and a shallow ocean. Scaling rules relate the resonances and
dissipation rate of a subsurface ocean to the ones of a surface ocean. If the
ocean has low viscosity, the westward obliquity tide does not move the crust.
Therefore, crustal dissipation due to dynamical obliquity tides can differ from
the static prediction by up to a factor of two.

continuum emission in 5 out of the 10 objects (RXJ1615, UX Tau A, LkCa15,
RXJ1633, and SR24s). In the case of LkCa15, the centimeter emission is
extended, and has a similar morphology to that of the transitional disk
observed at mm wavelengths with an inner depression. For these five detections,
we construct the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from the centimeter to
submillimeter wavelengths, and find that they can be well fitted with a single
(RXJ 1633 and UX Tau A) or a two component power-law (LkCa 15, RXJ 1615, and
SR24s). For the cases where a single power-law fits well the data, the
centimeter emission is likely produced by optically thin dust with large grains
i.e. centimeter-size pebbles) present in the transitional disks. For the cases
where a double power-law fits the data, the centimeter emission might be
produced by the combination of photoevaporation and/or a free-free jet. We
conclude that RXJ1633 and UX Tau A are excellent examples of transitional disks

studied. In the other cases, some other physical emitting mechanisms are also
important in the centimeter regime.

evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts
of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security
components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these
individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of
potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks
and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights
which factors and security components contribute most to a component's
difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in
which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a
series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the
attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying
important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated.
The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems
designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that

  systems perspective","8 pages 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Species or population that proliferate faster than others become dominant in
numbers. Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to
dominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the
available substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of
sets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical
backbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by
organisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the
stability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be
reshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this
paper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary
selection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics
become predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence
large reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic
instabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple
mathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a
statistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable
dynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict
evolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell
differentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here
is that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how
to differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For
example, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will
evolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not
larger than the number of suppressors.

splitting, merging, emergence and cancellation of magnetic fields to the
rearrangement, addition and removal of magnetic flux in the photosphere. We
employ a statistical approach for the analysis and the evolution studies are
carried out using a feature tracking technique. In this paper we provide a
detailed description of the feature tracking algorithm that we have newly
developed and we present the results of a statistical study of several physical
quantities. The results on the fractions of the flux in the emergence,
appearance, splitting, merging, disappearance and cancellation qualitatively
agrees with other recent studies. To summarize, the total flux gained in
unipolar appearance is an order of magnitude larger than the total flux gained
in emergence. On the other hand, the bi-polar cancellation contributes nearly
an equal amount to the loss of magnetic flux as unipolar disappearance. The
total flux lost in cancellation is nearly $6-8$ times larger than the total
flux gained in emergence. One big difference between our study and previous
similar studies is that thanks to the higher spatial resolution of Sunrise we
can track features with fluxes as low as $9\times10^{14}$ Mx. This flux is
nearly an order of magnitude lower than the smallest fluxes of the features

of a single unit, starting with elementary mean-field approximations, either
static or dynamic, that describe a unit embedded in a 'self-consistent'

to account for spatial dependences, in the form of space-dependent mean-field
Fokker-Planck equations for example. We also briefly review the use of kinetic
theory in the framework of the Boltzmann equation, which is an appropriate
description for dilute systems. We then turn to descriptions in terms of the

models, using a Matrix Product Ansatz method when correlations are present.
Since exactly solvable models are scarce, we also present some approximation
methods that can be used to determine the $N$-body distribution in a large
system of dissipative units. These methods include the Edwards approach for
dense granular matter and the approximate treatment of multiparticle Langevin
equations with coloured noise, which models systems of self-propelled
particles. Throughout this review, emphasis is put on methodological aspects of
the statistical modeling and on formal similarities between different physical
problems, rather than on the specific behaviour of a given system.

finitely many ideals of $\langle B \rangle$ with given finite index. Thus, the

models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling
(ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and
enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic
networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical,
empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding

agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this
research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting
the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation
diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely

standardize ABM methodology, we identify four major issues in model calibration

multidimensional auction for allocating the tasks of a job among nearby mobile
nodes based on their computational capabilities and also the cost of
computation at these nodes, with the goal of reducing the overall job
completion time. Our proposed auction also has the desired incentive
compatibility property that ensures that mobile devices truthfully reveal their
capabilities and costs and that those devices benefit from the task allocation.
To deal with node mobility, we perform multiple auctions over adaptive time
intervals. We develop a heuristic approach to dynamically find the best time
intervals between auctions to minimize unnecessary auctions and the
accompanying overheads. We evaluate our framework and methods using both real
world and synthetic mobility traces. Our evaluation results show that our game
theoretic framework improves the job completion time by a factor of 2-5 in
comparison to the time taken for executing the job locally, while minimizing
the number of auctions and the accompanying overheads. Our approach is also
profitable for the nearby nodes that execute the distributor's tasks with these
nodes receiving a compensation higher than their actual costs.

decelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant
broadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower
decline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy
is generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.

significant boost in the optical light curve is observed. We discuss these
findings in particular in the context of the super-luminous event SN 2009dc. As
our calculations are able to reproduce a number of its peculiar properties, we
conclude that the flavour of the interaction scenario investigated in this work
constitutes a promising candidate to explain such 'Super-Chandrasekhar'
supernovae.

process continues, desired result is obtained by solving always determinants of
second order. It also assesses the degree of efficiency compared to the method
by minors and with the method of Gauss, as well as the ability to reflect small
variations in the data. This method should have a good impact also in the area
of teaching mathematics, due to its ease of assimilation and application.

  Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2016)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of layering general directed graphs under height and
possibly also width constraints. Given a directed graph G = (V,A) and a maximal
height, we propose a layering approach that minimizes a weighted sum of the
number of reversed arcs, the arc lengths, and the width of the drawing. We call
this the Compact Generalized Layering Problem (CGLP). Here, the width of a
drawing is defined as the maximum sum of the number of vertices placed on a
layer and the number of dummy vertices caused by arcs traversing the layer. The
CGLP is NP-hard. We present two MIP models for this problem. The first one
(EXT) is our extension of a natural formulation for directed acyclic graphs as
suggested by Healy and Nikolov. The second one (CGL) is a new formulation based
on partial orderings. Our computational experiments on two benchmark sets show
that the CGL formulation can be solved much faster than EXT using standard
commercial MIP solvers. Moreover, we suggest a variant of CGL, called MML, that
can be seen as a heuristic approach. In our experiments, MML clearly improves
on CGL in terms of running time while it does not considerably increase the
average arc lengths and widths of the layouts although it solves a slightly
different problem where the dummy vertices are not taken into account.

  Neural Networks","4 pages",,"10.1109/LCA.2017.2656880",,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the most successful deep
machine learning technologies for processing image, voice and video data. CNNs
require large amounts of processing capacity and memory, which can exceed the
resources of low power mobile and embedded systems. Several designs for
hardware accelerators have been proposed for CNNs which typically contain large
numbers of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) units. One approach to reducing data sizes
and memory traffic in CNN accelerators is ""weight sharing"", where the full
range of values in a trained CNN are put in bins and the bin index is stored
instead of the original weight value. In this paper we propose a novel MAC
circuit that exploits binning in weight-sharing CNNs. Rather than computing the
MAC directly we instead count the frequency of each weight and place it in a
bin. We then compute the accumulated value in a subsequent multiply phase. This
allows hardware multipliers in the MAC circuit to be replaced with adders and
selection logic. Experiments show that for the same clock speed our approach
results in fewer gates, smaller logic, and reduced power.

proposed in the literature to explain the apparent spontaneous selection - out
of the many mathematically eligible bases - of a privileged measurement basis
that corresponds to what we actually observe. This paper describes such
processes, and demonstrates that - contrary to common belief - no such process
can actually lead to a preferred basis in general. The key observation is that
environment induced decoherence implicitly assumes a prior independence of the
observed system, the observer and the environment. However, such independence
cannot be guaranteed, and we show that environment induced decoherence does not
succeed in establishing a preferred measurement basis in general. We conclude
that the existence of the preferred basis must be postulated in quantum
mechanics, and that changing the basis for a measurement is, and must be,
described as an actual physical process.

behavior of the model to a single metric function. By assuming a physically
viable form for the $g_{rr}$ metric potential we obtain an exact solution of
the Einstein field equations which is free from any singularities and satisfies
all the physical criteria. We utilize this solution to predict the masses and

Physics Review",,,,"physics.plasm-ph astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wave propagation in the partially ionized ionosphere plays an important
role in the magnetosphere ionosphere coupling. For example, the ionosphere may
supports very low-frequency Alfven wave which can be caused by a balance
between the bulk fluid inertia (mostly due to neutrals in the lower and middle
E region) and the deformation of the magnetic field. The plasma neutral
collisional momentum exchange facilitates the transfer of the magnetic stress
(felt directly by the ions) to the neutrals. Therefore, in the low-frequency
(with respect to the neutral ion collision frequency) limit, waves through the
ionosphere can propagate with very little damping. In the vanishing plasma
inertia limit, waves can be excited due to the loading of neutral inertia on
the field lines and thus may have very long wavelength and can easily couple to
the magnetosphere. The frequency of these waves are below few Hz.
