inverse magnetocaloric effect (IMCE) is observed below 260 K while conventional
magnetocaloric effect (CMCE) above it. The exponent m is found to be
independent of temperature and field only in the IMCE region. Investigation of

Multiferroic behavior is found to persist in Dy0.4Ln0.6Fe0.5Cr0.5O3 (Ln= Er and
Gd). There is an evidence for magnetoelectric coupling in all these materials
with qualitative differences in its behavior as the temperature is changed
across these two transitions. Remnant electric polarization is observed for all

seen to get enhanced as a result of rare-earth substitution with respect to

the interior and the periphery of fibril bundles, indicating an effectively
constant rate of collagen incorporation into fibrils throughout the bundle.
Such spatially homogeneous incorporation constrains the extracellular diffusion
of collagen precursors from sources at the bundle boundary to sinks at the
growing fibrils. With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine
stringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental
measurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after
birth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays
below the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the
combination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to
ensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower
concentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen
using conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent
concentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses
from the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and
subsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase
is localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar
growth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to
fully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous
fibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.

disks. Owing to the preferential formation of stars in stellar clusters, the
protoplanetary disks around these stars may potentially be affected by the
cluster environment. Various works have investigated the influence of stellar
fly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to
parabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very
special case. We perform numerical simulations to study the fate of
protoplanetary disks after the impact of parabolic star-disk encounter for the
less investigated case of inclined up to coplanar, retrograde encounters, which
is a much more common case. Here, we concentrate on the disk size after such
encounters because this limits the size of the potentially forming planetary
systems. In addition, with the possibilities that ALMA offers, now a direct
comparison to observations is possible. Covering a wide range of periastron
distances and mass ratios between the mass of the perturber and central star,
we find that despite the prograde, coplanar encounters having the strongest
effect on the disk size, inclined and even the least destructive retrograde
encounters mostly also have a considerable effect, especially for close
periastron passages. Interestingly, we find a nearly linear dependence of the
disk size on the orbital inclination for the prograde encounters, but not for
the retrograde case. We also determine the final orbital parameters of the
particles in the disk such as eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major
axes. Using this information the presented study can be used to describe the
fate of disks and also that of planetary systems after inclined encounters.

galaxy pairs selected by K_s magnitude and redshift. The pairs represent the
two populations of spiral-spiral (S+S) and mixed morphology spiral-elliptical
(S+E). The CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) is used to fit dust
models to the 2MASS, WISE and Herschel flux density measurements and derive the
parameters describing the PAH contribution, interstellar radiation field (ISRF)
and photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). Model fits verify our previous Spitzer
Space Telescope analysis that S+S and S+E pairs do not have the same level of
enhancement of star formation and differ in dust composition. The spirals of
mixed morphology galaxy pairs do not exhibit the enhancements in interstellar
radiation field and therefore dust temperature for spirals in S+S pairs in
contrast to what would be expected according to standard models of gas
redistribution due to encounter torques. This suggests the importance of the
companion environment/morphology in determining the dust properties of a spiral
galaxy in a close major-merger pair.

discrete time Markov process in $\mathbb{Z}^{N}$ obtained from a collection of
$N$ independent simple random walks with steps $\in\{0,1\}$ by conditioning
that they never collide. We study the asymptotic behavior of local statistics
of this process started from an arbitrary initial configuration on short times
$T\ll N$ as $N\to+\infty$. We show that if the particle density of the initial
configuration is bounded away from $0$ and $1$ down to scales $\mathsf{D}\ll T$
in a neighborhood of size $\mathsf{Q}\gg T$ of some location $x$ (i.e., $x$ is
in the ""bulk""), and the initial configuration is balanced in a certain sense,
then the space-time local statistics at $x$ are asymptotically governed by the
extended discrete sine process (which can be identified with a translation
invariant ergodic Gibbs measure on lozenge tilings of the plane). We also
establish similar results for certain types of random initial data. Our proofs
are based on a detailed analysis of the determinantal correlation kernel for
the noncolliding Bernoulli random walk.
  The noncolliding Bernoulli random walk is a discrete analogue of the
$\beta=2$ Dyson Brownian Motion whose local statistics are universality
governed by the continuous sine process. Our results parallel the ones in the
continuous case. In addition, we naturally include situations with
inhomogeneous local particle density on scale $T$, which nontrivially affects
parameters of the limiting extended sine process, and in a particular case
leads to a new behavior.

simulations, by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation. Cluster
particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by
local gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is
terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium.
We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by
comparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star
clusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a
Schechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with
observations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\alpha\approx 1.8-2$,
while the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related
trend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation
rate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate
that the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star
formation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also
find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr
and decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local
variations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the
scatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when
the instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation
timescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an
additional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback
schemes.

improve the performance of adaptive algorithms and address well-known
trade-offs, such as convergence rate vs. steady-state error. Nevertheless,
typical combinations suffer from a convergence stagnation issue due to the fact
that the component filters run independently. Solutions to this issue usually
involve conditional transfers of coefficients between filters, which although
effective, are hard to generalize to combinations with more filters or when
there is no clearly faster adaptive filter. In this work, a more natural
solution is proposed by cyclically feeding back the combined coefficient vector
to all component filters. Besides coping with convergence stagnation, this new
topology improves tracking and supervisor stability, and bridges an important
conceptual gap between combinations of adaptive filters and variable step size
schemes. We analyze the steady-state, tracking, and transient performance of
this topology for LMS component filters and supervisors with generic activation
functions. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how coefficients feedback
can improve the performance of parallel combinations at a small computational
overhead.

a (strongly correlated) disordered pinning model. The potential takes value 1
at the renewal times of a quenched realization of a renewal process $\sigma$,
and $0$ elsewhere, so nonzero potential values become sparse if the gaps in
$\sigma$ have infinite mean. The ""polymer"" -- of length $\sigma_N$ -- is given
by another renewal $\tau$, whose law is modified by the Boltzmann weight
$\exp(\beta\sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{1}_{\{\sigma_n\in\tau\}})$. Our assumption is
that $\tau$ and $\sigma$ have gap distributions with power-law-decay exponents
$1+\alpha$ and $1+\tilde \alpha$ respectively, with $\alpha\geq 0,\tilde
\alpha>0$. There is a localization phase transition: above a critical value
$\beta_c$ the free energy is positive, meaning that $\tau$ is \emph{pinned} on
the quenched renewal $\sigma$. We consider the question of relevance of the
disorder, that is to know when $\beta_c$ differs from its annealed counterpart
$\beta_c^{\rm ann}$. We show that $\beta_c=\beta_c^{\rm ann}$ whenever $
\alpha+\tilde \alpha \geq 1$, and $\beta_c=0$ if and only if the renewal
$\tau\cap\sigma$ is recurrent. On the other hand, we show $\beta_c>\beta_c^{\rm
ann}$ when $ \alpha+\frac32\, \tilde \alpha <1$. We give evidence that this
should in fact be true whenever $ \alpha+\tilde \alpha<1$, providing examples
for all such $ \alpha,\tilde \alpha$ of distributions of $\tau,\sigma$ for
which $\beta_c>\beta_c^{\rm ann}$. We additionally consider two natural
variants of the model: one in which the polymer and disorder are constrained to
have equal numbers of renewals ($\sigma_N=\tau_N$), and one in which the
polymer length is $\tau_N$ rather than $\sigma_N$. In both cases we show the
critical point is the same as in the original model, at least when $ \alpha>0$.

the desired error or natural condition number associated with the problem (i.e.

allow us to study supernova nucleosynthesis based on first-principle models.
Results of nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that supernovae of the lowest
masses could be important contributors of some lighter n-rich elements beyond
iron. The explosion mechanism of more massive stars is still under
investigation, although first 3D models of neutrino-driven explosions employing
multi-group neutrino transport have recently become available. Together with
earlier 2D models and more simplified 3D simulations, these have elucidated the
interplay between neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in the
post-shock region that is essential for shock revival. However, some physical
ingredients may still need to be added or improved before simulations can
robustly explain supernova explosions over a wide mass range. We explore
possible issues that may affect the accuracy of supernova simulations, and
review some of the ideas that have recently been explored as avenues to robust
explosions, including uncertainties in the neutrino rates, rapid rotation, and
an external forcing of non-radial fluid motions by strong seed perturbations
from convective shell burning. The perturbation-aided neutrino-driven mechanism
and the implications of recent 3D simulations of shell burning in supernova
progenitors are discussed in detail. The efficacy of the perturbation-aided
mechanism is illustrated by the first successful multi-group neutrino
hydrodynamics simulation of an 18 solar mass progenitor with 3D initial
conditions. We conclude with speculations about the potential impact of 3D
effects on the structure of massive stars through convective boundary mixing.

areas-the climate dynamics of atmospheres with a non-dilute condensible
component, defined as the situation in which a condensible component of the
atmosphere makes up a substantial fraction of the atmospheric mass within some
layer. Non-dilute dynamics can occur for a wide range of condensibles,
generically applying near both the inner and the outer edges of the
conventional habitable zone and in connection with runaway greenhouse
phenomena. It also applies in a wide variety of other planetary circumstances.
We first present a number of analytical results developing some key features of
non-dilute atmospheres, and then show how some of these features are manifest
in simulations with a general circulation model adapted to handle non-dilute
atmospheres. We find that non-dilute atmospheres have weak horizontal
temperature gradients even for rapidly rotating planets, and that their
circulations are largely barotropic. The relative humidity of the condensible
component tends towards 100% as the atmosphere becomes more non-dilute, which
has important implications for runaway greenhouse thresholds. Non-dilute
atmospheres exhibit a number of interesting organized convection features, for
which there is not yet any adequate theoretical understanding.

to a slowly flowing melt phase, we observe that for sufficiently high activity,
collective flow accompanied by signatures of local polar and nematic order
appears in the system. This state is also characterised by strong density
fluctuations. Furthermore, we identify an activity-driven cross-over from this
state of coherently flowing bundles of filaments to a phase with no global
flow, formed by individual filaments coiled into rotating spirals. This
suggests a mechanism where the system responds to activity by changing the
shape of active agents, an effect with no analogue in systems of active
particles without internal degrees of freedom.

networking paradigm, which segregates packet forwarding and accounting

flexibility of a networking infrastructure and reduces its operational
expenses. OpenFlow controllers expose standard interfaces to facilitate variety
of networking applications. In particular, a monitoring application can use
these interfaces to push into the OpenFlow switches rules that collect traffic

monitoring of active flows at any required aggregation level. Floware balances
the monitoring overhead among many switches in order to reduce its negative

Suppose its
dual abelian variety $A'$ has good non-ordinary reduction at the primes above
$p$. Let $F_{\infty}/F$ be a $\mathbb Z_p$-extension, and for simplicity,
assume that there is only one prime $\mathfrak p$ of $F_{\infty}$ above $p$,
and $F_{\infty, \mathfrak p}/\mathbb Q_p$ is totally ramified and abelian. (For
example, we can take $F=\mathbb Q(\zeta_{p^N})$ for some $N$, and
$F_{\infty}=\mathbb Q(\zeta_{p^{\infty}})$.) As Perrin-Riou did, we use
Fontaine's theory of group schemes to construct series of points over each
$F_{n, \mathfrak p}$ which satisfy norm relations associated to the Dieudonne
module of $A'$ (in the case of elliptic curves, simply the Euler factor at
$\mathfrak p$), and use these points to construct characteristic power series
$\bf L_{\alpha} \in \mathbb Q_p[[X]]$ analogous to Mazur's characteristic
polynomials in the case of good ordinary reduction. By studying $\bf
L_{\alpha}$, we obtain a weak bound for $\text{rank} E(F_n)$.
  In the second part, we establish a more robust Iwasawa Theory for elliptic
curves, and find a better bound for their ranks under the following conditions:
Take an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $F$. The conditions for $F$ and
$F_{\infty}$ are the same as above. Also as above, we assume $E$ has
supersingular reduction at $\mathfrak p$. We discover that we can construct
series of local points which satisfy finer norm relations under some conditions
related to the logarithm of $E/F_{\mathfrak p}$. Then, we apply Sprung's and
Perrin-Riou's insights to construct \textit{integral} characteristic
polynomials $\bf L_{alg}^{\sharp}$ and $\bf L_{alg}^{\flat}$. One of the
consequences of this construction is that if $\bf L_{alg}^{\sharp}$ and $\bf
L_{alg}^{\flat}$ are not divisible by a certain power of $p$, then
$E(F_{\infty})$ has a finite rank modulo torsions.

scale interactions is difficult due to the cost of keeping large quantities of

this paper, we focus on keeping partial knowledge on causality and address
deduction from that knowledge.

prove that the partial knowledge gives rise to a weaker model than classical

Namely, no matter the order of addition/removal, two devices deduce similarly

they start bisimilar and erase the same causal information. Thanks to our
establishment of forward and backward bisimilarity, respectively, proofs of the

An emission line at the energy of E=6.4 keV consistent with the Fe K\alpha is
also observed. Our best-fit model requires at least three different components:
(i) a hot emission component likely associated with the hot interstellar medium

but static structural signatures have proven more elusive. The observation that
compressing hard-particle packings towards jamming causes growing
hyperuniformity has paved the way for the analysis of jamming as an ""inverted
critical point"" in which the direct correlation function $c(r)$ diverges. We
establish quantitative relationships between various singularities in $c(r)$
and the total correlation function $h(r)$ that provide a concrete means of
identifying features that must be expressed in $c(r)$ if one hopes to reproduce
details in the pair correlation function accurately. We also analyze systems of
three-dimensional monodisperse hard-spheres of diameter $D$ as they approach
ordered and disordered jammed configurations. For the latter, we use the
Lubachevsky-Stillinger (LS) and Torquato-Jiao (TJ) packing algorithms, which
both generate disordered packings, but can show perceptible structural
differences. We identify a short-ranged scaling $c(r) \propto -1/r$ as $r
\rightarrow 0$ and show that this, along with the developing delta function at
$c(D)$, is a consequence of the growing long-rangedness in $c(r)$. Near the
freezing density, we identify qualitative differences in the structure factor
$S(k)$ as well as $c(r)$ between TJ- and LS-generated configurations and link
them to differences in the protocols' packing dynamics. Configurations from
both algorithms have structure factors that approach zero in the low-wavenumber
limit as jamming is approached and are shown to exhibit a corresponding
power-law decay in $c(r)$ for large $r$ as a consequence. Our work advances the
notion that static signatures are exhibited by hard-particle packings as they

coupled oscillators, which are now interpreted from the point of view of
codimension-two bifurcations. On the Ott-Antonsen's manifold, complete
bifurcation sets of delay-coupled Kuramoto model are derived regarding coupling
strength and delay as bifurcation parameters. It is rigorously proved that the
system must undergo Bautin bifurcations for some critical values, thus there
always exists saddle-node bifurcation of periodic solutions inducing hysteresis
loop. With the aid of center manifold reduction method and the Matlab Package
DDE-Biftool, the location of Bautin and double Hopf points and detailed
dynamics are theoretically determined. We find that, near these critical
points, at most four coherent states (two of which are stable) and a stable
incoherent state may coexist, and that the system undergoes Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation of periodic solutions. Finally, the clear scenarios about the
synchronous transition in delayed Kuramoto model are depicted.

the integer-forcing architecture consists of first decoding integer-linear

original messages. For the MIMO BC, the integer-forcing architecture consists
of pre-inverting the integer-linear combinations at the transmitter so that
each receiver can obtain its desired codeword by decoding an integer-linear
combination. In both cases, integer-forcing offers higher achievable rates than
zero-forcing while maintaining a similar implementation complexity. This paper
establishes an uplink-downlink duality relationship for integer-forcing, i.e.,
any sum rate that is achievable via integer-forcing on the MIMO MAC can be
achieved via integer-forcing on the MIMO BC with the same sum power and vice
versa. Using this duality relationship, it is shown that integer-forcing can
operate within a constant gap of the MIMO BC sum capacity. Finally, the paper
proposes a duality-based iterative algorithm for the non-convex problem of
selecting optimal beamforming and equalization vectors, and establishes that it

In many
scenarios of practical interest, financial option prices associated to an
underlying asset reduces to computing an expectation w.r.t.~a diffusion
process. In general, these expectations cannot be calculated analytically, and
one way to approximate these quantities is via the Monte Carlo method; Monte
Carlo methods have been used to price options since at least the 1970's. It has
been seen in Del Moral, P. \& Shevchenko, P.V. (2014) `Valuation of barrier
options using Sequential Monte Carlo' and Jasra, A. \& Del Moral, P. (2011)
`Sequential Monte Carlo for option pricing' that Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods are a natural tool to apply in this context and can vastly improve over
standard Monte Carlo. In this article, in a similar spirit to Del Moral, P. \&
Shevchenko, P.V. (2014) `Valuation of barrier options using sequential Monte
Carlo' and Jasra, A. \& Del Moral, P. (2011) `Sequential Monte Carlo for option
pricing' we show that one can achieve significant gains by using SMC methods by
constructing a sequence of artificial target densities over time. In
particular, we approximate the optimal importance sampling distribution in the
SMC algorithm by using a sequence of weighting functions. This is demonstrated
on two examples, barrier options and target accrual redemption notes (TARN's).
We also provide a proof of unbiasedness of our SMC estimate.

decrease the dehydration barrier of surface Mg2+ by about 0.7-1.1 kcal/mol. In

seemingly unrelated perspectives. On the one hand, they are precisely the
digraphs that admit certain polymorphisms of interest in the study of
constraint satisfaction problems; on the other hand, they are a very broad
generalization of interval graphs.
  Bi-arc digraphs is the class of digraphs that admit conservative semilattice
polymorphisms. There is much interest in understanding structures that admit
particular types of polymorphisms, and especially in their recognition
algorithms. (Such problems are referred to as metaproblems.) Surprisingly, the
class of bi-arc digraphs also describes the class of digraphs that admit
certain other kinds of conservative polymorphisms. Thus solving the recognition
problem for bi-arc digraphs solves the metaproblem for digraphs for several
types of conservative polymorphisms. The complexity of the recognition problem
for digraphs with conservative semilattice polymorphisms was an open problem,
while it was known to be NP-complete for certain more complex relational
structures. We complement our result by providing a complete dichotomy
classification of which general relational structures have polynomial or
NP-complete recognition problems for the existence of conservative semilattice
polymorphisms.
  Bi-arc digraphs also generalizes the class of interval graphs; in fact it
reduces to the class of interval graphs for symmetric and reflexive digraphs.
It is much broader than interval graphs and includes other generalizations of
interval graphs such as co-threshold tolerance graphs and adjusted interval
digraphs. Yet, it is still a reasonable extension of interval graphs, in the
sense that it keeps much of the appeal of interval graphs.
  Our main result is a forbidden obstruction characterization of, and a
polynomial recognition for, the class of bi-arc digraphs.

define interpersonal influence between each pair of users as a parameter, which
is independent from each others, even if the influences come from or affect the

temporal cascades, while sentiments are not associated with them. Thus we
propose to model the interpersonal influence by latent influence and
susceptibility matrices defined on individual users and sentiment polarities.
Such low-dimensional and distributed representations naturally make the
interpersonal influences related to the same user coupled with each other, and
in turn, reduce the model complexity. Sentiments act on different rows of
parameter matrices, depicting their effects in modeling cascades. With the
iterative optimization algorithm of projected stochastic gradient descent over
shuffled mini-batches and Adadelta update rule, negative cases are repeatedly
sampled with the distribution of infection frequencies users, for reducing
computation cost and optimization imbalance. Experiments are conducted on

non-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour. The latter is believed to be associated
with mechanisms that include multiple reaction pathways due to enzymatic
conformational fluctuations. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence
spectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms
underlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a
bottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically
relevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from
single-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented
here, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down
of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For
fewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of
enzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase
in the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic
conformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due
to the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results
confirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the
parallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism
with the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,
convergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate
concentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic
behaviour.

enable extremely high data rate wireless communications. The main limiting
factors of mmWave systems are blockage (high penetration loss) and deafness
(misalignment between the beams of the transmitter and receiver). To alleviate
these problems, it is imperative to incorporate efficient association and
relaying between terminals and access points. Unfortunately, the existing
association techniques are designed for the traditional interference-limited
networks, and thus are highly suboptimal for mmWave communications due to
narrow-beam operations and the resulting non-negligible interference-free
behavior. This paper introduces a distributed approach that solves the joint
association and relaying problem in mmWave networks considering the load
balancing at access points. The problem is posed as a novel stochastic
optimization problem, which is solved by distributed auction algorithms where
the clients and relays act asynchronously to achieve optimal
client-relay-access point association. It is shown that the algorithms provably
converge to a solution that maximizes the aggregate logarithmic utility within
a desired bound. Numerical results allow to quantify the performance
enhancements introduced by the relays, and the substantial improvements of the
network throughput and fairness among the clients by the proposed association
method as compared to standard approaches. It is concluded that mmWave
communications with proper association and relaying mechanisms can support
extremely high data rates, connection reliability, and fairness among the
clients.

widely used for piecewise constant signal estimation with respect to a given
undirected graph. The fused lasso estimate is highly nontrivial to compute when
the underlying graph is large and has an arbitrary structure. But for a special
graph structure, namely, the chain graph, the fused lasso---or simply, 1d fused
lasso---can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we establish a
surprising connection between the total variation of a generic signal defined
over an arbitrary graph, and the total variation of this signal over a chain
graph induced by running depth-first search (DFS) over the nodes of the graph.
Specifically, we prove that for any signal, its total variation over the
induced chain graph is no more than twice its total variation over the original
graph. This connection leads to several interesting theoretical and
computational conclusions. Denoting by $m$ and $n$ the number of edges and
nodes, respectively, of the graph in question, our result implies that for an
underlying signal with total variation $t$ over the graph, the fused lasso
achieves a mean squared error rate of \smash{$t^{2/3} n^{-2/3}$}. Moreover,
precisely the same mean squared error rate is achieved by running the 1d fused
lasso on the induced chain graph from running DFS. Importantly, the latter
estimator is simple and computationally cheap, requiring only $O(m)$ operations
for constructing the DFS-induced chain and $O(n)$ operations for computing the
1d fused lasso solution over this chain. Further, for trees that have bounded
max degree, the error rate of \smash{$t^{2/3} n^{-2/3}$} cannot be improved, in
the sense that it is the minimax rate for signals that have total variation $t$
over the tree.

of 0.1 eV, 1 keV, 100 GeV and 30 TeV as representative of gauge mediated,
gravity mediated and anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We find
that the abundance of gravitinos produced in the early Universe is very high
for gravitinos of mass 1 keV and 100 GeV. The gravitino abundances can be
sufficiently suppressed if the reheat temperature is less than 100 GeV and
$4\cdot 10^4$ gev respectively. However such low reheat temperatures will rule
out many models of baryogenesis including those via leptogenesis.

Initially, every particle was in A (this means a black hole), and as time goes
on, particles move to either B (means Hawking radiation) or C (means a broadly
defined remnant, including a non-local transport of information, the last

information will be stored by both of the radiation and the mutual information
between the radiation and the remnant, while the remnant itself does not
contain information. On the other hand, if the final number of states of the

negligible information, while the remnant and the mutual information between

eliminate the synchronization then lead the Kuramoto model to incoherence. On

it is also difficult to accurately answer questions like 'where are the

wide-coverage street view images. From the various factors that are at work, we
choose two key features, the visual quality of street facade and the continuity

test the validity of this method, we further compare the machine ratings with
ratings collected on site from 752 passers-by on fifty-six locations. We show
that the machine learning model can produce a good estimation of people's real

mobile social networks, where they share location-based information with each
other when traveling on different routes and visit different areas of the city.
In our model the information collected is aggregated over all users' trips and
made publicly available as a public good. Due to information overlap, the total
useful content amount increases with the diversity in path choices made by the
users, and it is crucial to motivate selfish users to choose different paths
despite the potentially higher costs associated with their trips. In this paper
we combine the benefits from social information sharing with the fundamental
routing problem where a unit mass of non-atomic selfish users decide their
trips in a non-cooperative game by choosing between a high-cost and a low-cost
path. To remedy the inefficient low-content equilibrium where all users choose
to explore a single path (the low-cost path), we propose and analyse two new
incentive mechanisms that can be used by the social network application, one
based on side payments and the other on restricting access to content for users
that choose the low cost path. We also obtain interesting price of anarchy
results that show some fundamental tradeoffs between achieving path diversity
and maintaining greater user participation, motivating a combined mechanism to
further increase the social welfare. Our model extends classical dynamic
routing in the case of externalities caused from traffic on different paths of
the network.

et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015] presented a bit commitment scheme where each
party uses two agents that exchange classical information in a synchronized
fashion, and that is both hiding and binding. A caveat is that the commitment
time is intrinsically limited by the spatial configuration of the players, and
increasing this time requires the agents to exchange messages during the whole
duration of the protocol. While such a solution remains computationally
attractive, its practicality is severely limited in realistic settings since
all communication must remain perfectly synchronized at all times.
  In this work, we introduce a robust protocol for relativistic bit commitment
that tolerates failures of the classical communication network. This is done by
adding a third agent to both parties. Our scheme provides a quadratic
improvement in terms of expected sustain time compared to the original
protocol, while retaining the same level of security.

exponents. It is found that the conventional finite size scaling is valid here.
In two dimensions however, the persistence probabilities are no longer

spins shows the behaviour $P_{min}(t) \sim t^{-\gamma}\exp(-(t/\tau)^{\delta})$

(Mstar = 8 10^{10}Msun) develop global outflows sustained by SNIa's heating,
ending with a significantly lower amount of hot gas and new stars. In more
massive models, nuclear outbursts last to the present epoch, with large and
frequent fluctuations in nuclear emission and from the gas (Lx). Each burst
last ~ 10^{7.5} yr, during which (for r < 2-3 kpc) cold, inflowing, and hot,
outflowing gas phases coexist. The Lx-T relation for the gas matches that of
local galaxies. AGN activity causes positive feedback for star formation.
Roughly half of the total mass loss is recycled into new stars (DeltaMstar),
just ~ 3% of it is accreted on the MBH, the remainder being ejected from the
galaxy. The ratio between the mass of gas expelled to that in to new stars, the
load factor, is ~0.6. Rounder galaxies shapes lead to larger final MBH masses,
DeltaMstar, and Lx. Almost all the time is spent at very low nuclear
luminosities, yet one quarter of the total energy is emitted at an Eddington
ratio > 0.1. The duty-cycle of AGN activity approximates 4% (Abridged).

Hall effect at room temperature, provoking us to explore their electronic
structures for topological properties. By ab initio band structure
calculations, we have observed the existence of multiple Weyl points in the
bulk and corresponding Fermi arcs on the surface, predicting antiferromagnetic
Weyl semimetals in Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn. Here the chiral antiferromagnetism in the
Kagome-type lattice structure is essential to determine the positions and
numbers of Weyl points. Our work further reveals a new guiding principle to
search for magnetic Weyl semimetals among materials that exhibit a strong
anomalous Hall effect.

average pressure is required in order to describe a macroscopic state of the

the ideal gas in the absence of gravity. Applying our results to a small volume
in a Newtonian star, however, we find that the conventional one is reliable for

evolutionary stages that are still not well constrained. The goal of this paper
is to investigate the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to
put constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in particular
in both the thin and thick discs. Thanks to high-resolution spectra from the
ESO archive and high quality atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a
massive and homogeneous catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived
with an automatic method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton
algorithm. We validated these lithium abundances with literature values,
including those of the Gaia benchmark stars. In terms of lithium galactic
evolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance increases with
metallicity by 1 dex from [M/H]=-1 dex to +0.0 dex. Moreover, we find that this
lithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5 dex at super-solar metalllicity.
Based on a chemical separation, we also observed that the stellar lithium
content in the thick disc increases rather slightly with metallicity, while the
thin disc shows a steeper increase. The lithium abundance distribution of
alpha-rich, metal-rich stars has a peak at A(Li)~3 dex. We conclude that the
thick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical enrichment, showing lithium
abundances rather close to the Spite plateau while the thin disc stars clearly
show an increasing lithium chemical enrichment with the metallicity, probably
thanks to the contribution of low-mass stars.

exactly solved spin-1/2 Fisher's super-exchange antiferromagnet are rigorously
calculated in order to examine magnetocaloric properties of the model in a
vicinity of the second-order phase transition. It is shown that the large
inverse magnetocaloric effect occurs around the temperature interval
$T_c(h\neq0) < T < T_c(h=0)$ for any magnetic-field change $\Delta h: 0 \to h$.
The most pronounced inverse magnetocaloric effect can be found for the
magnetic-field change, which coincides with the critical field of a
zero-temperature phase transition from the antiferromagnetically ordered ground
state to the paramagnetic one.

self-gravitational effect on the torus structure. By charging mechanisms it
also acquires non-zero electric charge density, so the two influences need to

station (BS) is responsible for establishing D2D links. We consider that an
arbitrary requesting user is offloaded to D2D mode to communicate with one of
its 'k' closest D2D helpers within the macrocell subject to content
availability and helper selection scheme. We consider two different D2D helper
selection schemes: 1) uniform selection (US), where the D2D helper is selected
uniformly and 2) nearest selection (NS), where the nearest helper possessing
the content is selected. Employing tools from stochastic geometry, we model the
locations of BSs and D2D helpers using independent homogeneous Poisson point
processes (HPPPs). We characterize the D2D mode probability of an arbitrary
user for both the NS and US schemes. The distribution of the distance between
an arbitrary user and its ith neighboring D2D helper within the macrocell is
derived using disk approximation for the Voronoi cell, which is shown to be
reasonably accurate. We fully characterize the overall coverage probability and
the average ergodic rate of an arbitrary user requesting a particular content.
We show that significant performance gains can be achieved compared to
conventional cellular communication under both the NS and US schemes when
popular contents are requested and NS scheme always outperforms the US scheme.
Our analysis reveals an interesting trade off between the performance metrics
and the number of candidate D2D helpers 'k'. We conclude that enhancing D2D
opportunities for the users does not always result in better performance and
the network parameters have to be carefully tuned to harness maximum gains.

There have been numerous methods proposed for human identification (e.g., face
recognition, gait recognition, fingerprint identification, etc.). While these
methods could be very useful under different conditions, they also suffer from
certain shortcomings (e.g., user privacy, sensing coverage range). In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for human identification, which leverages
WIFI signals to enable non-intrusive human identification in domestic
environments. It is based on the observation that each person has specific
influence patterns to the surrounding WIFI signal while moving indoors,
regarding their body shape characteristics and motion patterns. The influence
can be captured by the Channel State Information (CSI) time series of WIFI.
Specifically, a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques is used for
CSI waveform-based human identification. We implemented the system in a 6m*5m
smart home environment and recruited 9 users for data collection and
evaluation. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy is
about 88.9% to 94.5% when the candidate user set changes from 6 to 2, showing
that the proposed human identification method is effective in domestic
environments.

exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers by transmitting ultrasonic signals
via the computer's speakers. However, such acoustic communication relies on the
availability of speakers on a computer. In this paper, we present
'DiskFiltration,' a covert channel which facilitates the leakage of data from
an air-gapped compute via acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive
(HDD). Our method is unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it
doesn't require the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the air-gapped
computer. A malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic
emissions at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the
HDD's actuator arm. Digital Information can be modulated over the acoustic
signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone,
smartwatch, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its
acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and detection,

we developed a transmitter on a personal computer and a receiver on a

evaluate our covert channel on various types of internal and external HDDs in

importance in tokamak plasmas is due to their role in the regulation of
turbulence. The linear collisionless damping of GAMs is investigated here by
means of analytical theory and numerical simulations with the global
gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code ORB5. The combined effect of the phase mixing
and Landau damping is found to quickly redistribute the GAM energy in
phase-space, due to the synergy of the finite orbit width of the passing ions
and the cascade in wave number given by the phase mixing. When plasma
parameters characteristic of realistic tokamak profiles are considered, the GAM
decay time is found to be an order of magnitude lower than the decay due to the
Landau damping alone, and in some cases of the same order of magnitude of the
characteristic GAM drive time due to the nonlinear interaction with an ITG
mode. In particular, the radial mode structure evolution in time is
investigated here and reproduced quantitatively by means of a dedicated initial

we discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we
have now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the
framework of our previous work. Methods. We apply a standard 1D LTE analysis to
the spectrum of this star. We measure the abundances of 14 chemical elements;
for Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn we compute the abundances
using equivalent widths; for C, Sr and Ba we obtain the abundances by means of
synthetic spectra generated by MOOG. Results. We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=
$-$3.5 $\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an
iron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained
by a low resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not
carbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover, this star
lies in the plane [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] in a relatively unusual position, shared
by a few others galactic halo stars that is only marginally explained by our
past results. Conclusions. The comparison of the model results with the
chemical abundance characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we
consider in our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating
massive stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and
faint supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both
required in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases of the
chemical enrichment of the Universe.

fermions through a process involving particle detection, focusing on the
implications that this kind of processes have for the concept of entanglement
between fermionic particles. As a paradigmatic example we discuss in detail a
scheme based on a splitting-plus-detection operation. This scheme generates
states with accessible entanglement starting from an initial pure state of two
indistinguishable fermions exhibiting correlations due purely to
antisymmetrization. It is argued that the proposed extraction of entanglement
does not contravene the notion that entanglement in identical-fermion systems
requires correlations beyond those purely due to their indistinguishability. In
point of fact, it is shown that this concept of entanglement, here referred to
as {\it fermonic entanglement}, actually helps to clarify some essential
aspects of the entanglement generation process. In particular, we prove that
the amount of extracted accessible entanglement equals the amount of fermionic
entanglement created with the detection process. The aforementioned scheme is
generalized for the case of $N$-identical fermion systems of arbitrary
dimension. It transpires from our present discussion that a proper analysis of
entanglement generation during the splitting-plus-detection operation is not
only consistent with the concept of fermonic entanglement, but actually
reinforces this concept.

$\chi$ does not receive any vacuum expectation value ($vev$) in the model

displaying altruistic behaviours will be driven to extinction by mutant cheats
that absorb common benefits but do not themselves contribute. Here we show that
when demographic stochasticity is accounted for, selection can in fact act in
the reverse direction to that predicted deterministically, instead favouring
cooperative behaviors that appreciably increase the carrying capacity of the
population. Populations that exist in larger numbers experience a selective
advantage by being more stochastically robust to invasions than smaller
populations, and this advantage can persist even in the presence of
reproductive costs. We investigate this general effect in the specific context
of public goods production and find conditions for stochastic selection
reversal leading to the success of public good producers. This insight,
developed here analytically, is missed by both the deterministic analysis as
well as standard game theoretic models that enforce a fixed population size.
The effect is found to be amplified by space; in this scenario we find that
selection reversal occurs within biologically reasonable parameter regimes for
microbial populations. Beyond the public good problem, we formulate a general
mathematical framework for models that may exhibit stochastic selection
reversal. In this context, we describe a stochastic analogue to r-K theory, by

formation, packet forwarding, resource and power optimization, coverage
optimization, efficient task allocation, and security. For these issues,
sensors have to make optimal decisions from current capabilities and available
strategies to achieve desirable goals. This paper reviews numerous applications
of the economic and pricing models, known as intelligent rational
decision-making methods, to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for WSNs.
Besides, we survey a variety of pricing strategies in providing incentives for
phone users in crowdsensing applications to contribute their sensing data.
Furthermore, we consider the use of some pricing models in Machine-to-Machine

GLB-5 signaling broadens the O2 preference of C. elegans while maintaining
strong avoidance of 21% O2. Our computational aerotaxis model suggests that the

sufficient to broaden O2-preference. Thus, a neuroglobin can shift neural

index $2$ overgroup that is not conjugacy separable. Conversely, we construct a
finitely presented group $G_2$ which has a non-conjugacy separable subgroup of

such a group $G_2$ will always posses an index $3$ overgroup that is not

  Finally, we characterize $p$-conjugacy separable subdirect products of two
free groups, where $p$ is a prime. We show that fibre products provide a
natural correspondence between residually finite $p$-groups and $p$-conjugacy
separable subdirect products of two non-abelian free groups. As a consequence,
we deduce that the open question about the existence of an infinite finitely

dependence on the strength of the barrier region. The tunability of the thermal
conductance by an external electric field is also investigated. Moreover, we
explore the effect of doping concentration on thermal conductance. In the thin
barrier limit, the period of oscillations of the thermal conductance as a
function of the barrier strength comes out be $\pi/2$ when doping concentration
in the normal silicene region is small. On the other hand, the period gradually
converts to $\pi$ with the enhancement of the doping concentration. Such change
of periodicity of the thermal response with doping can be a possible probe to
identify the crossover from specular to retro Andreev reflection in Dirac
materials. In the thick barrier limit, thermal conductance exhibits oscillatory
behavior as a function of barrier thickness $d$ and barrier height $V_0$ while
the period of oscillation becomes $V_0$ dependent. However, amplitude of the

increase of barrier thickness for arbitrary height $V_0$ in the highly doped

approach can be used to derive constraints for tidal migration, capture in

a secular resonance between the precession of the orbit and the precession of
the spin of one of the stars. We also show that circumbinary systems for which

render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a.
the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection
reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization
with improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the
constraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with
only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one
projection yields $O(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which improves over the
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth
optimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we
introduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for
non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of
projections. In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of $\widetilde
O(1/\epsilon^{2(1-\theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $\widetilde

as the time-energy uncertainty relation and the tunneling delay time, have
recently been addressed in attosecond optical ioniza- tion experiments. The
parameter status of time in the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) is
supported by the well-known Pauli's ob- jection as well as by its
interpretation as an emerging property of entangle- ment with a classical
environment. On the other hand, the introduction of a self-adjoint dynamical
time operator in Dirac's formulation of elec- tron's relativistic quantum
mechanics (RQM), yields an additional system observable that represents an
internal time. In the present paper the re- lation of this internal time with
the parametric (laboratory) time and its relevance to the tunneling
measurements in these experiments is examined within the standard framework of
RQM.

relation for early-type galaxies (ETGs) can be traced back to the existence of
a fine-tuning between the average star formation rate $<SFR>$ of galaxies and
their structural and dynamical characteristics. To get such result it is
necessary to imagine the existence of two distinct ""virtual planes"" for each
galaxy in the $\log(R_e)-\log(I_e)-\log(\sigma)$ space. The first one (named
Virial Plane VP) represents the total galaxy mass using the scalar Virial
Theorem and the mass-to-light ratio $M/L$, while the second plane comes from an
expression of the total galaxy luminosity as a function of the mean star
formation rate $<SFR>$ and the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, through a relation
$L=L'_0 \sigma^{-2}$ (named here pseudo-Faber-Jackson (PFJ)) which is a
mathematical convenient way for expressing the independency of light from the
virial equilibrium. Its validity can be connected to the mutual correlation
$L\sim\sigma\sqrt{<SFR>}$ observed for all ETGs.
  A posteriori it is possible to see that this approach permits to explain the
observed properties of the FP (tilt and scatter) and the Zone of Exclusions
(ZOE) visible in the FP projections. Furthermore, the link between the
properties of the FP and the SFR of galaxies provides a new idea of the star
formation, as a phenomenon driven by the initial conditions of proto-galaxies
and regulated across the whole cosmic history by the variation of the main
galaxy parameters (mass, luminosity, structural shape and velocity dispersion).

reinterpretation of previous observations have revealed the existence of ring
systems around 10199 Chariklo and 2060 Chiron. However, the origin of the ring
systems around such a minor planet is still an open question. Here, we propose
that the tidal disruption of a differentiated object that experiences a close
encounter with a giant planet could naturally form diverse ring-satellite
systems around the Centaurs. During the close encounter, the icy mantle of the
passing object is preferentially ripped off by the planet's tidal force and the
debris is distributed mostly within the Roche limit of the largest remnant
body. Assuming the existence of $20-50$wt% silicate core below the icy mantle,
a disk of particles is formed when the objects pass within $0.4-0.8$ of the
planet's Roche limit with the relative velocity at infinity $3-6$km s$^{-1}$
and 8h initial spin period of the body. The resultant ring mass is $0.1-10$% of
the central object's mass. Such particle disks are expected to spread radially,
and materials spreading beyond the Roche limit would accrete into satellite(s).
Our numerical results suggest that ring formation would be a natural outcome of
such extreme close encounters and Centaurs can naturally have such ring systems
because they cross the orbits of the giant planets.

been directly compared with experimental data produce photon absorption
cross-sections for Fe XVII that are effectively equivalent to (and in fact
larger than) the new R-matrix opacities. Thus, the new R-matrix results cannot
be expected to significantly impact the existing discrepancies between theory
and experiment because they produce neither a ""large enhancement"" nor account
for ""missing continuum plasma opacity"" relative to standard models.

  large-scale evidence for the principle of least effort",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0173614",,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Languages employ different strategies to transmit structural and grammatical
information. While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in
sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like
Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for
languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as those languages (also) use the
internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark grammatical
relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than
1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in more than 1,100
different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6
billion people (more than 80% of the world population), we present large-scale
evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed
by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal
word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information
tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. In addition, we
find that - despite differences in the way information is expressed - there is
also evidence for a trade-off between different books of the biblical canon
that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative the
word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa.
We argue that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode
information in very different (but efficient) ways. On the other hand,
content-related and stylistic features are statistically encoded in very
similar ways.

the inhomogeneity of the inertial field are not oscillatory but they are very

argument proceeds by interpreting System T programs as well-founded dialogue

longtime evolution of the space-time fluctuations. Gravitational waves interact
themselves through the nonlinear character of Einstein's equations of general
relativity. This nonlinear wave interaction allows the spectral energy transfer
from mode to mode. According to the wave turbulence theory, the weakly
nonlinear interaction of gravitational waves leads to the existence of an
irreversible kinetic regime that dominates the longtime evolution. The
resulting kinetic equation suggests the existence of an equilibrium wave
spectrum and the existence of a non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum
for spatio-temporal fluctuations. Evidence of these solutions extracted in the
fluctuating signal of the recent observations will be discussed in the paper.
Probably, the present results would be pertinent in the new age of development
of gravitational astronomy, as well as, in new tests of General Relativity.

important role in several distinct systems, including the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction, seizures in the brain, and lethal arrhythmia in the heart. Because
spiral wave dynamics can exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors, its precise
quantification can be challenging. Here we present a hybrid geometric and
information-theoretic approach to quantifying spiral wave dynamics. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to numerical
simulations of a two-dimensional excitable medium with different numbers and
spatial patterns of spiral waves. We show that, by defining information flow
over the excitable medium, hidden coherent structures emerge that effectively
quantify the information transport underlying spiral wave dynamics. Most
importantly, we find that some coherent structures become more clearly defined
over a longer observation period. These findings validate our approach to
quantitatively characterize spiral wave dynamics by focusing on information
transport. Our approach is computationally efficient and is applicable to many
excitable media of interest in distinct physical, chemical and biological
systems. Our approach could ultimately contribute to an improved therapy of
clinical conditions such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmia by identifying
potential targets of interventional therapies.

active sources, which cancel out selected multipole orders of the scattered

achieve efficient cloaking with the active sources positioned on a circle
