magnetic field ($\vec B$) inducing a vorticity in the reaction plane. The high
$\vec{B}$ influences the evolution dynamics that is opposed by the large
Faraday current due to electric field generated by the time varying $\vec{B}$.
We show that the resultant effects entail a significantly large directed flow
($v_1$) of charm quarks (CQs) compared to light quarks due to a combination of
several favorable conditions for CQs, mainly: (i) unlike light quarks formation
time scale of CQs, $\tau_f \simeq \, 0.1 \rm fm/c$ is comparable to the time
scale when $\vec B$ attains its maximum value and (ii) the kinetic relaxation
time of CQs is similar to the QGP lifetime, this helps the CQ to retain the
initial kick picked up from the electromagnetic field in the transverse
direction. The effect is also odd under charge exchange allowing to distinguish
it from the vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum
conservation; conjointly thanks to its mass, $M_c >>\Lambda_{QCD}$, there
should be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics. Hence CQs provide very
crucial and independent information on the strength of the magnetic field
produced in HIC.

hemispherical asymmetry in power nearly aligned with the Ecliptic. In real
space, this anomaly can be quantified by the temperature variance in the
northern and southern Ecliptic hemispheres. In this context, the northern
hemisphere displays an anomalously low variance while the southern hemisphere
appears unremarkable (consistent with expectations from the best-fitting
theory, $\Lambda$CDM). While this is a well established result in temperature,
the low signal-to-noise ratio in current polarization data prevents a similar
comparison. This will change with a proposed ground-based CMB experiment,
CMB-S4. With that in mind, we generate realizations of polarization maps
constrained by the temperature data and predict the distribution of the
hemispherical variance in polarization considering two different sky coverage
scenarios possible in CMB-S4: full Ecliptic north coverage and just the portion
of the North that can be observed from a ground based telescope at the high
Chilean Atacama plateau. We find that even in the set of realizations
constrained by the temperature data, the low northern hemisphere variance
observed in temperature is not expected in polarization. Therefore, an
anomalously low variance detection in polarization would provide strong
evidence against the hypothesis that the temperature anomaly is simply a
statistical fluke. We show, within $\Lambda$CDM, how variance measurements in
both sky coverage scenarios are related. We find that the variance makes for a
good statistic in cases where the sky coverage is limited, however a full
northern coverage is still preferable.

objects from depth images, under large gripper pose uncertainty. Whilst most
approaches aim to predict the single best grasp pose from an image, our method
first predicts a score for every possible grasp pose, which we denote the grasp
function. With this, it is possible to achieve grasping robust to the gripper's
pose uncertainty, by smoothing the grasp function with the pose uncertainty
function. Therefore, if the single best pose is adjacent to a region of poor
grasp quality, that pose will no longer be chosen, and instead a pose will be
chosen which is surrounded by a region of high grasp quality. To learn this
function, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which takes as input a single
depth image of an object, and outputs a score for each grasp pose across the
image. Training data for this is generated by use of physics simulation and
depth image simulation with 3D object meshes, to enable acquisition of
sufficient data without requiring exhaustive real-world experiments. We
evaluate with both synthetic and real experiments, and show that the learned
grasp score is more robust to gripper pose uncertainty than when this
uncertainty is not accounted for.

great promise for nanoelectronics. Understanding the pattern of current flow
will be crucial for developing devices. In this talk, we present images of
current flow in MoS2 obtained with a Scanned Probe Microscope (SPM) cooled to 4
K. We previously used this technique to image electron trajectories in
GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and graphene. The charged SPM tip is held just
above the sample surface, creating an image charge inside the device that
scatters electrons. By measuring the change in resistance {\Delta}R while the
tip is raster scanned above the sample, an image of electron flow is obtained.
We present images of electron flow in an MoS2 device patterned into a hall bar
geometry. A three-layer MoS2 sheet is encased by two hBN layers, top and
bottom, and patterned into a hall-bar with multilayer graphene contacts. An SPM
image shows the current flow pattern from the wide contact at the end of the
device for a Hall density n = 1.3x10^12 cm^-2. The SPM tip tends to block flow,
increasing the resistance R. The pattern of flow was also imaged for a narrow
side contact on the sample. At density n = 5.4x10^11 cm^-2; the pattern seen in
the SPM image is similar to the wide contact. The ability to image electron
flow promises to be very useful for the development of ultrathin devices from
new 2D materials.

extending the Lambek calculus with the linear logic exponential modality while
keeping Lambek's restriction. Interestingly enough, we show that for any system
equipped with a reasonable exponential modality the following holds: if the

two of the three conditions can be implemented. Namely, we design a system with
Lambek's restriction and cut elimination and another system with Lambek's

undecidable, even if we take only one of the two divisions provided by the

  Processing",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there are increasing interests in inferring mirco-expression from
facial image sequences. Due to subtle facial movement of micro-expressions,
feature extraction has become an important and critical issue for spontaneous
facial micro-expression recognition. Recent works usually used spatiotemporal
local binary pattern for micro-expression analysis. However, the commonly used
spatiotemporal local binary pattern considers dynamic texture information to
represent face images while misses the shape attribute of face images. On the
other hand, their works extracted the spatiotemporal features from the global
face regions, which ignore the discriminative information between two
micro-expression classes. The above-mentioned problems seriously limit the
application of spatiotemporal local binary pattern on micro-expression
recognition. In this paper, we propose a discriminative spatiotemporal local
binary pattern based on an improved integral projection to resolve the problems
of spatiotemporal local binary pattern for micro-expression recognition.
Firstly, we develop an improved integral projection for preserving the shape
attribute of micro-expressions. Furthermore, an improved integral projection is
incorporated with local binary pattern operators across spatial and temporal
domains. Specifically, we extract the novel spatiotemporal features
incorporating shape attributes into spatiotemporal texture features. For
increasing the discrimination of micro-expressions, we propose a new feature
selection based on Laplacian method to extract the discriminative information
for facial micro-expression recognition. Intensive experiments are conducted on
three availably published micro-expression databases. We compare our method
with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method achieves promising performance for micro-expression
recognition.

roadblock hindering further development of quantum technologies: The effort of
quantum tomography---the characterization of processes and states within a
quantum device---scales unfavorably to the point that state-of-the-art systems
can no longer be treated. Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by
reconstructing the state from an incomplete set of observables. In this work,
we present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven
qubit system---the largest-scale realization to date---and we introduce new
numerical methods in order to scale the reconstruction to this dimension.
Originally, compressed sensing has been advocated for density matrices with few
non-zero eigenvalues. Here, we argue that the low-rank estimates provided by
compressed sensing can be appropriate even in the general case. The reason is
that statistical noise often allows only for the leading eigenvectors to be
reliably reconstructed: We find that the remaining eigenvectors behave in a way
consistent with a random matrix model that carries no information about the
true state. We report a reconstruction of quantum states from a topological
color code of seven qubits, prepared in a trapped ion architecture, based on
tomographically incomplete data involving 127 Pauli basis measurement settings

two-loop beta functions for parameters of the scalar potential. We also prove
that consistent application of the proposed regularization leads to
counterterms which, together with the original action, combine to a bare action
expressed in terms of bare parameters. This, together with treating $\Lambda$
as an intrinsic scale of a hypothetical underlying finite theory of all
interactions, offers a possibility of an unconventional solution to the
hierarchy problem if no intermediate scales between the electroweak scale and
the Planck scale exist.

treatment or intervention on a single outcome; in many modern studies, however,
data on multiple outcomes are collected and it is of interest to explore
effects on multiple outcomes simultaneously. Such designs can be particularly
useful in patient-centered research, where different outcomes might be more or
less important to different patients. In this paper we propose scaled effect
measures (via potential outcome notation) that translate effects on multiple
outcomes to a common scale, using mean-variance and median-interquartile-range

methods for estimating these scaled effects (and weighted average summary

outcomes equally. We also discuss methods for exploring how treatment effects
depend on covariates (i.e., effect modification). In addition to describing
efficiency theory for our estimands and the asymptotic behavior of our
estimators, we illustrate the methods in a simulation study and a data

considerations of many factors, e.g., providing heterogeneous service delay
guarantees for batch workloads, interactive workload allocation, batch workload

and the ramping constraints of backup generators. Then, we design a realtime

speed-up, whereas a declining negative MT torque at the lower latitudes causes
the equator to slow-down. These changes in the zonal flows propagate through

particular, the independence polynomial with negative arguments,
$Z(-\mathbf{p})$, determines the Shearer region, the maximal region of
probabilities to which the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) can be extended (Shearer
1985). In statistical physics, complex zeros of the independence polynomial
relate to existence of phase transitions.
  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm to compute approximately the
independence polynomial in any root-free complex polydisc centered at the
origin. Our algorithm is essentially the same as Weitz's algorithm for positive
parameters up to the tree uniqueness threshold, and the core of our analysis is
a novel multivariate form of the correlation decay technique, which can handle
non-uniform complex parameters. In particular, in the univariate real setting
our work implies that Weitz's algorithm works in an interval between two
critical points $(\lambda'_c(d), \lambda_c(d))$, and outside of this interval
an approximation of $Z(\mathbf{z})$ is known to be NP-hard.
  As an application, we give a sub-exponential time algorithm for testing
approximate membership in the Shearer region. We also give a new rounding based
deterministic algorithm for Shearer's lemma (an extension of the LLL), which,
however, runs in sub-exponential time. On the hardness side, we prove that
evaluating $Z(\mathbf{z})$ at an arbitrary point in Shearer's region, and
testing membership in Shearer's region, are #P-hard problems. We also establish
the best possible dependence of the exponent of the run time of Weitz's
correlation decay technique in the negative regime on the distance to the

activity. They are physically linked to the convection efficiency, differential

However, for ages > 2 Gyr, the age-activity relationship remains poorly
constrained thus hampering its full application. The Ca II infrared triplet
(IRT lines) has been poorly studied compared to classical chromospheric
indicators. We report in this paper absolute chromospheric fluxes in the three
Ca II IRT lines, based on a new calibration tied to up-to-date model
atmospheres. We obtain the Ca II IRT absolute fluxes for 113 FGK stars from
high signal-to-noise ratio and high-resolution spectra covering an extensive
domain of chromospheric activity levels. We perform an absolute continuum flux
calibration for the Ca II IRT lines anchored in atmospheric models calculated
as an explicit function of effective temperatures, metallicity, and gravities
avoiding the degeneracy present in photometric continuum calibrations based
solely on color indices. The internal uncertainties achieved for continuum
absolute flux calculations are 2\% of the solar chromospheric flux, one order
of magnitude lower than photometric calibrations. We gauge the impact of
observational errors on the final chromospheric fluxes due to the absolute
continuum flux calibration and find that $T_{\rm eff}$ uncertainties are
properly mitigated by the photospheric correction leaving [Fe/H] as the
dominating factor in the chromospheric flux uncertainty. Across the FGK
spectral types, the Ca II IRT lines are sensitive to chromospheric activity.
The reduced internal uncertainties reported here enable us to build a new
chromospheric absolute flux scale and explore the age-activity relation from
the active regime down to very low activity levels and a wide range of $T_{\rm
eff}$, mass, [Fe/H], and age.

for supplementary metadata. However JPEG compression, being a conventional
method to compress images, leads to exact authentication breaking. We discuss a
semi-fragile watermarking system for digital images tolerant to JPEG/JPEG2000
compression. Recently we have published a selective authentication method based
on Zernike moments. But unfortunately it has large computational complexity and
not sufficiently good detection of small image modifications. In the current
paper it is proposed (in contrast to Zernike moments approach) the usage of
image finite differences and 3-bit quantization as the main technique. In order
to embed a watermark (WM) into the image, some areas of the Haar wavelet
transform coefficients are used. Simulation results show a good resistance of
this method to JPEG compression with $\mbox{\rm CR}\leq 30\%$ (Compression
Ratio), high probability of small image modification recognition, image quality
assessments $\mbox{\rm PSNR}\geq 40$ (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) dB and
$\mbox{\rm SSIM}\geq 0.98$ (Structural Similarity Index Measure) after
embedding and lower computation complexity of WM embedding and extraction. All
these properties qualify this approach as effective.

$>2\times 10^{7}$ sec in the quasar rest frame, $55\%$ of the quasars (21/38)

time interval for significant variability as opposed to a gradual increase on

dimension of the EUV region. We explore this concept in the context of the slim

radial infall time to the plunge region of the optically thin surface layer of

reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries and responding to
emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has gone into developing
vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone delivery scenarios.
Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning drone deliveries: either multiple
trips to the depot are not permitted, leading to solutions with excess drones,
or the effect of battery and payload weight on energy consumption is not
considered, leading to costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multi-trip
VRPs for drone delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject
to a delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time
subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and experimentally
validate an energy consumption model for multirotor drones, demonstrating that
energy consumption varies approximately linearly with payload and battery
weight. We use this approximation to derive mixed integer linear programs for
our VRPs. We propose a cost function that considers our energy consumption
model and drone reuse, and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for
finding sub-optimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery
practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is used
to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential relationship with the
delivery time limit, and the minimum overall delivery time has an inverse
exponential relationship with the budget. Numerical results confirm the
importance of reusing drones and optimizing battery size in drone delivery
VRPs.

galaxies, we mapped the real space distributions of galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We use an ensemble of mock
catalogs to demonstrate the reliability of our method. Here as the first paper
in a series, we mainly focus on the two point correlation function (2PCF) of
galaxies. Overall the 2PCF measured in the reconstructed real space for
galaxies brighter than $^{0.1}{\rm M}_r-5\log h=-19.0$ agrees with the direct
measurement to an accuracy better than the measurement error due to cosmic
variance, if the reconstruction uses the correct cosmology. Applying the method
to the SDSS DR7, we construct a real space version of the main galaxy catalog,
which contains 396,068 galaxies in the North Galactic Cap with redshifts in the
range $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.12$. The Sloan Great Wall, the largest known
structure in the nearby Universe, is not as dominant an over-dense structure as
appears to be in redshift space. We measure the 2PCFs in reconstructed real
space for galaxies of different luminosities and colors. All of them show clear
deviations from single power-law forms, and reveal clear transitions from
1-halo to 2-halo terms. A comparison with the corresponding 2PCFs in redshift
space nicely demonstrates how RSDs boost the clustering power on large scales
(by about $40-50\%$ at scales $\sim 10 h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$) and suppress it on
small scales (by about $70-80\%$ at a scale of $0.3 h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$).

and relational interactions in a wide range of fields. By learning the
structure of independences of a domain, more accurate joint probability
distributions can be obtained for inference tasks or, more directly, for
interpreting the most significant relations among the variables. Recently,
several researchers have investigated techniques for automatically learning the
structure from data by obtaining the probabilistic maximum-a-posteriori
structure given the available data. However, all the approximations proposed
decompose the posterior of the whole structure into local sub-problems, by
assuming that the posteriors of the Markov blankets of all the variables are
mutually independent. In this work, we propose a scoring function for relaxing
such assumption. The Blankets Joint Posterior score computes the joint
posterior of structures as a joint distribution of the collection of its Markov
blankets. Essentially, the whole posterior is obtained by computing the
posterior of the blanket of each variable as a conditional distribution that
takes into account information from other blankets in the network. We show in
our experimental results that the proposed approximation can improve the sample
complexity of state-of-the-art scores when learning complex networks, where the
independence assumption between blanket variables is clearly incorrect.

third and fourth statistical moments, as indicators of structures caused by
turbulence, to examine the neutral hydrogen (HI) column density of a sample of
spiral galaxies selected from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS, Walter et

galaxy as a whole, divided into a function of radii and then into grids. We
create individual grid maps of kurtosis for each galaxy. To investigate the
relation between these moments and star formation, we compare these maps with
their far-ultraviolet images taken by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
satellite. We find that the moments are largely uniform across the galaxies, in
which the variation does not appear to trace any star forming regions. This
may, however, be due to the spatial resolution of our analysis, which could
potentially limit the scale of turbulent motions that we are sensitive to
greater than ~700 pc. From comparison between the moments themselves, we find
that the gas motions in our sampled galaxies are largely supersonic. This
analysis also shows that Burkhart et al. (2010)'s methods may be applied not
just to dwarf galaxies but also to normal spiral galaxies.

discontinuous phase transitions at the same transition point has been observed
in diverse complex systems. Previous studies of the HPTs on complex networks
mainly focused on whether the order parameter is continuous or discontinuous.
However, more careful and fundamental questions on the critical behaviors of
the HPT such as how the divergences of the susceptibility and of the
correlation size are affected by the discontinuity of the order parameter have
been addressed. Here, we consider a generalized epidemic model that is known to
exhibit a discontinuous transition as a spinodal transition. Performing
extensive numerical simulations and using finite-size scaling analysis, we
examine diverging behaviors of the susceptibility and the correlation size. We
find that when there is one infectious node and under a certain condition, the
order parameter can exhibit a discontinuous jump but does not exhibit any
critical behavior before or after the jump. This feature differs from what we
observed in HPTs in the percolation pruning process. However, critical behavior
appears in the form of a power-law behavior of the outbreak size distribution.
The mean outbreak size, corresponding to the susceptibility, diverge following
the conventional percolation behavior. Thus a mixed-order transition occurs.
The hyperscaling relation does not hold.

is the verification of safety and liveness properties in this model; despite
the extensive research effort, some basic problems remain open, which is
exemplified by the open complexity status of the reachability problem. The
liveness problems are known to be closely related to the reachability problem,
and many structural properties of nets that are related to liveness have been
studied. Somewhat surprisingly, the decidability status of the problem if a net
is structurally live, i.e. if there is an initial marking for which it is live,
has remained open, as also a recent paper (Best and Esparza, 2016) emphasizes.

the space of measures on a compact convex set using ideas from the theory of
operator algebras. This yields an extension of Cartier's dilation theorem to
the non-separable setting, as well as a non-separable version of
\v{S}a\v{s}kin's theorem from approximation theory. We show that a slight
variant of this order characterizes the representations of a commutative
C*-algebra that have the unique extension property relative to a set of
generators. This reduces the commutative case of Arveson's hyperrigidity
conjecture to the question of whether measures that are maximal with respect to
the classical Choquet order are also maximal with respect to this new order. An
example shows that these orders are not the same in general.

$^{209}$Bi and $^{198}$Pt targets. The absorption cross-sections are calculated
using the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channels (CDCC) method with different
choices of short range imaginary potentials to get the ICF, CF and TF

deuteron-ICF/deuteron-capture are of similar magnitude as the
$\alpha$-ICF/$\alpha$-capture, in case of $^{6}$Li projectile, while the
cross-sections for triton-ICF/triton-capture is more dominant than
$\alpha$-ICF/$\alpha$-capture in case of $^{7}$Li projectile. Both these
observations are also corroborated by the experimental data. The ratio of ICF
to TF cross-sections, which defines the value of fusion suppression factor is
found to be in agreement with the data available from the literature. The
cross-section ratio of CF/TF and ICF/TF show opposite behavior, the former
decreases while the latter increases as the energy is lowered, which shows the
dominance of ICF at below barrier energies. We have also studied the
correlation of the ICF cross-sections with the non-capture breakup (NCBU)
cross-sections as a function of energy, which shows that the NCBU is more
significant than ICF at below barrier energies.

  Asymptotic Analysis and Its Implications","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale cloud radio access network (LS-CRAN) is a highly promising
next-generation cellular network architecture whereby lots of base stations
(BSs) equipped with a massive antenna array are connected to a cloud-computing
based central processor unit via digital front/backhaul links. This paper
studies an asymptotic behavior of downlink (DL) performance of a LS-CRAN with
three practical constraints: 1) limited transmit power, 2) limited
front/backhaul capacity, and 3) limited pilot resource. As an asymptotic
performance measure, the scaling exponent of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is derived for interference-free
(IF), maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), and zero-forcing (ZF) operations. Our
asymptotic analysis reveals four fundamental operating regimes and the
performances of both MRT and ZF operations are fundamentally limited by the UL
transmit power for estimating user's channel state information, not the DL
transmit power. We obtain the conditions that MRT or ZF operation becomes
interference-free, i.e., order-optimal with three practical constraints.
Specifically, as higher UL transmit power is provided, more users can be
associated and the data rate per user can be increased simultaneously while
keeping the order-optimality as long as the total front/backhaul overhead is
$\Omega(N^{\eta_{\rm{bs}}+\eta_{\rm{ant}}+\eta_{\rm{user}}+\frac{2}{\alpha}\rho^{\rm{ul}}})$
and $\Omega(N^{\eta_{\rm{user}}-\eta_{\rm{bs}}})$ pilot resources are
available. It is also shown that how the target quality-of-service (QoS) in
terms of SINR and the number of users satisfying the target QoS can
simultaneously grow as the network size increases and the way how the network
size increases under the practical constraints, which can provide meaningful
insights for future cellular systems.

close the hierarchy, resulting a set of coupled kinetic equations for $f_{1}$

spectral domain of current optical interferometers by offering the L and M
bands in addition to the N band. This will open a wide wavelength domain,
ranging from 2.8 to 13 um, exploring angular scales as small as 3 mas (L band)

Observatoire de la C\^ote d'Azur in Nice (France), and has entered very
recently its testing phase in laboratory. This paper summarizes the equations
describing the MATISSE signal and the associated sources of noise. The
specifications and the expected performances of the instrument are then

the VLTI infrastructure, including transmission and contrast degradation
budgets. In addition, we present the different MATISSE simulation tools that
will be made available to the future users.

a slightly weaker version IHOL for the uniformly elliptic fully nonlinear case

the first part, we use IHOL for unbounded RHS to develop a Caffarelli's
""Lipschitz implies $C^{1,\alpha}$"" approach to prove Ladyzhenskaya-Uraltseva
boundary gradient type estimates for functions in $S^{*}(\gamma, f)$ that
vanishes on the boundary. Here, unbounded RHS means that $f\in L^{q}$ with
$q>n$. This extends the celebrated Krylov's boundary gradient estimate proved
in \cite{Krylov}. A Phragm\'en-Lindel\""of classification result for solutions
in half spaces is recovered from these estimates. Moreover, a H\""older estimate
up to the boundary (in the half-ball) for $u(x)/x_{n}$ is obtained. In the
second part, we extend the previous results for functions in $S^{*}(\gamma,
\sigma, f)$ where $\gamma,f\in L^{q}$ with $q>n$ that have a $C^{1,Dini}$

Conventional multi-reference methods can treat active spaces that are often at
the upper limit of what is required for a proper treatment of species with
complex electronic structures, leaving no room for verifying their suitability.
In this work we address the issue of properly defining the active spaces in
such calculations, and introduce a protocol to determine optimal active spaces
based on the use of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm and
concepts of quantum information theory. We apply the protocol to elucidate the
electronic structure and bonding mechanism of volatile plutonium oxides
(PuO$_3$ and PuO$_2$(OH)$_2$), species associated with nuclear safety issues
for which little is known about the electronic structure and energetics. We
show how, within a scalar relativistic framework, orbital-pair correlations can
be used to guide the definition of optimal active spaces which provide an
accurate description of static/non-dynamic electron correlation, as well as to
analyse the chemical bonding beyond a simple orbital model. From this bonding
analysis we are able to show that the addition of oxo- or hydroxo-groups to the
plutonium dioxide species considerably changes the pi-bonding mechanism with
respect to the bare triatomics, resulting in bent structures with considerable
multi-reference character.

suggest that the union bound is affected by poor distance properties of a small

to temperatures much above the photon temperature such that neutrinos acquire
again an almost relativistic equation of state. The present equation of state
of the combined cosmon-neutrino fluid is very close to -1. In contrast, for

0.5 eV seems so far compatible with observation. For masses lower than this

reproduced by assuming that the bottom and muon fields have a sizable amount of

  Growing to Image Segmentation","CGIV 2016",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present in this paper an image segmentation approach that combines a fuzzy
semantic region classification and a context based region-growing. Input image
is first over-segmented. Then, prior domain knowledge is used to perform a
fuzzy classification of these regions to provide a fuzzy semantic labeling.
This allows the proposed approach to operate at high level instead of using
low-level features and consequently to remedy to the problem of the semantic
gap. Each over-segmented region is represented by a vector giving its
corresponding membership degrees to the different thematic labels and the whole
image is therefore represented by a Regions Partition Matrix. The segmentation
is achieved on this matrix instead of the image pixels through two main phases:
focusing and propagation. The focusing aims at selecting seeds regions from
which information propagation will be performed. Thepropagation phase allows to
spread toward others regions and using fuzzy contextual information the needed
knowledge ensuring the semantic segmentation. An application of the proposed
approach on mammograms shows promising results

biology and has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from
microbes to humans. The mechanisms for genome rearrangement events remain
unclear. Lots of comparisons have been conducted among different species. To
reveal the mechanisms for rearrangement events, comparison of different
individuals/strains within the same species or genus (pan-genomes) is more
helpful since they are much closer to each other. Results: We study the
mechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different
strains within the same species. We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among
different strains of the same specie. We find an interesting phenomenon that
long (larger than 10,000 bp) inversion regions are flanked by a pair of
Inverted Repeats (IRs) (with lengths ranging from 385 bp to 27476 bp) which are
often Insertion Sequences (ISs).This mechanism can also explain why the
breakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. We study the prevalence of the
phenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. The other
observation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition
and inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also
associated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends
of the swapped regions remain unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first
time such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.

emission of the aCen binary system in all six available frequency bands during
Cycle2 in 2014/15. Since ALMA is an interferometer, the multi-telescope array
is particularly suited for the observation of point sources. With its large
collecting area, the sensitivity is high enough to allow the observation of
nearby main-sequence stars at submm/mm wavelengths for the first time. The
comparison of the observed spectral energy distributions with theoretical model
computations provides the chromospheric structure in terms of temperature and
density above the stellar photosphere and the quantitative understanding of the
primary emission processes. Both stars were detected and resolved at all ALMA
frequencies. For both aCenA and B, the existence and location of the
temperature minima, firstly detected from space with Herschel, are well
reproduced by the theoretical models of this paper. For aCenB, the temperature
minimum is deeper than for A and occurs at a lower height in the atmosphere,
but for both stars, Tmin/Teff is consistently lower than what is derived from
optical and UV data. The submm/mm emission of the aCen stars is indeed very
well reproduced by modified chromospheric models of the Quiet Sun. This most
likely means that the non-radiative heating mechanisms of the upper atmosphere

connected subgraphs of a subdivision of a graph $H$. They are related to many
classes of geometric intersection graphs, e.g., interval graphs, circular-arc
graphs, split graphs, and chordal graphs.
  We negatively answer the 25-year-old question of Bir\'{o} et al. which asks
if $H$-graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, for a fixed graph $H$. We
prove that it is NP-complete if $H$ contains the diamond graph as a minor. We
provide a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $T$-graphs, for each fixed tree
$T$. When $T$ is a star $S_d$ of degree $d$, we have an $O(n^{3.5})$-time
algorithm.
  We give FPT- and XP-time algorithms solving the minimum dominating set
problem on $S_d$-graphs and $H$-graphs parametrized by $d$ and the size of $H$,
respectively. The algorithm for $H$-graphs adapts to an XP-time algorithm for
the independent set and the independent dominating set problems on $H$-graphs.
  If $H$ contains the double-triangle as a minor, we prove that $H$-graphs are
GI-complete and that the clique problem is APX-hard. The clique problem can be
solved in polynomial time if $H$ is a cactus graph. When a graph $G$ has a
Helly $H$-representation, the clique problem can be solved in polynomial time.
  We show that both the $k$-clique and the list $k$-coloring problems are
solvable in FPT-time on $H$-graphs (parameterized by $k$ and the treewidth of
$H$). In fact, these results apply to classes of graphs with treewidth bounded
by a function of the clique number.
  We observe that $H$-graphs have at most $n^{O(\|H\|)}$ minimal separators
which allows us to apply the meta-algorithmic framework of Fomin et al. (2015)
to show that for each fixed $t$, finding a maximum induced subgraph of
treewidth $t$ can be done in polynomial time. When $H$ is a cactus, we improve
the bound to $O(\|H\|n^2)$.

interest recently for zero-stray-field spintronic devices, and for their rich
spin dynamics. Generally, the application of antiferromagnetic media for
information memories and storage requires a heterostructure with a
ferromagnetic layer for readout through the exchange-bias field. In
magnetoelectric and multiferroic antiferromagnets, the exchange coupling exerts
an additional impediment (energy barrier) to magnetization reversal by the
applied magnetoelectric energy. We proposed and verified a method to overcome
this barrier. We controlled the energy required for switching the magnetic
domains in magnetoelectric \cro films by compensating the exchange-coupling
energy from the ferromagnetic layer with the Zeeman energy of a small
volumetric spontaneous magnetization found for the sputtered \cro films. Based
on a simplified phenomenological model of the field-cooling process, the
magnetic and electric fields required for switching could be tuned. As an

only approximately. We show that for valuations that pointwise approximate a
gross substitutes valuation (in fact even a linear valuation), optimal social
welfare cannot be approximated to within a subpolynomial factor and demand

then provide several positive results by imposing additional structure on the

approximation, and/or using more powerful oracle access to the valuations. For
example, we prove that the performance of the greedy algorithm degrades
gracefully for near-linear valuations with approximately decreasing marginal
values, that with demand queries, approximate welfare guarantees for XOS
valuations degrade gracefully for valuations that are pointwise close to XOS,
and that the performance of the Kelso-Crawford auction degrades gracefully for
valuations that are close to various subclasses of gross substitutes

presence of an external (guide) magnetic field in the direction of the main
current is not well understood. In thin electron current sheets (ECS)
(thickness ~ an electron inertial length) formed in collisionless magnetic
reconnection, electron shear flow instabilities (ESFI) are potential candidates
for providing an anomalous dissipation mechanism which can break the frozen-in
condition of the magnetic field affecting the structure and rate of
reconnection. We investigate the evolution of ESFI in guide field magnetic
reconnection. The properties of the resulting plasma turbulence and their
dependence on the strength of the guide field are studied. Utilizing 3-D
electron-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of ECS we show that, unlike the case
of ECS self-consistently embedded in anti-parallel magnetic fields, the
evolution of thin ECS in the presence of a guide field (equal to the asymptotic
value of the reconnecting magnetic field or larger) is dominated by high wave
number non-tearing mode instabilities. The latter cause the development of,
first, a wavy structure of the ECS. The turbulence, developed later, consists
of current filaments and electron flow vortices. As a result of the nonlinear
evolution of the instability, the ECS broadens simultaneously with its
flattening in the central region mimicking a viscous-like turbulent
dissipation. Later, the flattened ECS bifurcates. During the time of the
bifurcation, the rate of the change of the mean electron flow velocity is
proportional to the magnitude of the flow velocity, suggesting a resistive-like
dissipation. The turbulence energy cascades to shorter wavelengths
preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the guide magnetic field. The
degree of anisotropy of the turbulence was found to increase with the
increasing strength of the guide field.

Flux Coordinate Independent (FCI) parallel derivative operator with
arbitrary-shaped material geometry in general 3D magnetic fields. The FCI
method constructs a finite difference scheme for $\nabla_\Vert$ by following
field lines between planes and interpolating within planes. Doing so removes
the need for field-aligned coordinate systems that suffer from singularities in
the metric tensor at null points in the magnetic field (or equivalently, when
$q \to \infty$). One cost of this method is that as the field lines are not on
the mesh, they may leave the domain at any point between neighbouring planes,
complicating the application of boundary conditions.
  The Leg Value Fill (LVF) boundary condition scheme presented here involves an
extrapolation/interpolation of the boundary value onto the field line end
point. The usual finite difference scheme can then be used unmodified. We
implement the LVF scheme in BOUT++ and use the Method of Manufactured Solutions
to verify the implementation in a rectangular domain, and show that the error
scaling of the finite difference scheme isn't modified. The use of LVF for
arbitrary wall geometry is outlined.
  We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the FCI approach in
non-axisymmetric configurations for a simple diffusion model in a ""straight
stellarator"" magnetic field. A Gaussian blob diffuses along the field lines,
tracing out flux surfaces. Dirichlet boundary conditions impose a last closed
flux surface (LCFS) that confines the density. Including a poloidal limiter
moves the LCFS to a smaller radius.
  The expected scaling of the numerical perpendicular diffusion, which is a
consequence of the FCI method, in stellarator-like geometry is recovered. A
novel technique for increasing the parallel resolution during post-processing
is also described.

in time-evolving networks defined by the positions of self-propelled agents
interacting in real space. In order to understand the impact of mobility in the
synchronization process on general grounds, we introduce a simple model of
self-propelled hard disks performing persistent random walks in 2$d$ space and
carrying an internal Kuramoto phase oscillator. For non-interacting particles,
self-propulsion accelerates synchronization. The competition between agent
mobility and excluded volume interactions gives rise to a richer scenario,
leading to an optimal self-propulsion speed. We identify two extreme dynamic
regimes where synchronization can be understood from theoretical
considerations. A systematic analysis of our model quantifies the departure
from the latter ideal situations and characterizes the different mechanisms
leading the evolution of the system. We show that the synchronization of
locally coupled mobile oscillators generically proceeds through coarsening
verifying dynamic scaling and sharing strong similarities with the phase
ordering dynamics of the 2$d$ XY model following a quench. Our results shed
light into the generic mechanisms leading the synchronization of mobile agents,

and algorithm instructs each robot to move in every step, unless it is already
at the gathering location), that gathers all non-faulty robots in
semi-synchronous model without any agreement in the coordinate system and with
weak multiplicity detection (i.e., a robot can only detect that either there is
one or more robot at a location) in the presence of at most $n-1$ faulty robots
for $n\geqslant 3$. We show that the required capability for gathering robots
is minimal in the above model, since relaxing it further makes gathering
impossible to solve.
  Also, we introduce an intermediate scheduling model \textit{ASYNC$_{IC}$}
between the asynchronous ( i.e., no instantaneous movement or computation) and
the semi-synchronous (i.e., both instantaneous movement and computation) as the
asynchronous model with instantaneous computation. Then we propose another
algorithm in \textit{ASYNC$_{IC}$} model for gathering all non-faulty robots
with weak multiplicity detection without any agreement on the coordinate system
in the presence of at most $\lfloor n/2\rfloor-2$ faulty robots for $n\geqslant
7$.

was for many years related to high-power equipment. Examples are the protection
of powering equipment from overheating (magnets, power converters, high-current
cables), of superconducting magnets from damage after a quench and of
klystrons. The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent,
although there was one paper that discussed beam-induced damage for the SLAC
linac (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) as early as in 1967. It is related
to the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators, to the emission
of synchrotron light by electron-positron accelerators and to the increase of
energy stored in the beam. Designing a machine protection system requires an
excellent understanding of accelerator physics and operation to anticipate
possible failures that could lead to damage. Machine protection includes beam
and equipment monitoring, a system to safely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping
the beam or stopping the beam at low energy) and an interlock system providing
the glue between these systems. The most recent accelerator, LHC, will operate
with about 3 x 10$^{14}$ protons per beam, corresponding to an energy stored in
each beam of 360 MJ. This energy can cause massive damage to accelerator
equipment in case of uncontrolled beam loss, and a single accident damaging
vital parts of the accelerator could interrupt operation for years. This
lecture will provide an overview of the requirements for protection of
accelerator equipment and introduces various protection systems. Examples are
mainly from LHC and ESS.

Anderson's problem of an interacting impurity level coupled to an infinite bath

infinite model is then obtained from the ensemble averaged self-energy. Using
Friedel's sum rule, we show that the particle number constraint, a central

Kondo physics within DED. Using the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)
method as a benchmark, we show that DED yields excellent spectra, both inside
and outside the Kondo regime for a moderate number of bath sites. Only for very
strong correlations ($U/\Gamma\gg10$) does the number of bath sites needed to
achieve good quantitative agreement become too large to be computationally
feasible.

topology in nonsymmorphic all-dielectric photonic-crystals with space-time
reversal symmetry, which can be realized at infrared and microwave frequencies.
Double degeneracy of all Bloch states in high symmetry planes is achieved via
nonsymmorphic screw symmetries despite the fundamental obstacle of no Kramers
degeneracy in photonic crystals. Two orthogonal screw axes lead to 3D $Z_2$
Dirac points on high symmetry Brillouin zone boundary lines. On the other hand,
$Z_2$ line-nodes emerge as protected twofold degeneracy of Bloch bands with
opposite mirror parities on the $k_z=0$ plane. The lowest frequency line-node
is deterministic because of a degenerate-partner switching mechanism guaranteed
by the fundamental properties of Maxwell equations and the nonsymmorphic screw
symmetry. A pair of Fermi arcs with opposite chirality due to $Z_2$ topological
Dirac points emerge below the light-line on (100) and (010)
photonic-crystal-air interfaces. These robust surface states offer an unique
opportunity to realize an ""open cavity"" with strong interaction between quantum
emitters and engineered vacuum with nontrivial Berry phases --- an important
step toward topological states of strongly interacting bosons. Realistic
calculation for resonant coupling between cavity-photons and phonons in boron
nitride thin film yields ultrastrong coupling with vacuum Rabi splitting
reaching to $23\%$ of photon frequency. We also show that type-II Dirac cones
have anomalous valley selective refraction: birefringence with both positive

include residual gas stripping, H+ capture and acceleration, field stripping,
black-body radiation and the recently discovered intra-beam stripping

$N$-body problems for particle-based methods. FMM is more than an $N$-body
solver, however. Recent efforts to view the FMM as an elliptic Partial
Differential Equation (PDE) solver have opened the possibility to use it as a
preconditioner for a broader range of applications. FMM can solve Helmholtz
problems with optimal $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ complexity, has compute-bound
inner kernels, and highly asynchronous communication patterns. The combination
of these features makes FMM an interesting candidate as a preconditioner for
sparse solvers on architectures of the future. The use of FMM as a
preconditioner allows us to use lower order multipole expansions than would be
required as a solver because individual solves need not be accurate. This
reduces the amount of computation and communication significantly and makes the
time-to-solution competitive with state-of-the-art preconditioners.
Furthermore, the high asynchronicity of FMM allows it to scale to much larger
core counts than factorization-based and multilevel methods. We describe our
tests in reproducible details with freely available codes.

at the base-station is large, and generally much larger than the number of
spatially multiplexed data streams to/from the users. It has been observed that
in many realistic propagation scenarios as well as in spatially correlated
channel models used in standardizations, although the user channel vectors have
a very high-dim $M$, they lie on low-dim subspaces due to their limited angular
spread. This low-dim subspace structure remains stable across many coherence
blocks and can be exploited in several ways to improve the system performance.
A main challenge, however, is to estimate this signal subspace from samples of
users' channel vectors as fast and efficiently as possible. In a recent work,
we addressed this problem and proposed a very effective novel algorithm
referred to as Approximate Maximum-Likelihood (AML), which was formulated as a
semi-definite program (SDP). In this paper, we address two problems left open
in our previous work: computational complexity and tracking. The algorithm
proposed in this paper is reminiscent of Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV)
problem in Compressed Sensing and is proved to be equivalent to the AML
Algorithm for sufficiently dense angular grids. It has also a very low
computational complexity and is able to track sharp transitions in the channel
statistics very quickly. Although mainly motivated by massive MIMO
applications, our proposed algorithm is of independent interest in other
related subspace estimation applications. We assess the estimation/tracking
performance of our proposed algorithm empirically via numerical simulations,
especially in practically relevant situations where a direct implementation of
the SDP would be infeasible in real-time. We also compare the performance of
our algorithm with other related subspace estimation algorithms in the
literature.

algorithms for classification and prediction. In this paper, we show a
connection between boosting and kernel-based methods, highlighting both
theoretical and practical applications. In the context of $\ell_2$ boosting, we
start with a weak linear learner defined by a kernel $K$. We show that boosting
with this learner is equivalent to estimation with a special {\it boosting
kernel} that depends on $K$, as well as on the regression matrix, noise
variance, and hyperparameters. The number of boosting iterations is modeled as
a continuous hyperparameter, and fit along with other parameters using standard
techniques.
  We then generalize the boosting kernel to a broad new class of boosting
approaches for more general weak learners, including those based on the
$\ell_1$, hinge and Vapnik losses. The approach allows fast hyperparameter
tuning for this general class, and has a wide range of applications, including
robust regression and classification. We illustrate some of these applications
with numerical examples on synthetic and real data.

derived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat
from the best-fit values derived from WMAP data. These shifts are driven by
features in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had
never before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We investigate
these shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and
to understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the
optical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium $\tau$, the baryon density
$\omega_{\rm b}$, the matter density $\omega_{\rm m}$, the angular size of the
sound horizon $\theta_*$, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum,
$n_{\rm s}$, and $A_{\rm s}e^{-2\tau}$ (where $A_{\rm s}$ is the amplitude of
the primordial power spectrum), we examine the change in best-fit values
between a WMAP-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment
$\ell<800$ in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale
data set ($\ell<2500$ Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on
$\tau$ of $0.07\pm0.02$. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1$\sigma$
expected dispersion for each parameter, are $\{\Delta \tau, \Delta A_{\rm s}
e^{-2\tau}, \Delta n_{\rm s}, \Delta \omega_{\rm m}, \Delta \omega_{\rm b},
\Delta \theta_*\} = \{-1.7, -2.2, 1.2, -2.0, 1.1, 0.9\}$, with a $\chi^2$ value
of 8.0. We find that this $\chi^2$ value is exceeded in 15% of our simulated
data sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2$\sigma$ in 9% of
simulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing
$\ell<800$ instead to $\ell>800$, or splitting at a different multipole, yields
similar results. We examine the $\ell<800$ model residuals in the $\ell>800$

Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary constraints for a Lagrangian submanifold
of arbitrary dimension. Previously, such invariants were known only in
dimensions $2$ and $3$ from the work of Welschinger. Our approach does not
require the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can
use such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also,
non-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints
and Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an
anti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to
invariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances.
  The main obstacle to defining open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary
constraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of $J$-holomorphic disks.
Unlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not
cancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the
technique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on
Lagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling. At the same time and
independently, gauge equivalence classes of bounding chains play the role of
boundary constraints, in place of the cohomology classes that usually serve as
constraints in Gromov-Witten theory. A crucial step in our construction is to
identify a canonical up to gauge equivalence family of ""point-like"" bounding
chains, which specialize in dimensions $2$ and $3$ to the point constraints
considered by Welschinger.

(FM-HSDM), a new member to the HSDM family of algorithms, for solving affinely
constrained minimization tasks in real Hilbert spaces, where convex smooth and
non-smooth losses compose the objective function. FM-HSDM offers sequences of
estimates which converge weakly and, under certain hypotheses, strongly to
solutions of the task at hand. Fixed-point theory, variational inequalities and
affine-nonexpansive mappings are utilized to devise a scheme that accommodates
affine constraints in a more versatile way than state-of-the-art primal-dual
techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers do. Recursions
can be tuned to score low computational footprints, well-suited for large-scale
optimization tasks, without compromising convergence guarantees. In contrast to
its HSDM's precursors, FM-HSDM enjoys Fej\'er monotonicity, the step-size
parameter stays constant across iterations to promote convergence speed-ups of
the sequence of estimates to a minimizer, while only Lipschitzian continuity,
and not strong monotonicity, of the derivative of the smooth-loss function is
needed to ensure convergence. Results on the rate of convergence to an optimal
point are also presented.

classical paths from point $y$ to point $x$ in time $t$ and calculate the
corresponding action and amplitude functions. A large part of space-time turns
out to be classically inaccessible, and the boundary of this region is a
caustic of an unusual type, where the amplitude vanishes instead of diverging.
We show that this curve is the limit of caustics in the usual sense when the
reflecting boundary is approximated by steeply rising smooth potentials. Then,
to improve the WKB approximation we construct the propagator for initial data
in momentum space; this requires classifying the interesting variety of
classical paths with initial momentum $p$ arriving at $x$ after time $t$. The
two approximate propagators are compared by applying them to Gaussian initial
packets by numerical integration; the results show physically expected
behavior, with advantages to the momentum-based propagator in the classically

aerodynamic stall phenomena imply the existence of the equilibrium orientation
irrespective of the reference velocity. The equilibrium orientation, however,
is not in general unique, and this may trigger an aircraft loss-of-control for
specific reference velocities. Conditions that ensure the local and the global
uniqueness of the equilibrium orientation are stated. We show that the
uniqueness of the equilibrium orientation is intimately related to the
so-called spherical equivalency, i.e. the existence of a thrust change of
variable rendering the direction of the transformed external force independent
of the vehicle's orientation, as in the case of spherical shapes. Once this
transformation is applied, control laws for reference velocities can be
designed. These laws extend the so-called vectored--thrust control paradigm
%developed for systems subject to orientation-independent external forces, e.g.
spherical shapes, to the case of generic body shapes subject to steady

telescopes. All sources are variable across all frequency bands with amplitudes
increasing with frequency up to rest frame frequencies of around 60 - 80 GHz as
expected by shock-in-jet models. Compared to FSRQs, BL Lacs show systematically
lower variability amplitudes, brightness temperatures and Doppler factors at
lower frequencies, while the difference vanishes towards higher ones. The time
scales appear similar for the two classes. The distribution of spectral indices
appears flatter or more inverted at higher frequencies for BL Lacs. Evolving
synchrotron self-absorbed components can naturally account for the observed
spectral variability. We find that the Fermi-detected sources show larger
variability amplitudes as well as brightness temperatures and Doppler factors,
than non-detected ones. Flux densities at 86.2 and 142.3 GHz correlate with 1
GeV fluxes at a significance level better than 3sigma, implying that gamma rays
are produced very close to the mm-band emission region.

method works for both ill-posed Cauchy problems for some quasilinear PDEs of

problem. Recently, sub-sampled Newton methods have emerged to attract much
attention for optimization due to their efficiency at each iteration, rectified
a weakness in the ordinary Newton method of suffering a high cost at each
iteration while commanding a high convergence rate. In this work we propose two
new efficient Newton-type methods, Refined Sub-sampled Newton and Refined
Sketch Newton. Our methods exhibit a great advantage over existing sub-sampled
Newton methods, especially when Hessian-vector multiplication can be calculated
efficiently. Specifically, the proposed methods are shown to converge
superlinearly in general case and quadratically under a little stronger
assumption. The proposed methods can be generalized to a unifying framework for
the convergence proof of several existing sub-sampled Newton methods, revealing
new convergence properties. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of
our methods on several standard datasets and the results show consistent
improvement in computational efficiency.

advancements in Internet of Things, modern mobile devices have shown a
favorable prospect for on-the-go service provisioning. However, there is much
to be done to realize this. A detailed, dynamic, and lightweight service
description is an important requirement for automatic and efficient discovery,
selection, and subsequent provisioning of services over mobile devices.
Traditional approaches for service description are usually not directly
adaptable to mobile environments owing to the latter's dynamic and distinct
nature. In this paper, we propose a dynamic, lightweight, extensible, and
detailed service description especially designed for mobile environments,
considering crucial aspects such as isolated data source, collaborator
partners, and hardware aspects along with the functional, non-functional,
business, and contextual aspects. The description has been partitioned along
these lines and various parts of the description are distributed between
service registries and the mobile service providers. An up-to-date and light
weight description has been achieved by this, without compromising on the
overall consistency of the description. A prototype of the proposed system has
been implemented with the intent of validating the feasibility of the approach.
Further, the proposed approach is suitable for a heterogeneous environment
comprising both wired and wireless systems.

level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this
reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of
intrinsic cause-effect power - integrated information ({\Phi}), and showing
that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to ""beat"" the
micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for {\Phi} across different spatial
and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible black boxes.
These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or
more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and
outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support
their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more
common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the
emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent
at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher
{\Phi} than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher
composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show
that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of {\Phi} across
several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple
biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle,
for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated
biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of
organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come
into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.
