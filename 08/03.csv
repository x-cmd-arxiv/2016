domain using cavity ring-down spectroscopy of a supersonically expanding
hydrocarbon plasma. In total, 19 (sub)bands of C$_6$H are presented, all
probing the vibrational manifold of the B$^2\Pi$ electronically excited state.
The assignments are guided by electronic spectra available from matrix
isolation work, isotopic substitution experiments (yielding also spectra for
$^{13}$C$_6$H and C$_6$D), predictions from ab initio calculations as well as
rotational fitting and vibrational contour simulations using the available
ground state parameters as obtained from microwave experiments. Besides the
$0_0^0$ origin band, three non-degenerate stretching vibrations along the
linear backbone of the C$_6$H molecule are assigned: the $\nu_6$ mode
associated with the C-C bond vibration and the $\nu_4$ and $\nu_3$ modes
associated with C$\equiv$C triple bonds. For the two lowest $\nu_{11}$ and
$\nu_{10}$ bending modes, a Renner-Teller analysis is performed identifying the
$\mu^2\Sigma$($\nu_{11}$) and both $\mu^2\Sigma$($\nu_{10}$) and
$\kappa^2\Sigma$($\nu_{10}$) components. In addition, two higher lying bending
modes are observed, which are tentatively assigned as $\mu^2\Sigma$($\nu_9$)
and $\mu^2\Sigma$($\nu_8$) levels. In the excitation region below the first
non-degenerate vibration ($\nu_6$), some $^2\Pi-^{2}\Pi$ transitions are
observed that are assigned as even combination modes of low-lying bending
vibrations. The same holds for a $^2\Pi-^{2}\Pi$ transition found above the
$\nu_6$ level. From these spectroscopic data and the vibronic analysis a
comprehensive energy level diagram for the B$^2\Pi$ state of C$_6$H is derived
and presented.

application to the enumeration of other combinatorial objects.
  Combinatorial maps, or simply maps, form a rich combinatorial model. They
have an intuitive and geometric definition, but are also related to some deep
algebraic structures. For instance, a special type of maps called
constellations provides a unifying framework for some enumeration problems
concerning factorizations in the symmetric group. Standing on a position where
many domains meet, maps can be studied using a large variety of methods, and
their enumeration can also help us count other combinatorial objects. This
thesis is a sampling from the rich results and connections in the enumeration
of maps.
  This thesis is structured into four major parts. The first part, including
Chapter 1 and 2, consist of an introduction to the enumerative study of maps.
The second part, Chapter 3 and 4, contains my work in the enumeration of
constellations, which are a special type of maps that can serve as a unifying
model of some factorizations of the identity in the symmetric group. The third
part, composed by Chapter 5 and 6, shows my research on the enumerative link
from maps to other combinatorial objects, such as generalizations of the Tamari
lattice and random graphs embeddable onto surfaces. The last part is the
closing chapter, in which the thesis concludes with some perspectives and
future directions in the enumerative study of maps.

tuning the diquark coupling strength, we study the interdependent evolution of
the quark Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap and dynamical mass as functions of
temperature and magnetic field. We find that magnetic field $B \gtrsim 0.02$
GeV$^2$ ($10^{18}$ G) leads to anomalous temperature behavior of the gap in the
gapless 2SC phase (moderately strong coupling), reminiscent of previous results
in the literature found in the limit of weak coupling without magnetic field.
The 2SC gap in the strong coupling regime is abruptly quenched at ultrahigh
magnetic field due to the mismatched Fermi surfaces of up and down quarks
imposed by charge neutrality and oscillation of the gap due to Landau level
quantization. The dynamical quark mass also displays strong oscillation and
magnetic catalysis at high magnetic field, although the latter effect is
tempered by nonzero temperature. We discuss the implications for newly born
compact stars with superconducting quark cores.

superconductivity have been strongly debated issues of iron-based
superconductors (FeSCs). Observation of C$_4$-symmetric antiferromagnetism in
violation of the inter-band nesting condition of spin-density waves in
superconducting ground state will require significant change in our
understanding of the mechanism of FeSC. The superconducting material
Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs, a bulk version of monolayer FeSC in contact with a perovskite
layer with its magnetism (T$_N$ ~ 50 K) and superconductivity (T$_c$ ~ 37 K)
coexisting at parent state, has no reported structural orthorhombic distortion
and thus makes a perfect system to look for theoretically expected C$_4$
magnetisms. Based on variable temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling
microscopy (SPSTM) with newly discovered imaging mechanism that removes the
static surface reconstruction (SR) pattern by fluctuating it rapidly with
spin-polarized tunneling current, we could visualize underlying C$_4$ symmetric
(2$\times$2) magnetic domains and its phase domain walls. We find that this
magnetic order is perfectly consistent with the plaquette antiferromagnetic
order in tetragonal Fe spin lattice expected from theories based on the
Heisenberg exchange interaction of local Fe moments and the quantum order by
disorder. The inconsistency of its modulation Q vectors from the nesting
condition also implies that the nesting-based C$_2$ symmetric magnetism is not
a unique prerequisite of high-T$_c$ FeSC. Furthermore, the plaquette
antiferromagnetic domain wall dynamics under the influence of small spin torque
effect of spin-polarized tunneling current are shown to be consistent with
theoretical simulation based on the extended Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.

presents challenges not encountered in the simulation of PDEs or SDEs. Indeed,
the roughness of the noise in conjunction with nonlinearities in the drift
typically make these equations particularly stiff. In practice, this means that
it is tricky to construct, operate, and validate numerical methods for SPDEs.
This is especially true if one is interested in path-dependent expected values,
long-time simulations, or in the simulation of SPDEs whose solutions have
constraints on their domains. To address these numerical issues, this paper
introduces a Markov jump process approximation for SPDEs, which we refer to as
the spectral random walk method (SPECTRWM). The accuracy and ergodicity of
SPECTRWM are verified in the context of a heat and overdamped Langevin SPDE,
respectively. We also apply the method to Burgers and KPZ SPDEs.

decision making whenever it is difficult, or inappropriate, to attach
probabilities to possible future scenarios. We show that, for each of these two
approaches and subject only to the convexity of the cost functions involved, it
is always the case that there exist two ""extreme"" scenarios whose costs
determine the outcome of the analysis in the sense we make clear. The results
of either analysis are therefore particularly sensitive to the cost functions
associated with these two scenarios, while being largely unaffected by those
associated with the remainder. Great care is therefore required in applications
to identify these scenarios and to consider their reasonableness.
  We also consider the relationship between the outcome of a least worst regret
and a Bayesian analysis, particularly in the case where the regret functions
associated with the scenarios largely differ from each other by shifts in their
arguments, as is the case in many applications.
  We study in detail the problem of determining an appropriate level of

occurs in quantum wavefunctions, where the tangled filaments are vortices
(nodal lines/phase singularities). The probability that a vortex loop is
knotted is found to increase with its length, and a wide gamut of knots from
standard tabulations occur. The results follow from computer simulations of
random superpositions of degenerate eigenstates of three simple quantum
systems: a cube with periodic boundaries, the isotropic 3-dimensional harmonic
oscillator and the 3-sphere. In the latter two cases, vortex knots occur
frequently, even in random eigenfunctions at relatively low energy, and are
constrained by the spatial symmetries of the modes. The results suggest that
knotted vortex structures are generic in complex 3-dimensional wave systems,
establishing a topological commonality between wave chaos, polymers and
turbulent Bose-Einstein condensates.

tackle these issues separately, we propose a hybrid network architecture to
jointly address them. Specifically, spatial representations are extracted by a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which, as analyzed in this paper, is able
to reduce person-specific biases caused by hand-crafted features (eg, SIFT and

stacked on top of these representations, regardless of the lengths of input
videos. The outputs of CNNs and LSTMs are further aggregated into a fusion
network to produce per-frame predictions of 12 AUs. Our network naturally
addresses the three issues, and leads to superior performance compared to
existing methods that consider these issues independently. Extensive
experiments were conducted on two large spontaneous datasets, GFT and BP4D,

report significant improvement over a standard multi-label CNN and

Improvements of both Young's modulus and tensile strength of up to 200 % were

found for three different types of SWNTs and two types of macrocycles.
Molecular dynamics simulations show that the polymer adopts an elongated

irrespective of the macrocycle chemical nature, whereas a more globular
structure is taken upon facing with either pristine SWNTs or supramolecular

estimation. Large-scale networks are spatially partitioned into overlapping
road sections. The traffic dynamics of each section is given by the switching
mode model (SMM) using a conservation principle, and the traffic state in each
section is estimated by a local agent. In the proposed filter, a consensus term
is applied to promote inter-agent agreement on overlapping sections. The new
filter, termed a (spatially) distributed local Kalman consensus filter (DLKCF),
is shown to maintain globally asymptotically stable (GAS) mean error dynamics
when all sections switch among observable modes. When a section is
unobservable, we show that the mean estimate of each state variable in the
section is ultimately bounded, which is achieved by exploring the interaction
between the properties of the traffic model and the measurement feedback of the
filter. Based on the above results, the boundedness of the mean estimation
error of the DLKCF under switching sequences with observable and unobservable
modes is established to address the overall performance of the filter.
Numerical experiments show the ability of the DLKCF to promote consensus,
increase estimation accuracy compared to a local filter, and reduce the
computational load compared to a centralized approach.

discovered with radial-velocity measurements. Using FORS2/VLT, we obtained
position measurements of the star in the plane of the sky that tightly
constrain its astrometric reflex motion caused by the super-Jupiter planet `b`
in a 1052-day orbit. This allows us to determine the mass of this planet to
$M_\mathrm{b} = 6.7^{+1.8}_{-1.5}\,M_\mathrm{J}$, which is $\sim$40 \% higher
than the minimum mass inferred from the radial-velocity orbit. Using new HARPS
radial-velocity measurements, we improve upon the orbital parameters of the
inner low-mass planets `d` and `e` and we determine the orbital period of the
outer giant planet `c` to $P_\mathrm{c}=7340$ days under the assumption of a
circular orbit. The preliminary minimum mass of planet `c` is $M_\mathrm{c}
\sin i = 6.8\,M_\mathrm{J}$ with an upper limit of $\sim$$39\,M_\mathrm{J}$
that we set using NACO/VLT high-contrast imaging. We also determine precise
parallaxes and relative proper motions for both GJ676A and its wide M3
companion GJ676B. Despite the probably mature age of the system, the masses and
projected separations ($\sim$0.1"" -- 0.4"") of planets `b` and `c` make them
promising targets for direct imaging with future instruments in space and on
extremely large telescopes. In particular, we estimate that GJ676A b and GJ676A
c are promising targets for directly detecting their reflected light with the
WFIRST space mission. Our study demonstrates the synergy of radial-velocity and
astrometric surveys that is necessary to identify the best targets for such a
mission.

researchers and clinicians in searching for diseases, primarily cancer. Scans
might be acquired with different equipment or at different times for prognosis
monitoring, with patient movement between scans, resulting in multiple datasets
that need to be registered. For these cases, we introduce a method for
volumetric registration using curvature flow. Multiple prostate datasets are
mapped to canonical solid spheres, which are in turn aligned and registered
through the use of identified landmarks on or within the gland. Theoretical
proof and experimental results show that our method produces homeomorphisms
with feature constraints. We provide thorough validation of our method by
registering prostate scans of the same patient in different orientations, from
different days and using different modes of MRI. Our method also provides the
foundation for a general group-wise registration using a standard reference,
defined on the complex plane, for any input. In the present context, this can
be used for registering as many scans as needed for a single patient or
different patients on the basis of age, weight or even malignant and
non-malignant attributes to study the differences in general population. Though
we present this technique with a specific application to the prostate, it is
generally applicable for volumetric registration problems.

After a quantum quench in a one-dimensional integrable model, the expectation
values of local observables are expected to relax to a Generalized Gibbs
Ensemble (GGE), constructed out of the conserved charges of the model.
Quenching to a free bosonic theory, it has been shown that the system indeed
relaxes to a GGE described by the momentum mode occupation numbers. We first
address the question whether the latter can be written directly in terms of
local charges and we find that, in contrast to the lattice case, this is not
possible in continuous field theories. We then investigate the less stringent
requirement of the existence of a sequence of truncated local GGEs that
converges to the correct steady state, in the sense of the expectation values
of the local observables. While we show that such a sequence indeed exists, in
order to unequivocally determine the so-defined GGE, we find that information
about the expectation value of the recently discovered quasi-local charges is
in the end necessary, the latter being the suitable generalization of the local
charges while passing from the lattice to the continuum. Lastly, we study the
locality properties of the GGE and show that the latter is completely
determined by the knowledge of the expectation value of a countable set of

wavelengths shorter than 300~nm observed with {\em HST}, which have important
effects on the photochemistry in the exoplanet atmospheres. The FUV line ratios
indicate that the transition region of GJ~832 is more biased to hotter material

opportunity for differential reproduction and survivorship of forms. Here we
apply a rigorous inference framework, drawn from population genetics, to
distinguish between two broad mechanisms of language change: drift and
selection. Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and
it may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic
forms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic
differences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the
population. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to
the 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English:
the regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and
syntactic variation in verbal negation. We show that we can reject stochastic
drift in favor of a selective force driving some of these language changes, but
not others. The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift
provides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change
than others. Our results suggest an important role for stochasticity in
language change, and they provide a null model against which selective theories

gene trees along a chromosome, while changes in selective pressure and
mutational rates for different genomic regions may lead to shifts in the
underlying mutational process. We propose the split score as a general method
for quantifying support for a particular phylogenetic relationship within a
genomic data set. Because the split score is based on algebraic properties of a
matrix of site pattern frequencies, it can be rapidly computed, even for data
sets that are large in the number of taxa and/or in the length of the
alignment, providing an advantage over other methods (e.g., maximum likelihood)
that are often used to assess such support. Using simulation we explore the
properties of the split score, including its dependence on sequence length,
branch length, size of a split and its ability to detect true splits in the

known Be star $\zeta$ Tau. 48 Librae shares several similarities with $\zeta$
Tau -- they are both early-type Be stars, they display shell characteristics in
their spectra, and they exhibit cyclic $V/R$ variations -- but has some marked
differences as well, such as a much denser and more extended disk, a much
longer $V/R$ cycle, and the absence of the so-called triple-peak features. We
aim to reproduce the photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observables
of 48 Librae with a self-consistent model, and to test the global oscillation
scenario for this target. Our calculations are carried out with the
three-dimensional NLTE radiative transfer code HDUST. We employ a rotationally
deformed, gravity-darkened central star, surrounded by a disk whose unperturbed
state is given by the VDD model. A two-dimensional global oscillation code is
then used to calculate the disk perturbation, and superimpose it on the
unperturbed disk. A very good, self-consistent fit to the time-averaged
properties of the disk is obtained with the VDD. The calculated perturbation
has a period $P = 12$ yr, which agrees with the observed period, and the
behaviour of the $V/R$ cycle is well reproduced by the perturbed model. The
perturbed model improves the fit to the photometric data and reproduces some
features of the observed spectroscopic data. Some suggestions to improve the
synthesized spectroscopy in a future work are given.

and socio-technical systems because of their role in improving uncertainty
management, accommodating multiple stakeholders, and increasing scalability and
evolvability. This departure from monolithic architectures provides a system
with more flexibility and robustness in response to uncertainties that it may
confront during its lifetime. Distributed architecture does not provide
benefits only, as it can increase cost and complexity of the system and result
in potential instabilities. The mechanisms behind this trade-off, however, are
analogous to those of the widely-studied transition from integrated to modular
architectures. In this paper, we use a conceptual decision framework that
unifies modularity and distributed architecture on a five-stage systems
architecture spectrum. We add an extensive computational layer to the framework
and explain how this can enhance decision making about the level of modularity
of the architecture. We then apply it to a simplified demonstration of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) fractionated satellite
program. Through simulation, we calculate the net value that is gained (or
lost) by migrating from a monolithic architecture to a distributed architecture
and show how this value changes as a function of uncertainties in the
environment and various system parameters. Additionally, we use Value at Risk
as a measure for the risk of losing the value of distributed architecture,
given its inherent uncertainty.

model in machine learning for text analysis. Inference for this model typically
involves a single-site collapsed Gibbs sampling step for latent variables
associated with observations. The efficiency of the sampling is critical to the
success of the model in practical large scale applications. In this article, we
introduce a blocking scheme to the collapsed Gibbs sampler for the LDA model
which can, with a theoretical guarantee, improve chain mixing efficiency. We
develop two procedures, an O(K)-step backward simulation and an O(log K)-step
nested simulation, to directly sample the latent variables within each block.
We demonstrate that the blocking scheme achieves substantial improvements in
chain mixing compared to the state of the art single-site collapsed Gibbs
sampler. We also show that when the number of topics is over hundreds, the
nested-simulation blocking scheme can achieve a significant reduction in
computation time compared to the single-site sampler.

  Footprint","17 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  C2CNT (Carbon dioxide to carbon nanotube) cement plants have been introduced
and analyzed which provide a significant economic incentive to eliminate the
massive CO2 greenhouse gas emissions of current plants and serves as a template
for carbon mitigation in other industrial manufacturing processes. Rather than
regarding CO2 as a costly pollutant, this is accomplished by treating CO2 as a
feedstock resource to generate valuable products (carbon nanotubes). The
exhaust from partial and full oxy-fuel cement plant configurations are coupled
to the inlet of a C2CNT chamber in which CO2 is transformed by electrolysis in
a molten carbonate electrolyte at a steel cathode and a nickel anode. In this
high yield 4e- per CO2 process, the CO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes at
the cathode, and pure oxygen at the anode that is looped back in improving the
cement line energy efficiency and rate of production. A partial oxy-fuel
process looping the pure oxygen back in through the plant calcinator has been
compared to a full oxy-fuel process in which it is looped back in through the
plant kiln. The second provides the advantage of easier retrofit, while the
first maximizes efficiency by minimizing the volume of gas throughput
(eliminating N2 from air). An upper limit to the electrical cost to drive C2CNT
electrolysis is USD70 based on Texas wind power costs, but will be lower with
fuel expenses when oxy-fuel plant energy improvements are taken account. The
current value of a ton of carbon nanotubes is substantially in excess of a ton
of cement. Hence a C2CNT cement plant consumes USD50 of electricity, emits no
CO2, and produces USD100 of cement and USD60,000 of carbon nanotubes per ton of
CO2 avoided. As the cement product ages, CO2 is spontaneously absorbed. This is
a powerful economic incentive, rather than economic cost, to mitigate climate
change through a carbon negative process.

We report the likely discovery of a giant planet with a mass of $m_{p}~\sin

planet HD 59686 Ab in a tight eccentric binary system severely challenges
standard giant planet formation theories and requires substantial improvements
to such theories in tight binaries. Otherwise, alternative planet formation
scenarios such as second generation planets or dynamical interactions in an
early phase of the system's lifetime should be seriously considered in order to

Contrary to the notion held by some of SOC models organising into a critical
state by re-arranging their spatial structure avalanche by avalanche, which may
be expected to result in large, non-trivial, system-spanning spatial
correlations in the quiescent state (between avalanches), correlations of
inactive particles in the quiescent state have a small amplitude that does not
increase with the system size, although they display (noisy) power law scaling
over a range linear in the system size. Self-organisation, however, does take
place as the (one-point) density of inactive particles organises into a
particular profile that is asymptotically independent of the driving location,
also demonstrated analytically in one dimension. Activity and its correlations,
on the other hand, display non-trivial long-ranged spatio-temporal scaling with
exponents that can be related to established results, in particular avalanche
size and duration exponents. The correlation length and amplitude are set by
the system size (confirmed analytically for some observables), as expected in
systems displaying finite size scaling. In one dimension, we find some

galaxies lensed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. Ionizing
radiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF
initiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot
really assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their
sizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end
slope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size
constraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the
detectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very
dependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain
detectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low
shear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably,
however, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies
and the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu>10 z~2-8 galaxies
seen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint
(~-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We
constrain their half-light radii to be <~30 mas (<160-240 pc). As a 2nd size
probe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major
shear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic
half-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely
faint z~2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset
(half-light radii conservatively <30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results
suggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities
for faint z~2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived
in many recent studies (by factors of ~2-3 and by dalpha>~0.1-0.3).

an optical wavelength image (B-band: 445 nm) and images from the Spitzer Space

recently, often differing in their observational features. Two classes appear
to stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective
temperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the
radiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different
locations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris
stream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.
In this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose
dynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic
stresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization
timescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\rm ev}/t_{\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\rm
h}/10^6 M_{\odot})^{-5/3} \beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\rm h}$ is the black hole mass
and $\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they
can lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between
circularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic
stresses efficiency $v_{\rm A}/v_{\rm c} \approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent
of $M_{\rm h}$ and $\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to
accelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.
Ballistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical
timescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is
sub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.
Finally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is
unable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution
into a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.

constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may
be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on $R_0$, we find it to be
$(7.97\pm0.15)\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and that
$v_0=(226.8\pm4.2)\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find that most of these
properties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive
to the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo.
We find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs

stellar absorption lines, reflects gas motions in stellar atmospheres. While in
cool stars, it is thought to be caused by convection zones immediately beneath
the stellar surface, the origin of macroturbulence in hot stars is still under
discussion. Recent works established a correlation between the
turbulent-to-total pressure ratio inside the envelope of stellar models and the
macroturbulent velocities observed in corresponding Galactic stars. To probe
this connection further, we evaluated the turbulent pressure that arises in the
envelope convective zones of stellar models in the mass range 1-125 Msun based
on the mixing-length theory and computed for metallicities of the Large and
Small Magellanic Cloud. We find that the turbulent pressure contributions in
models with these metallicities located in the hot high-luminosity part of the
Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram is lower than in similar models with solar
metallicity, whereas the turbulent pressure in low-metallicity models
populating the cool part of the HR-diagram is not reduced. Based on our models,
we find that the currently available observations of hot massive stars in the
Magellanic Clouds appear to support a connection between macroturbulence and
the turbulent pressure in stellar envelopes. Multidimensional simulations of
sub-surface convection zones and a larger number of high-quality observations
are necessary to test this idea more rigorously.

post-starburst sample more than double that selected by traditional $z\sim1$

fraction of dusty starburst galaxies selected through traditional methods.
While the traditional post-starburst fraction increased with increased global
density, the MOSFIRE-selected post-starburst fraction was found to be constant
in field, group, and cluster environments. However, this fraction relative to
the number of galaxies with ongoing star formation was observed to elevate in
the cluster environment. Post-starbursts selected with MOSFIRE were
predominantly found to exhibit moderately strong [OII] emission originating
from activity other than star formation. Such galaxies, termed K+A with
ImposteR [OII]-derived Star formation (KAIROS) galaxies, were found to be
considerably younger than traditionally-selected post-starbursts and likely

Neverethless, under the influence of an attractive interaction, a

function can arise. Here we study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a
generic Hubbard model with a flat band. We obtain an effective Hamiltonian for
the flat band physics by eliminating higher lying bands via perturbative
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. At first order in the interaction energy we
recover the usual procedure of projecting the interaction term onto the flat
band Wannier functions. We show that the BCS wave function is the exact ground
state of the projected interaction Hamiltonian and that the compressibility is
diverging as a consequence of an emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is
broken by second order interband transitions resulting in a finite
compressibility, which we illustrate for a one-dimensional ladder with two
perfectly flat bands. These results motivate a further approximation leading to
an effective ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The gauge-invariant result for the
superfluid weight of a flat band can be obtained from the ferromagnetic
Heisenberg model only if the maximally localized Wannier functions in the
Marzari-Vanderbilt sense are used. Finally, we prove an important inequality $D

color cuts. Motivated by the well-known relationship between rotation and
stellar activity, we use a multi-band periodogram analysis and visual vetting
to identify 271 sources that are likely rotating M dwarfs. We derive a new set
of polynomials relating M dwarf PS1 colors to fundamental stellar parameters
and use them to estimate the masses, distances, effective temperatures, and
bolometric luminosities of our sample. We present a catalog containing these
values, our measured rotation periods, and cross-matches to other surveys. Our
final sample spans periods of $\lesssim$1-130 days in stars with estimated
effective temperatures of $\approx$ 2700-4000 K. Twenty-two of our sources have
X-ray cross-matches, and they are found to be relatively X-ray bright as would
be expected from selection effects. Our data set provides evidence that
Kepler-based searches have not been sensitive to very slowly-rotating stars
($P_{\rm rot} \gtrsim 70$ d), implying that the observed emergence of very slow
rotators in studies of low-mass stars may be a systematic effect. We also see a
lack of low-amplitude ($<$2%) variability in objects with intermediate (10-40
d) rotation periods, which, considered in conjunction with other observational
results, may be a signpost of a loss of magnetic complexity associated with a
phase of rapid spin-down in intermediate-age M dwarfs. This work represents
just a first step in exploring stellar variability in data from the PS1-MDS

various cancer hallmarks like self-sufficiency of growth factor production for
angiogenesis and reprogramming of energy-metabolism for aerobic glycolysis.
This heterogeneity has consequences for diagnosis, treatment, and disease
progression.
  Methods: We introduce the double goods game to study the dynamics of these
traits using evolutionary game theory. We model glycolytic acid production as a
public good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF
production as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results
in three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic
non-angiogenic.
  Results: We classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes:
(1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell
types. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear
goods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that
considered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation.
  Conclusion: The cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the
importance of timing for anti-glycolysis treatments like lonidamine. The
existence of qualitatively different dynamic regimes highlights the order
effects of treatments. In particular, we consider the potential of vascular
renormalization as a neoadjuvant therapy before follow up with interventions
like buffer therapy.

with the longer wavelength ultraviolet luminosity of the stars. Although disk
flaring affects the PAH luminosity, it is not a factor in the luminosity of the
OH and CO emission. These properties are consistent with models of
UV-irradiated disk atmospheres. We also find that the transition disks in our
sample, which have large optically thin inner regions, have lower OH and CO
luminosities than non-transition disk sources with similar ultraviolet
luminosities. This result, while tentative given the small sample size, is
consistent with the interpretation that transition disks lack a gaseous disk

0.07"" (100 x 30 AU); it is interpreted as a disk viewed almost edge-on.
Optically thick thermal emission from ~500 K dust is the most plausible source
of the continuum, even at frequencies as low as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most
likely in the range 0.02 to 0.2 Mo. A rich spectrum of molecular lines is
detected, mostly from sulfur- and silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS,
but also including vibrationally excited CO and several unidentified
transitions. Lines with upper energy levels E_U > 500 K appear in emission and
are symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5 km/sec, while lines with E_U
< 500 K appear as blueshifted absorption features against the continuum,
indicating that they originate in outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a
velocity gradient along the major axis of the disk that is consistent with
rotation around a 5-7 Mo central object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and
the existence of a 100 AU disk around it are difficult to reconcile with the
model in which SrcI and the nearby Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected from

extensive multi-band, archival photometry and the Super-WASP project and
high-resolution spectroscopy obtained from the HARPS and CORALIE spectrographs.

analysis was performed. The light and radial velocity curves were simultanously
analysed with the Wilson-Devinney code. The resulting highly precise stellar
parameters were used for a detailed comparison with PARSEC, MESA, and GARSTEC

the leading twist approach of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). In

prediction of this picture is that radio pulsars of high magnetic field should

with strong pulsations appearing for the first time above 2.5 keV, with
phase-averaged emission detectable up to 25 keV. By comparing Swift-XRT and

segment to provide higher capacity for new packet switched services. As a
result, packet switched sessions with multiple diverse traffic flows such as
concurrentvoice and data, or video and data being transmitted to the same user
are a likely commonplace cellular packet data scenario. In HSDPA, Radio Access
Network (RAN) buffer management schemes are essential to support the end-to-end
QoS of such sessions. Hence in this paper we present the end-to-end performance
study of a proposed RAN buffer management scheme for multi-flow sessions via
dynamic system-level HSDPA simulations. The scheme is an enhancement of a
Time-Space Priority (TSP)queuing strategy applied to the Node B MAC-hs buffer
allocated to an end user with concurrent real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT)
flows during a multi-flow session. The experimental multiflow scenario is a
packet voice call with concurrent TCP-based file download to the same user.
Results show that with the proposed enhancements to the TSP-based RAN buffer
management, end-to-end QoS performance gains accrue to the NRT flow without
compromising RT flow QoS of the same end user session.

The underlying assumption is that the magnitude of wave propagation is small
with respect to the length scale of the structure under consideration, albeit
large enough to elicit the effects of finite-deformation. We demonstrate that
the interplay of dispersion, nonlinearity and modal complexity involved in the
generation and propagation of higher harmonics gives rise to secondary wave
packets that feature multiple characteristics, one of which conforms to the
dispersion relation of the corresponding linear structure. This provides an
opportunity to engineer desired wave characteristics through a geometric and
topological design of the unit cell, and results in the ability to activate
complementary functionalities, typical of high frequency regimes, while
operating at low frequencies of excitation - an effect seldom observed in
linear periodic structures. The ability to design adaptive switches is
demonstrated here using lattice configurations whose response is characterized
by geometric and/or material nonlinearities.

near zone is far from the two black holes, and described by the post-Newtonian
metric; and finally the wave (far) zone, where retardation effects need to be
taken into account, is well modeled by the post-Minkowskian metric. These
individual spacetimes are then stitched together using asymptotic matching
techniques to obtain a global solution that approximately satisfies the
Einstein field equations. Precession effects are introduced by rotating the
black hole spin direction according to the precessing equations of motion, in a
way that is consistent with the global spacetime construction.

the temperature dependence of bulk and shear viscosities relative to thermal

phase-transition and in the critical temperature with increasing magnetic
field. As the magnetic field strength increases, a peak appears at the critical
temperature ($T_c$). This can be understood from the small drop on the thermal
entropy at $T_c$, which can be interpreted due to instability in the
hydrodynamic flow of the quark-gluon plasma and soft statistical hadronization.

with expected fast insert and lookup operations. This data structure is used
for applications processing graphs or many-to-many relations as applied in
static analysis of object-oriented systems. When processing such big data sets
the memory overhead of the data structure encoding itself is a memory usage
bottleneck. Motivated by reuse and type-safety, libraries for Java, Scala and
Clojure typically implement immutable multi-maps by nesting sets as the values
with the keys of a trie map. Like this, based on our measurements the expected
byte overhead for a sparse multi-map per stored entry adds up to around 65B,
which renders it unfeasible to compute with effectively on the JVM.
  In this paper we propose a general framework for Hash-Array Mapped Tries on
the JVM which can store type-heterogeneous keys and values: a Heterogeneous
Hash-Array Mapped Trie (HHAMT). Among other applications, this allows for a
highly efficient multi-map encoding by (a) not reserving space for empty value
sets and (b) inlining the values of singleton sets while maintaining a (c)
type-safe API.
  We detail the necessary encoding and optimizations to mitigate the overhead
of storing and retrieving heterogeneous data in a hash-trie. Furthermore, we
evaluate HHAMT specifically for the application to multi-maps, comparing them
to state-of-the-art encodings of multi-maps in Java, Scala and Clojure. We
isolate key differences using microbenchmarks and validate the resulting
conclusions on a real world case in static analysis. The new encoding brings
the per key-value storage overhead down to 30B: a 2x improvement. With
additional inlining of primitive values it reaches a 4x improvement.

notion of an Euler tour in a graph. A flag-traversing tour of a hypergraph
corresponds to an Euler tour of its incidence graph, hence complete
characterization of hypergraphs with an Euler tour follows from Euler's
Theorem. An Euler tour is a closed walk that traverses each edge of the
hypergraph exactly once; and an Euler family is a family of closed walks that
cannot be concatenated and that jointly traverse each edge of the hypergraph
exactly once. Lonc and Naroski have shown that the problem of existence of an
Euler tour is NP-complete even on a very restricted subclass of 3-uniform
hypergraphs, while we show that the problem of existence of an Euler family is
polynomial on the class of all hypergraphs.
  Furthermore, we examine the necessary conditions for a hypergraph to admit an
Euler family (Euler tour, respectively); we show that while these necessary
conditions are sufficient for connected graphs, they are not sufficient for
general hypergraphs. On the other hand, we exhibit a new class of hypergraphs
for which these necessary conditions are also sufficient, extending a result by
Lonc and Naroski. We give a partial characterization of hypergraphs with an
Euler family (Euler tour, respectively) in terms of the intersection graph of
the hypergraph, and a complete (but not easy to verify) characterization in
terms of the incidence graph. For hypergraphs with an Euler family, we give a
complete verifiable characterization using a theorem of Lov\'{a}sz, and then
show that every 3-uniform hypergraph without cut edges admits an Euler family.
Finally, we show that a hypergraph admits an Euler family if and only if it can
be decomposed into cycles, and exhibit a relationship between 2-factors in a
hypergraph and eulerian properties of its dual.

compare four different approaches to utilizing the multiple labels: majority

the close-in tertiary is estimated to be $M_3 = 1.34M_\odot$. The period
variations of the binary system is investigated for the first time. According
to the observed-calculated ($O$-$C$) curve analysis, a continuous period
increase at a rate of $dP/dt=4.88\times{10^{-7}}day\cdot year^{-1}$ is
determined. It may be just a part of a cyclic period change, or the
combinational period change of a parabolic variation and a cyclic one. More
times of minimum light are needed to confirm this. The presence of the tertiary

decades have enabled simulations of sediment transport processes with
unprecedented fidelities. The Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element
Method (CFD--DEM) is one of the high-fidelity approaches, where the motions of
and collisions among the sediment grains as well as their interactions with
surrounding fluids are resolved. In most DEM solvers the particles are modeled
as soft spheres due to computational efficiency and implementation complexity
considerations, although natural sediments are usually mixture of non-spherical
particles. Previous attempts to extend sphere-based DEM to treat irregular
particles neglected fluid-induced torques on particles, and the method lacked
flexibility to handle sediments with an arbitrary mixture of particle shapes.
In this contribution we proposed a simple, efficient approach to represent
common sediment grain shapes with bonded spheres, where the fluid forces are
computed and applied on each sphere. The proposed approach overcomes the
aforementioned limitations of existing methods and has improved efficiency and
flexibility over existing approaches. We use numerical simulations to
demonstrate the merits and capability of the proposed method in predicting the
falling characteristics, terminal velocity, threshold of incipient motion, and
transport rate of natural sediments. The simulations show that the proposed
method is a promising approach for faithful representation of natural sediment,
which leads to accurate simulations of their transport dynamics. The proposed
method also opens the possibility for first-principle-based simulations of the
flocculation and sedimentation dynamics of cohesive sediments. Elucidation of
these physical mechanisms can provide much needed improvement on the prediction
capability and physical understanding of muddy coast dynamics.

interface between an organic semiconductor and an electrode modified with a
disordered monolayer (DM) is studied by using various benzenethiol derivatives
as DM molecules. The switching behavior is induced by a structural change in
the DM molecules, and is manifested as a reversible inversion of the polarity
of DM-modified Au electrode/rubrene/DM-modified Au electrode diodes. The
switching direction is found to be dominantly determined by the push-back
effect of the thiol bonding group, while the terminal group modulates the
switching strength. A device with 1,2-benzenedithiol DMs exhibited the highest
switching ratios of 20, 100, and 1000 for the switching voltages of 3, 5, and 7
V, respectively. A variation in the tilt angle of benzenethiol DMs owing to the
application of 7 V is estimated to be smaller than 23.6 degrees by model
calculations. This study offers an understanding for obtaining highly stable
operations of organic electronic devices, especially with molecular
modification layers.

models with applications ranging from dynamical texture recognition to video
segmentation to name a few. In this paper, we propose to represent LDSs with
infinite-dimensional subspaces and derive an analytic solution to obtain stable
LDSs. We then devise efficient algorithms to perform sparse coding and
dictionary learning on the space of infinite-dimensional subspaces. In
particular, two solutions are developed to sparsely encode an LDS. In the first
method, we map the subspaces into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and
achieve our goal through kernel sparse coding. As for the second solution, we
propose to embed the infinite-dimensional subspaces into the space of symmetric
matrices and formulate the sparse coding accordingly in the induced space. For
dictionary learning, we encode time-series by introducing a novel concept,
namely the two-fold LDSs. We then make use of the two-fold LDSs to derive an
analytical form for updating atoms of an LDS dictionary, i.e., each atom is an
LDS itself. Compared to several baselines and state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed methods yield higher accuracies in various classification tasks
including video classification and tactile recognition.

transition-metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are
promising for ultimately scaled transistors beyond Si. Although the shortening
of the semiconductor channel is widely studied, the narrowing of the channel,
which should also be important for scaling down the transistor, has been
examined to a lesser degree thus far. In this study, the impact of narrowing on
mechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes was investigated according to the
channel-width-dependent Schottky barrier heights at Cr/Au contacts. Narrower
channels were found to possess a higher Schottky barrier height, which is
ascribed to the edge-induced band bending in MoS2. The higher barrier heights
degrade the transistor performance as a higher electrode-contact resistance.
Theoretical analyses based on Poisson's equation showed that the edge-induced
effect can be alleviated by a high dopant impurity concentration, but this
strategy should be limited to channel widths of roughly 0.7 micrometers because
of the impurity-induced charge-carrier mobility degradation. Therefore, proper
termination of the dangling bonds at the edges should be necessary for
aggressive scaling with layered semiconductors.

frequency filtering (via a RC band-pass filter) and positive feedback (via an
Op-Amp). In the last few years, such oscillators have started to be utilized in
synchronization studies. We first show that the Wien-bridge circuit equations
can be cast in the form of a coupled pair of Duffing - Van der Pol equations.
Subsequently, by applying the method of multiple time scales, we derive the
differential equations that govern the slow evolution of the oscillator phases
and amplitudes. These equations are directly reminiscent of the
Kuramoto-Sakaguchi type models for the study of synchronization. We analyze the
resulting system in terms of existence and stability of various coupled
oscillator solutions and explain on that basis how their synchronization
emerges. The phase-amplitude equations are also compared numerically to the
original circuit equations, and good agreement is found. Finally, we report on
experimental measurements on two coupled Wien-bridge oscillators and relate the

inertial fusion (HIF), including the heavy ion beam (HIB) transport in a fusion

the reactor gas backflow to the beam lines, and a HIB fusion reactor design.
The HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in
inertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver
efficiency of ~30-40%, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of
materials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is
relatively low, that would be ~50 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with a
standard energy output of 1GW of electricity. In a fusion reactor the HIB
charge neutralization is needed for a ballistic HIB transport. Multiple
mechanical shutters would be installed at each HIB port at the reactor wall to
stop the blast waves and the chamber gas backflow, so that the accelerator
final elements would be protected from the reactor gas contaminant. The
essential fusion reactor components are discussed in this paper.

non-uniformity, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) growth, etc. In this
paper we propose a new control method to reduce the implosion non-uniformity;
the oscillating implosion acceleration dg(t) is created by pulsating and
dephasing heavy ion beams (HIBs) in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). The dg(t)
would reduce the RTI growth effectively. The original concept of the non-
uniformity control in inertial fusion was proposed in (Kawata, et al., 1993).
In this paper it was found that the pulsating and dephasing HIBs illumination
provide successfully the controlled dg(t) and that dg(t) induced by the
pulsating HIBs reduces well the implosion non-uniformity. Consequently the
pulsating HIBs improve a pellet gain remarkably in HIF.

exploratory nature and its usefulness as a preprocessing step for other data
mining techniques. This article develops two novel clustering algorithms for
time series data that are extensions of a crisp c-shapes algorithm. The two new
algorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes
plus (FCS+) replaces the inner product norm in the FCM model with a shape-based
distance function. Fuzzy c-Shapes double plus (FCS++) uses the shape-based
distance, and also replaces the FCM cluster centers with shape-extracted
prototypes. Numerical experiments on 48 real time series data sets show that
the two new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art shape-based clustering
algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Four external cluster validity
indices (the Rand index, Adjusted Rand Index, Variation of Information, and
Normalized Mutual Information) are used to match candidate partitions generated
by each of the studied algorithms. All four indices agree that for these finite
waveform data sets, FCS++ gives a small improvement over FCS+, and in turn,
FCS+ is better than the original crisp c-shapes method. Finally, we apply two
tests of statistical significance to the three algorithms. The Wilcoxon and
Friedman statistics both rank the three algorithms in exactly the same way as
the four cluster validity indices.

irradiation takes place during the LMXB evolution. In this work, we investigate
the effect of donor evaporation on the secular evolution of LMXBs, considering
different evaporation efficiencies and related angular momentum loss. We find
that for widening LMXBs, the donor star leaves a less massive white dwarf than
without evaporation; for contracting systems, evaporation can speed up the
evolution, resulting in dynamically unstable mass transfer and possibly the
formation of isolated MSPs.

  meta-materials",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The elastic wave propagation is investigated in the beam lattice material
characterized by a square periodic cell with anti-tetrachiral microstructure.
With reference to the Floquet-Bloch spectrum, focus is made on the band
structure enrichments and modifications which can be achieved by equipping the
cellular microstructure with tunable local resonators. By virtue of its
composite mechanical nature, the so-built inertial meta-material gains enhanced
capacities of passive frequency-band filtering. Indeed the number, placement
and properties of the inertial resonators can be designed to open, shift and
enlarge the band gaps between one or more pairs of consecutive branches in the
frequency spectrum. In order to improve the meta-material performance, a
nonlinear optimization problem is formulated. The maximum of the largest band
gap amplitudes in the low-frequency range is selected as suited objective
function. Proper inequality constraints are introduced to restrict the optimal
solutions within a compact set of mechanical and geometric parameters,
including only physically realistic properties of both the lattice and
resonators. The optimization problems related to full and partial band gaps are
solved independently, by means of a globally convergent version of the
numerical method of moving asymptotes, combined with a quasi-Monte Carlo
multi-start technique. The optimal solutions are discussed and compared from
the qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, bringing to light the limits and
potential of the meta-material performance. The clearest trends emerging from
the numerical analyses are pointed out and interpreted from the physical
viewpoint. Finally, some specific recommendations about the microstructural
design of the meta-material are synthesized.

such that the user clustering (i.e., grouping users into a single cluster or
multiple clusters) and power allocations in NOMA cluster(s) can be optimized
under transmission power constraints, minimum rate requirements of the users,
and SIC constraints. Due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated mixed
integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, we solve the problem in two
steps, i.e., by first grouping users into clusters and then optimizing their
respective power allocations. In particular, we propose a low-complexity
sub-optimal user grouping scheme. The proposed scheme exploits the channel gain
differences among users in a NOMA cluster and group them into a single cluster

a given set of NOMA clusters, we then derive the optimal power allocation
policy that maximizes the sum throughput per NOMA cluster and in turn maximizes
the overall system throughput. Using KKT optimality conditions, closed-form

We obtained Herschel/PACS imaging and spectroscopic observations of the
nebula surrounding the candidate LBV HD168625. By combining these data with
optical spectra of the star, we want to constrain the abundances in the nebula
and in the star and compare them to trace back its evolution.
  Methods. We use CMFGEN to determine the fundamental parameters and the CNO
abundances of the central star whilst the abundances of the nebula are derived
from the emission lines present in the Herschel/PACS spectrum.
  Result. The FIR images show a nebula composed of an elliptical ring/torus of
ejecta with a ESE-WNW axis and of a second perpendicular bipolar structure
composed of empty caps/rings. We detect equatorial shells composed of dust and
ionized material with different sizes when observed at different wavelengths,
and bipolar caps more of less separated from the central star in H$\alpha$ and
mid-IR images. This complex global structure seems to show 2 different
inclinations: 40{\deg} for the equatorial torus and 60{\deg} for the bipolar
ejections. From the Herschel/PACS spectrum, we determine nebular abundances of
$\mathrm{N/H} = 4.1 \pm 0.8 \times~10^{-4}$ and $\mathrm{C/H} \sim
1.6_{-0.35}^{+1.16} \times~10^{-4}$, as well as a mass of ionized gas of
$0.17\pm 0.04$M$_{\odot}$ and a neutral hydrogen mass of about $1.0\pm
0.3$M$_{\odot}$ which dominates. Analysis of the central star reveals Teff =
14000K, log g = 1.74 and log (L/L$_{\odot}$) = 5.58. We derive stellar
abundances of about $\mathrm{N/H} = 5.0 \pm 1.5 \times~10^{-4}$, $\mathrm{C/H}
= 1.4 \pm 0.5 \times~10^{-4}$ and $\mathrm{O/H} = 3.5 \pm 1.0\times~10^{-4}$.
All these measurements taken together are compatible with the evolutionary
tracks of a star with an initial mass between $28$ and $33$M$_{\odot}$ and with
a crit. rotational rate between 0.3 and 0.4 that has lost its material during
or just after the BSG phase.

to solve by direct numerical optimisation, but nevertheless have significant
amounts of relevant domain-specific knowledge. The category of heuristic search
techniques known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) seek to
incrementally sample from probability distributions in which optimal (or
near-optimal) solutions have increasingly higher probabilities. Can we use
domain knowledge to assist the estimation of these distributions? To answer
this in the affirmative, we need: (a)a general-purpose technique for the
incorporation of domain knowledge when constructing models for optimal values;
and (b)a way of using these models to generate new data samples. Here we
investigate a combination of the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for
(a), and standard logic-programming machinery to generate new samples for (b).
Specifically, on each iteration of distribution estimation, an ILP engine is
used to construct a model for good solutions. The resulting theory is then used
to guide the generation of new data instances, which are now restricted to
those derivable using the ILP model in conjunction with the background
knowledge). We demonstrate the approach on two optimisation problems
(predicting optimal depth-of-win for the KRK endgame, and job-shop scheduling).
Our results are promising: (a)On each iteration of distribution estimation,
samples obtained with an ILP theory have a substantially greater proportion of
good solutions than samples without a theory; and (b)On termination of
distribution estimation, samples obtained with an ILP theory contain more
near-optimal samples than samples without a theory. Taken together, these
results suggest that the use of ILP-constructed theories could be a useful
technique for incorporating complex domain-knowledge into estimation
distribution procedures.

For a large number of random potential configurations we have found only two
different conductivity scenarios. Both scenarios appear independently of
whether the disorder does or does not create the internode scattering. In
particular we do not confirm the conjecture that the internode scattering tends
to Anderson localization.

inhomogeneous phases at high density and low temperature. These phases are
characterized by a spatially dependent condensate or order parameter. A proper
calculation requires that one takes the vacuum fluctuations of the model into
account. These fluctuations are ultraviolet divergent and must be regularized.
We discuss different consistent ways of regularizing and renormalizing quantum
fluctuations, focusing on a symmetric energy cutoff scheme and dimensional
regularization. We apply these techniques calculating the vacuum energy in the
NJL model in 1+1 dimensions in the large-$N_c$ limit and the 3+1 dimensional

subjective and can be debatable at times. In this paper, we propose ConfAssist,
a novel assisting framework for conference categorization that aims to address
the limitations in the existing systems and portals for venue classification.
We start with the hypothesis that top-tier conferences are much more stable
than other conferences and the inherent dynamics of these groups differs to a
very large extent. We identify various features related to the stability of
conferences that might help us separate a top-tier conference from the rest of
the lot. While there are many clear cases where expert agreement can be almost
immediately achieved as to whether a conference is a top-tier or not, there are
equally many cases that can result in a conflict even among the experts.
ConfAssist tries to serve as an aid in such cases by increasing the confidence
of the experts in their decision. An analysis of 110 conferences from 22
sub-fields of computer science clearly favors our hypothesis as the top-tier
conferences are found to exhibit much less fluctuations in the stability
related features than the non top-tier ones. We evaluate our hypothesis using
systems based on conference categorization. For the evaluation, we conducted
human judgment survey with 28 domain experts. The results are impressive with
85.18% classification accuracy. We also compare the dynamics of the newly
started conferences with the older conferences to identify the initial signals
of popularity. The system is applicable to any conference with atleast 5 years
of publication history.

CXOM51 J132939.5$+$471244 (ULX-2). Three eclipses were detected for ULX-1, two
for ULX-2. The presence of eclipses puts strong constraints on the viewing
angle, suggesting that both ULXs are seen almost edge-on and are certainly not
beamed towards us. Despite the similar viewing angles and luminosities ($L_{\rm
X} \approx 2 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3$-$8$ keV band for both
sources), their X-ray properties are different. ULX-1 has a soft spectrum, well
fitted by Comptonization emission from a medium with electron temperature $kT_e
\approx 1$ keV. ULX-2 is harder, well fitted by a slim disk with $kT_{\rm in}
\approx 1.5$-$1.8$ keV and normalization consistent with a $\sim 10 M_{\odot}$
black hole. ULX-1 has a significant contribution from multi-temperature thermal
plasma emission ($L_{\rm X,mekal} \approx 2 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$);
about $10$% of this emission remains visible during the eclipses, proving that
the emitting gas comes from a region slightly more extended than the size of
the donor star. From the sequence and duration of the Chandra observations in
and out of eclipse, we constrain the binary period of ULX-1 to be either
$\approx 6.3$ days, or $\approx 12.5-13$ days. If the donor star fills its
Roche lobe (a plausible assumption for ULXs), both cases require an evolved
donor; most likely a blue supergiant, given the young age of the stellar

random arrivals and departures of users after a finite service duration, with
the service rates and distribution of radio conditions outfitted from the first

coupled due to the mutual interferences generated by each cell to the other. We
derive several performance metrics such as the mean flow throughput and the
gain, if any, generated from deploying small cells to manage traffic hotspots.
Our results show that in case the hotspot is near the macro BS (Base Station),
even a perfect positioning of the small cell will not yield improved
performance due to the high interference experienced at macro and small cell
users. However, in case the hotspot is located far enough from the macro BS,
performing errors in small cell positioning is tolerated (since related results
show positive gains) and it is still beneficial in offloading traffic from the

important factors such as the users' arrival intensity, the capacity of the

objectives, such as global optimization(estimating the global maximum or
maximizer(s) of a function),reliability analysis (estimating a probability of
failure) or theestimation of level sets and excursion sets. In this paper, we
studythe consistency of an important class of sequential designs, known
asstepwise uncertainty reduction (SUR) strategies. Our approach relieson the
key observation that the sequence of residual uncertaintymeasures, in SUR
strategies, is generally a supermartingale withrespect to the filtration
generated by the observations. Thisobservation enables us to establish generic
consistency results for abroad class of SUR strategies. The consistency of
several popularsequential design strategies is then obtained by means of this
generalresult. Notably, we establish the consistency of two SUR
strategiesproposed by Bect, Ginsbourger, Li, Picheny and Vazquez (Stat.
Comp.,2012)---to the best of our knowledge, these are the first proofs
ofconsistency for GP-based sequential design algorithms dedicated to
theestimation of excursion sets and their measure. We also establish anew, more
general proof of consistency for the expected improvementalgorithm for global
optimization which, unlike previous results inthe literature, applies to any GP
with continuous sample paths.

solution for the regular magnetic field of an axisymmetric thin disc in the
saturated state. This solution is constructed by combining two well-known types
of local galactic dynamo solution, parameterized by the disc radius. Namely,
the critical (zero growth) solution obtained by treating the dynamo equation as
a perturbed diffusion equation is normalized using a non-linear solution that
makes use of the `no-$z$' approximation and the dynamical $\alpha$-quenching
non-linearity. This overall solution is found to be reasonably accurate when
compared with detailed numerical solutions. It is thus potentially useful as a
tool for predicting observational signatures of magnetic fields of galaxies. In
particular, such solutions could be painted onto galaxies in cosmological
simulations to enable the construction of synthetic polarized synchrotron and
Faraday rotation measure (RM) datasets. Further, we explore the properties of
our numerical solutions, and their dependence on certain parameter values. We
illustrate and assess the degree to which numerical solutions based on various
levels of approximation, common in the dynamo literature, agree with one

the Unified Model, about 60% of them show no sign or very low level of X-ray
obscuration. After subtraction of contaminants to the sample, that is
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 and Compton-thick AGN, the fraction of unobscured Sy2
drops to 47%. For these sources, we were able to rule out dust reddening and
variability for most of them as an explanation of the absence of optical broad
emission-lines. The main explanations remaining are the dilution of weak/very
broad emission-lines by the host galaxy and the intrinsic absence of the
broad-line region (BLR) due to low accretion rates (i.e. True Sy2). However,
the number of True Sy2 strongly depends on the method used to verify the
intrinsic lack of broad lines. Indeed using the optical continuum luminosity to
predict the BLR properties gives a much larger fraction of True Sy2 (about 90\%
of the unobscured Sy2 sample) than the use of the X-ray 2 keV luminosity (about
20%). Nevertheless the number of AGN we securely detected as True Sy2 is at
least three times larger that the previously confirmed number of True Sy2.

tracking. Compared to detection, tracking has both additional challenges and
opportunities. Arguably the most important aspect in this domain is updating a
tracker's models as tracking progresses, also known as incremental (face)
tracking. While this should result in more accurate localisation, how to do
this online and in real time without causing a tracker to drift is still an
important open research question. We address this question in the cascaded
regression framework, the state-of-the-art approach for facial landmark
localisation. Because incremental learning for cascaded regression is costly,
we propose a much more efficient yet equally accurate alternative using
continuous regression. More specifically, we first propose cascaded continuous
regression (CCR) and show its accuracy is equivalent to the Supervised Descent
Method. We then derive the incremental learning updates for CCR (iCCR) and show
that it is an order of magnitude faster than standard incremental learning for
cascaded regression, bringing the time required for the update from seconds
down to a fraction of a second, thus enabling real-time tracking. Finally, we
evaluate iCCR and show the importance of incremental learning in achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Code for our iCCR is available from

made possible by asteroseismology. Throughout the course of the Kepler mission,
asteroseismology has also played an important role in the characterization of
exoplanet-host stars and their planetary systems. The upcoming NASA Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be performing a near all-sky survey for
planets that transit bright nearby stars. In addition, its excellent
photometric precision, combined with its fine time sampling and long intervals
of uninterrupted observations, will enable asteroseismology of solar-type and
red-giant stars. Here we develop a simple test to estimate the detectability of
solar-like oscillations in TESS photometry of any given star. Based on an
all-sky stellar and planetary synthetic population, we go on to predict the
asteroseismic yield of the TESS mission, placing emphasis on the yield of
exoplanet-host stars for which we expect to detect solar-like oscillations.
This is done for both the target stars (observed at a 2-min cadence) and the
full-frame-image stars (observed at a 30-min cadence). A similar exercise is
also conducted based on a compilation of known host stars. We predict that TESS
will detect solar-like oscillations in a few dozen target hosts (mainly
subgiant stars but also in a smaller number of F dwarfs), in up to 200
low-luminosity red-giant hosts, and in over 100 solar-type and red-giant known

hysteretic phenomena in a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) allowing for
the existence of the external dipoles on graphene free surface and the
localized states at the graphene-surface interface. We demonstrated that the
absorbed dipole molecules (e.g. dissociated or highly polarized water
molecules) can cause hysteretic form of carrier concentration as a function of
gate voltage and corresponding dependence of graphene conductivity in GFET on
the substrate of different types, including the most common SiO2 and
ferroelectric ones. It was shown that the increase of the gate voltage sweeping
rate leads to the complete vanishing of hysteresis for GFET on SiO2 substrate,
as well as for GFET on ferroelectric substrate for applied electric fields E
less than the critical value Ec. For E>Ec the crossover from the hysteresis to
antihysteresis takes place. These results well correlate with the available
experimental data up to the quantitative agreement. Proposed model takes into
consideration the carriers trapping from the graphene channel by the interface
states and describes the antihysteresis in GFET on PZT substrate well enough.
Obtained results clarify the fundamental principles of GFET operation as well
as can be directly applied to describe the basic characteristics of advanced
nonvolatile ultra-fast memory devices using GFET on versatile substrates.

anti-reflection (AR) coatings. But at optical wavelengths the QE is well

estimating a network's modules make it difficult to assess the influence of
organizational principles such as wiring cost reduction on the detected
modules. Here, we present a modification of an existing module detection
algorithm that allows us to focus on connections that are unexpected under a
cost-reduction wiring rule and to identify modules from among these
connections. We apply this technique to anatomical brain networks and show that
the modules we detect differ from those detected using the standard technique.
We demonstrate that these novel modules are spatially distributed, exhibit
unique functional fingerprints, and overlap considerably with rich clubs,
giving rise to an alternative and complementary interpretation of the
functional roles of specific brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate that, using
the modified module detection approach, we can detect modules in a

resolved in a twisted-shaped feature composed by two arc-like features and a
bow shock-like structure seen mainly in the Ks-band, which strongly suggests
the presence of a precessing jet. An analysis of proper motions based on our
Gemini observations and UKIDSS data gives additional support to the precession

related to a precessing jet up to date. The analysis of the observed
near-infrared lines shows that the H2 is collisionally excited, and the
spatially coincidence of the [FeII] and H2 emissions in the closer arc-like

field, the Galer-kin finite element method (GFEM) is generally employed. The
inherent instability of GFEM is very often addressed by employing Streamline
upwinding/Petrov-Galerkin (SU/PG) scheme. However, the SU/PG solution is known
to suffer from distortion at the boundary transverse to the velocity and the
remedial measures suggested in fluid dynamics literature are computationally
demanding. Therefore, simple alternative schemes are essential. In an earlier
effort, instead of conventional finite-difference based approach, the numerical
instability was analyzed using the Z-transform. By employing the concept of
pole-zero cancellation, stability of the numerical solution was achieved by a
simple restatement of the input magnetic flux in terms of associated vector
potential. This approach, however, is restricted for input fields, which vary
only along the direction of the velocity. To overcome this, the present work
proposes a novel approach in which the input field is restated as a weighted
elemental average. The stability of the proposed scheme is proven analytically
for both 1D and 2D cases. The error bound for the small oscillations remnant at
intermittent Peclet numbers is also deduced. Using suitable numerical
simulations, all the theoretical deductions are verified.

different temperatures with no internal heat generation and contacts at the
same temperature with internal heat generation are considered. Fourier's Law
results are compared to finite volume method solutions of the phonon Boltzmann
equation in the gray approximation. When the boundary conditions are properly
specified, results obtained using Fourier's Law without modifying the bulk
thermal conductivity are in essentially exact quantitative agreement with the
phonon Boltzmann equation in the ballistic and diffusive limits. The errors
between these two limits are examined in this paper. For the four cases
examined, the error in the apparent thermal conductivity as deduced from a
correct application of Fourier's Law is less than 6%. We also find that the
Fourier's Law results presented here are nearly identical to those obtained
from a widely-used ballistic-diffusive approach, but analytically much simpler.
Although limited to steady-state conditions with spatial variations in one
dimension and to a gray model of phonon transport, the results show that
Fourier's Law can be used for linear transport from the diffusive to the
ballistic limit. The results also contribute to an understanding of how heat
transport at the nanoscale can be understood in terms of the conceptual
framework that has been established for electron transport at the nanoscale.

the mechanical response of composite samples, giving rise to smaller extension

that the transverse momentum of the hardest particle or jet plays a key role in

during biochemical and geochemical precipitation of dissolved Si, where the
precipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes relative to the

isotope fractionation has been observed from high-temperature igneous
processes. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of
crustal material within OIB mantle source regions that experienced relatively
low-temperature surface processes in a manner similar to other stable isotope
systems, such as oxygen. Characterizing the isotopic composition of the mantle
is also of central importance to the use of the Si isotope system as a basis

some small systematic variations are present; specifically, most HIMU-type

shown that in quantum many-body systems at finite temperature, two-point

-- and that generically quantum correlations decay exponentially at finite
temperature, with a characteristic, temperature-dependent quantum coherence
length. The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum
many-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation
which affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct
description of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice
boson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of
quantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub
\emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized
to a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to
cluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces
a family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the
quantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to
standard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is

uniqueness is lost again. However, we show that all dipole directions that

certain polynomial which can be computed from the given potential. We provide
examples of non-uniqueness of the dipole direction and examples on how to find
admissible candidates for the dipole direction under the spatial localization

temperature and polarization data from the Planck mission, in combination with
low-redshift measurements such as the baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia
supernovae and the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). Given effects of massive
neutrinos on large-scale structure, we further include weak lensing, redshift
space distortion, Sunyaev--Zeldovich cluster counts and Planck lensing data. We
show that, though the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is still consistent with
the current data, a phantom dark energy ($w<-1$) or an early phantom dark
energy (i.e. quintom evolving from $w<-1$ to $w>-1$) is slightly more favoured
by current observations, which leads to the fact that in both $w$CDM and
$w_0w_a$CDM models we obtain a larger upper limit of $\sum m_\nu$. We also show
that in the three dark energy models, the constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ are in
good accordance with each other, all in favour of the standard value 3.046,
which indicates that the dark energy parameters almost have no impact on
constraining $N_{\rm eff}$. Therefore, we conclude that the dark energy
parameters can exert a significant influence on the cosmological weighing of
neutrinos, but almost cannot affect the constraint on dark radiation.

Here we develop a powerful strategy for realizing chiral microstructures in
isotropic material by coaxial interference of a vortex beam and a plane wave,
which produces three-dimensional (3D) spiral optical fields. This coaxial
interference beams are creatively produced by designing the contrivable
holograms consisting of azimuthal phase and equiphase loaded on liquid-crystal

are achieved under illumination of the coaxial interference femtosecond laser
beams with their chirality controlled by the topological charge. Our further

is simple, stable, and easy-operation, and offers broad applications in optical

Hence, a multivalent interaction can be strong, even if the individual bonds

sensitivity of the particle-substrate interaction to external conditions,
resulting in an ultra-sensitive and highly non-linear dependence of the binding
strength on parameters such as temperature, pH or receptor concentration.
  In this chapter we focus on super-selectivity: the high sensitivity of the

cell-surface can be very sensitive (super-selective) to the concentration of
the receptors to which the multiple ligands can bind.

high central gas concentration, rendering inefficient the growth of BCGs via

inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8
TeV. The dominant multijet background expectations are obtained from low jet
multiplicity control samples. Data agree well with the standard model
background predictions, and limits are set in several benchmark models.
Colorons (axigluons) with masses between 0.6 and 0.75 (up to 1.15) TeV are

the proposed hybrid input encoded full adder based RCA is data-dependent while
its reverse latency is the least equaling the propagation delay of just one

single-input-single-output general (active or passive) quantum linear systems.
For a given input we address the following questions: (1) Which parameters can
be identified by measuring the output? (2) How can we construct a system
realization from sufficient input-output data? We show that for time-dependent
inputs, the systems which cannot be distinguished are related by symplectic
transformations acting on the space of system modes. This complements a
previous result for passive linear systems. In the regime of stationary quantum
noise input, the output is completely determined by the power spectrum. We
define the notion of global minimality for a given power spectrum, and
characterize globally minimal systems as those with a fully mixed stationary
state. We show that in the case of systems with a cascade realization, the
power spectrum completely fixes the transfer function, so the system can be
identified up to a symplectic transformation. We give a method for constructing
a globally minimal subsystem direct from the power spectrum. Restricting to
passive systems the analysis simplifies so that identifiability may be
completely understood from the eigenvalues of a particular system matrix.

utilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a
reversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified

in early-type galaxies might be different from a classical Kroupa or Chabrier
IMF, i.e. contain a larger fraction of the total mass in low-mass stars. From a
theoretical point of view, supersonic turbulence has been the subject of
interest in many analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the
characteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star forming regions,
and as a consequence with the stellar IMF. Performing two suites of smoothed
particles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with different mass resolutions, we
aim at testing the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a
dense, star forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system mass function in
different density regimes. While analytical theories predict a shift of the
peak of the CMF towards lower masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the
cloud, we observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high Mach
numbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution. For the high-density
regime we do not find any trend correlating the Mach number with the
characteristic mass of the resulting IMF, implying that the dynamics of
protostellar accretion discs and fragmentation on small scales is not strongly
affected by turbulence driven at the scale of the cloud. Furthermore, we
suggest that a significant fraction of dense cores are disrupted by turbulence
before stars can be formed in their interior through gravitational collapse.
Although this particular study has limitations in its numerical resolution, we
suggest that our results, along with those from other studies, cast doubt on
the turbulent fragmentation models on the IMF that simply map the CMF to the
IMF.

mankind, with the latter ordinarily understood to exclude state or private
appropriation of any portion of its surface. However, there are indeterminacies
in the Treaty and in space law generally over the issue of appropriation. These
indeterminacies might permit a close approximation to a property claim or some
manner of quasi-property. The recently revealed highly inhomogeneous
distribution of lunar resources changes the context of these issues. We
illustrate this altered situation by considering the Peaks of Eternal Light.
They occupy about one square kilometer of the lunar surface. We consider a
thought experiment in which a Solar telescope is placed on one of the Peaks of
Eternal Light at the lunar South pole for scientific research. Its operation
would require nondisturbance, and hence that the Peak remain unvisited by
others, effectively establishing a claim of protective exclusion and de facto
appropriation. Such a telescope would be relatively easy to emplace with todays
technology and so poses a near-term property issue on the Moon. While effective
appropriation of a Peak might proceed without raising some of the familiar
problems associated with commercial development (especially lunar mining), the
possibility of such appropriation nonetheless raises some significant issues
concerning justice and the safeguarding of scientific practice on the lunar
surface. We consider this issue from scientific, technical, ethical and policy
viewpoints.

mathematical point of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is the
problem of estimating unknown parameters in the Newton's nonlinear differential
equations from satellite tracking measurements. We prove that zero initial
values for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and not
permitted physically. The numerical integration method, as currently
implemented and used in satellite gravimetry and statistics, is groundless. We
use three different methods to derive new local solutions to the Newton's
nonlinear governing differential equations of motion with a nominal reference
orbit. Bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almost
continuously at unprecedented high accuracy, we propose the measurement-based
perturbation theory and derive global uniformly convergent solutions to the
Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of motion. Since the
solutions are global uniformly convergent, they are able to extract smallest
possible gravitational signals from modern and future satellite tracking
measurements for global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models.
By directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite motion
into the nonlinear integral equations, we reformulate the links between
