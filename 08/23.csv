  Electricity Spot Market Price","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The electricity market is threatened by supply scarcity, which may lead to
very sharp price spikes in the spot market. On the other hand, demand-side's
activities could effectively mitigate the supply scarcity and absorb most of
these shocks and therefore smooth out the price volatility. In this paper, the
positive effects of employing demand response programs on the spot market price
are investigated. A demand-price elasticity based model is used to simulate the
customer reaction function in the presence of a real time pricing. The demand
achieve by DR program is used to adjust the spot market price by using a price
regression model. SAS software is used to run the multiple linear regression
model and MATLAB is used to simulate the demand response model. The approach is
applied on one week data in summer 2014 of Connecticut in New England ISO. It
could be concluded from the results of this study that applying DR program
smooths out most of the price spikes in the electricity spot market and
considerably reduces the customers' electricity cost.

introduce natural number and integer arithmetic specified according to unary

each normal form resembles common number notation, that is, either a digit, or
a string of digits without leading zero, or the negated versions of the latter.
Integer arithmetic in binary and decimal notation is based on (postfix) digit

canonical term algebra for natural numbers. Then, for each view, we consider an
alternative DDRS based on tree constructors that yields comparable normal

coupled to a massless abelian gauge field through an axial term
$\frac{\phi}{f_\gamma} F \tilde{F}$, such as in the case of an axion. Gauge
fields in this case are known to experience tachyonic growth and therefore can
backreact on the background as an effective dissipation into radiation energy
density $\rho_R$, which which can lead to inflation without the need of a flat
potential. We analyze the system, for momenta $k$ smaller than the cutoff
$f_\gamma$, including numerically the backreaction. We consider the evolution
from a given static initial condition and explicitly show that, if $f_\gamma$
is smaller than the field excursion $\phi_0$ by about a factor of at least
${\cal O} (20)$, there is a friction effect which turns on before that the
field can fall down and which can then lead to a very long stage of inflation
with a generic potential. In addition we find superimposed oscillations, which
would get imprinted on any kind of perturbations, scalars and tensors. Such
oscillations have a period of 4-5 efolds and an amplitude which is typically
less than a few percent and decreases linearly with $f_\gamma$. We also stress
that the comoving curvature perturbation on uniform density should be sensitive
to slow-roll parameters related to $\rho_R$ rather than $\dot{\phi}^2/2$,
although we postpone a calculation of the power spectrum and of non-gaussianity
to future work and we simply define and compute suitable slow roll parameters.
Finally we stress that this scenario may be realized in the axion case, if the
coupling $1/f_\gamma$ to U(1) (photons) is much larger than the coupling
$1/f_G$ to non-abelian gauge fields (gluons), since the latter sets the range
of the potential and therefore the maximal allowed $\phi_0\sim f_G$.

  The research was conducted using archival point spread function fitting
photometry measured from images in multiple bands obtained with the Advanced
Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope. Using the path linkage
criterion, we cataloged young star groups and analyzed them from the
observation of individual stars in the galaxy NGC 300. We also built stellar
density maps from the bluest stars and applied the SExtractor code to identify
overdensities. By plotting isocontours over the density maps and comparing the
two methods, we could infer and delineate the hierarchical structure of the
blue population in the galaxy. For each region of a detected young star group,
we estimated the size and derived the radial surface density profiles for
stellar populations of different color. A statistical decontamination of field
stars was performed for each region. In this way it was possible to build the
color-magnitude diagrams and compare them with theoretical evolutionary models.
We also constrained the present-day mass function per group by estimating a
value for its slope.
  The blue population in NGC 300 shows a hierarchical behavior in which the
larger and loosely distributed structures split into more compact and denser
ones over several density levels. We created a catalog of 1147 young star
groups in six fields of the galaxy NGC 300, in which we present their
fundamental characteristics. The mean and the mode radius values obtained from
the size distribution are both 25 pc, in agreement with the value for the Local

gravity. The classical theory consists of two pairs of canonical variables plus
a scalar and diffeomorphism (first class) constraints. We consider a suitable
redefinition of the Hamiltonian constraint such that the new constraint algebra
(with structure constants) is well adapted to the Dirac quantization approach.
For it, we adopt a polymeric representation for both the geometry and the
dilaton field. On the one hand, we find a suitable invariant domain of the
scalar constraint operator, and we construct explicitly its solution space.
There, the eigenvalues of the dilaton and the metric operators cannot vanish
locally, allowing us to conclude that singular geometries are ruled out in the
quantum theory. On the other hand, the physical Hilbert space is constructed
out of them, after group averaging the previous states with the diffeomorphism
constraint. In turn, we identify the standard observable corresponding to the
mass of the black hole at the boundary, in agreement with the classical theory.
We also construct an additional observable on the bulk associated with the
square of the dilaton field, with no direct classical analog.

a way that preserves both the network's spectral as well as local structure.
This method is quite versatile in the sense that it can be used to evolve a
network's topology over any collection of the network's elements. This
evolution preserves both the eigenvector centrality of these elements as well
as the eigenvalues of the original network. Although this method is introduced
as a tool to model network growth, we show it can also be used to compare the
topology of different networks where two networks are considered similar if
their evolved topologies are the same. Because this method preserves the
spectral structure of a network, which is related to the network's dynamics, it
can also be used to study the interplay of network growth and function. We show
that if a network's dynamics is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger
version of the standard notion of stability, then the network remains
intrinsically stable as the network's topology evolves. This is of interest
since the growth of a network can have a destabilizing effect on the network's
dynamics, in general. In this sense the methods developed here can be used as a
tool for designing mechanisms of network growth that ensure a network remains
stabile as it grows.

Using the phase space analysis, we explore the cosmological consequences of a
model of MOG and find some new interesting features which are absent in
$\Lambda$CDM model. More specifically we study the possibility that if the
extra fields of this theory behave like dark energy to explain the cosmic
speedup. More interestingly, with or without cosmological constant, strongly
phantom crossing happens. Also we find that this theory in its original form
($\Lambda\neq 0$), possesses a true sequence of cosmological epochs. Albeit we
show that, surprisingly, there are two radiation dominated epochs $f_5$ and
$f_6$, two matter dominated phases $f_3$ and $f_4$, and two late time
accelerated eras $f_{12}$ and $f_{7}$. Depending on the initial conditions the
universe will realize only three of these six eras. However, the matter
dominated phases are dramatically different from the standard matter dominated
epoch. In these phases the cosmic scale factor grows as $a(t)\sim t^{0.46}$ and
$t^{0.52}$, respectively, which are slower than the standard case, i.e.
$a(t)\sim t^{2/3}$. Considering these results we discuss the cosmological
viability of MOG.

necessitating the development of efficient methods for evaluating these
rankers. Online ranker evaluation focuses on the challenge of efficiently
determining, from implicit user feedback, which ranker out of a finite set of
rankers is the best. Online ranker evaluation can be modeled by dueling ban-
dits, a mathematical model for online learning under limited feedback from
pairwise comparisons. Comparisons of pairs of rankers is performed by
interleaving their result sets and examining which documents users click on.
The dueling bandits model addresses the key issue of which pair of rankers to
compare at each iteration, thereby providing a solution to the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, methods for simultaneously
comparing more than two rankers have been developed. However, the question of
which rankers to compare at each iteration was left open. We address this
question by proposing a generalization of the dueling bandits model that uses
simultaneous comparisons of an unrestricted number of rankers. We evaluate our
algorithm on synthetic data and several standard large-scale online ranker
evaluation datasets. Our experimental results show that the algorithm yields
orders of magnitude improvement in performance compared to stateof- the-art
dueling bandit algorithms.

signatures for Android from very few samples of a malware family. The key idea
underlying our technique is to look for a maximally suspicious common subgraph
(MSCS) that is shared between all known instances of a malware family. An MSCS
describes the shared functionality between multiple Android applications in
terms of inter-component call relations and their semantic metadata (e.g.,
data-flow properties). Our approach identifies such maximally suspicious common
subgraphs by reducing the problem to maximum satisfiability. Once a semantic
signature is learned, our approach uses a combination of static analysis and a
new approximate signature matching algorithm to determine whether an Android
application matches the semantic signature characterizing a given malware
family.
  We have implemented our approach in a tool called ASTROID and show that it
has a number of advantages over state-of-the-art malware detection techniques.
First, we compare the semantic malware signatures automatically synthesized by
ASTROID with manually-written signatures used in previous work and show that
the signatures learned by ASTROID perform better in terms of accuracy as well
as precision. Second, we compare ASTROID against two state-of-the-art malware
detection tools and demonstrate its advantages in terms of interpretability and
accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ASTROID's approximate signature matching
algorithm is resistant to behavioral obfuscation and that it can be used to
detect zero-day malware. In particular, we were able to find 22 instances of
zero-day malware in Google Play that are not reported as malware by existing
tools.

mission, based on the LOFT concept originally proposed to ESAs M3 and M4 calls.
LOFT-P requires very large collecting area (>6 m^2, >10x RXTE), high time
resolution, good spectral resolution, broad-band spectral coverage (2-30 keV),
highly flexible scheduling, and an ability to detect and respond promptly to
time-critical targets of opportunity. It addresses science questions such as:
What is the equation of state of ultra dense matter? What are the effects of
strong gravity on matter spiraling into black holes? It would be optimized for
sub-millisecond timing to study phenomena at the natural timescales of neutron
star surfaces and black hole event horizons and to measure mass and spin of
black holes. These measurements are synergistic to imaging and high-resolution
spectroscopy instruments, addressing much smaller distance scales than are
possible without very long baseline X-ray interferometry, and using
complementary techniques to address the geometry and dynamics of emission
regions. A sky monitor (2-50 keV) acts as a trigger for pointed observations,
providing high duty cycle, high time resolution monitoring of the X-ray sky
with ~20 times the sensitivity of the RXTE All-Sky Monitor, enabling
multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies. A probe-class mission concept
would employ lightweight collimator technology and large-area solid-state
detectors, technologies which have been recently greatly advanced during the
ESA M3 study. Given the large community interested in LOFT (>800 supporters,
the scientific productivity of this mission is expected to be very high,
similar to or greater than RXTE (~2000 refereed publications). We describe the
results of a study, recently completed by the MSFC Advanced Concepts Office,

transport by a fluid flow is of great importance to human activities. One case
of particular interest is the transport of sand in open-channel and river
flows. In many instances, the shear stresses exerted by the fluid flow are
bounded to certain limits and some grains are entrained as bed-load: a mobile
layer which stays in contact with the fixed part of the granular bed. Under
these conditions, an initially flat granular bed may be unstable, generating
ripples and dunes such as those observed on the bed of rivers. In free-surface
water flows, dunes are bedforms that scale with the flow depth, while ripples
do not scale with it. This article presents a model for the formation of
ripples and dunes based on the proposition that ripples are primary linear
instabilities and that dunes are secondary instabilities formed from the
competition between the coalescence of ripples and free surface effects.
Although simple, the model is able to explain the growth of ripples, their
saturation (not explained in previous models) and the evolution from ripples to
dunes, presenting a complete picture for the formation of dunes.

to a highly (almost fully) polarized state above the critical magnetic field.
Various optical experiments, including polarization-resolved studies,
investigation of different excitation regimes and time-resolved measurements
corroborate this scenario. However, these measurements indicate also that the

Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy, from the William Herschel Telescope, shows
clear differential variability in the broad line fluxes with respect to the

simple point-source, point-lens microlensing model provides an excellent match
to the long-term variability seen in these objects. For both models, the

10.3/13.5 and an Einstein time-scale of 7.5/10.8 yr, respectively. In one case,

careful control of interference signals produced by the digital electronics,
and clocking of all elements in the system from a single precise
observatory-derived oscillator. A new generation of telescopes operating at
these frequency bands and designed with a vastly increased emphasis on digital
signal processing to support their detector multiplexing technology or
high-bandwidth correlators---data rates exceeding a terabyte per second---are
becoming common. The ICE system is built around a custom FPGA motherboard that
makes use of an Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA and ARM-based co-processor. The system is
specialized for specific applications through software, firmware, and custom
mezzanine daughter boards that interface to the FPGA through the
industry-standard FMC specifications. For high density applications, the
motherboards are packaged in 16-slot crates with ICE backplanes that implement
a low-cost passive full-mesh network between the motherboards in a crate, allow
high bandwidth interconnection between crates, and enable data offload to a
computer cluster. A Python-based control software library automatically detects
and operates the hardware in the array. Examples of specific telescope
applications of the ICE framework are presented, namely the
frequency-multiplexed bolometer readout systems used for the SPT and Simons

bulgeless galaxies for which detailed images reveal no evidence for strong
bars. We explore two scenarios: Newtonian dark matter models and MOdified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). By adjusting the stellar mass-to-light ratio, dark
matter models can match simultaneously both the rotation curve and
bar-stability requirements in these galaxies. To be consistent with stability
constraints, in two of these galaxies, the stellar mass-to-light ratio is a
factor of ~1.5-2 lower than the values suggested from galaxy colours. In
contrast, MOND fits to the rotation curves are poor in three galaxies, perhaps
because the gas tracer contains noncircular motions. The bar stability analysis
provides a new observational test to MOND. We find that most of the galaxies
under study require abnormally-high levels of random stellar motions to be bar
stable in MOND. In particular, for the only galaxy in the sample for which the
line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion has been measured (NGC 6503), the
observed velocity dispersion is not consistent with MOND predictions because it
is far below the required value to guarantee bar stability. Precise
measurements of mass-weighted velocity dispersions in (unbarred and bulgeless)
spiral galaxies are crucial to test the consistency of MOND.

and $\Gamma \leq \mathrm{Aut}(X)$ be a discrete group acting cocompactly. The
goal of this paper is to address the following question: When is $\Gamma$
linear? More generally, when does $\Gamma$ admit a finite-dimensional
representation with infinite image over a commutative unital ring? If $X$ is
the Bruhat--Tits building of a simple algebraic group over a local field and if
$\Gamma$ is an arithmetic lattice, then $\Gamma$ is clearly linear. We prove
that if $X$ is of type $\widetilde A_2$, then the converse holds. In
particular, cocompact lattices in exotic $\widetilde A_2$-buildings are
non-linear. As an application, we obtain the first infinite family of lattices
in exotic $\widetilde A_2$-buildings of arbitrarily large thickness, providing
also a partial answer to a question of W. Kantor from 1986. We also show that
if $X$ is Bruhat--Tits of arbitrary type, then the linearity of $\Gamma$
implies that $\Gamma$ is virtually contained in the linear part of the
automorphism group of $X$, in particular $\Gamma$ is an arithmetic lattice. The
proofs are based on the machinery of algebraic representations of ergodic
systems recently developed by U. Bader and A. Furman. The implementation of
that tool in the present context requires the geometric construction of a

group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y_L}\times U(1)_{Y_R}$
possesses an automatic, exact $Z_{2 }$ symmetry under which the fermions in the
$SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y_R}$ sector (called $R$-sector) are odd and those in the
standard model sector (called $L$-sector) are even. This symmetry, which is
different from the usual parity symmetry of the left-right symmetric models,
persists in the lepton sector even after the gauge symmetry breaks down to
$SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{\rm EM}$. This keeps the lightest right-handed neutrino
naturally stable, thereby allowing it to play the role of dark matter (DM) in
the Universe. There are several differences between the usual left-right models
and the model presented here: (i) our model can have two versions, one which
has no parity symmetry so that the couplings and masses in the $L$ and $R$
sectors are unrelated, and another which has parity symmetry so that couplings
are related; (ii) the $R$-sector fermions are chosen much heavier than the
$L$-sector ones in both scenarios; and finally (iii) both light and heavy
neutrinos are Majorana fermions with the light neutrino masses arising from a
pure type-II seesaw mechanism. We discuss the DM relic density, direct and
indirect detection prospects and associated collider signatures of the model.
Comparing with current collider and direct detection constraints, we find a
lower bound on the DM mass of order of 1 TeV. We also point out a way to relax
the DM unitarity bound in our model for much larger DM masses by an entropy
dilution mechanism. An additional feature of the model is that the DM can be
made very long lived, if desired, by allowing for weak breaking of the above
$Z_{2}$ symmetry. Our model also predicts the existence of long-lived colored
particles which could be searched for at the LHC.

galaxy. Here, we investigate the properties of the source by studying its size
and luminosity from the imaging and the luminosity and velocity width of the
Ly-$\alpha$ line from the spectrum. Our analyses suggest that the source is
most probably a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) but the
possibility of it being a compact bright galaxy (e.g., a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter
or Lyman Break Galaxy) cannot be excluded. The brighter pair of lensed images
appears point-like except in the HSC $i$-band (with a seeing $\sim0.5""$). The
extended emission in the $i$-band image could be due to the host galaxy
underneath the AGN, or alternatively, due to a highly compact lensed galaxy
(without AGN) which appears point-like in all bands except in $i$-band. We also
find that the flux ratio of the brighter pair of images is different in the
Ks-band compared to optical wavelengths. Phenomena such as differential
extinction and intrinsic variability cannot explain this chromatic variation.
While microlensing from stars in the foreground galaxy is less likely to be the
cause, it cannot be ruled out completely. If the galaxy hosts an AGN, then this
represents the highest redshift quadruply imaged AGN known to date, enabling
study of a distant LLAGN. Discovery of this unusually compact and faint source
demonstrates the potential of the HSC survey.

gradients from star-forming galaxies. We use the DEIMOS spectrograph on the

RXJ1532+3021. Based on our measured interstellar medium (ISM) properties of
star-forming galaxies out to a radius of 2.5 Mpc from the cluster centre, we
find that the galaxy metallicity decreases as a function of projected
cluster-centric distance (-0.15+/-0.08 dex/Mpc) in MACS1115+01. On the
mass-metallicity relation (MZR), star-forming galaxies in MACS1115+01 are
offset to higher metallicity (~0.2 dex) than the local SDSS galaxies at a fixed
mass range. In contrast, the MZR of RXJ1532+30 is consistent with the local
comparison sample. RXJ1532+30 exhibits a bimodal radial metallicity
distribution, with one branch showing a similar negative gradient as
MACS1115+01 (-0.14+/-0.05 dex/Mpc) and the other branch showing a positive
radial gradient. The positive gradient branch in RXJ1532+30 is likely caused by
either interloper galaxies or an in-plane merger, indicating that cluster-scale
abundance gradients probe cluster substructures and thus the dynamical state of
a cluster. Most strikingly, we discover that neither the radial metallicity
gradient nor the offset from the MZR is driven by the stellar mass. We compare
our observations with Rhapsody-G cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in
simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters and find that the simulated galaxy
cluster also exhibits a negative abundance gradient, albeit with a shallower
slope (-0.04+/-0.03 dex/Mpc). Our observations suggest that the negative radial
gradient originates from ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation processes
in the cluster environments.

trigger of gas accretion can be caused by disc material ejected into the halo
in the form of fountain clouds and by its interaction with the surrounding hot
corona. Indeed, at the disc-corona interface, the mixing between the
cold/metal-rich disc gas (T <~ 10^4 K) and the hot coronal gas (T >~ 10^6 K)
can dramatically reduce the cooling time of a portion of the corona and produce
its condensation and accretion. We studied the interaction between fountain
clouds and corona in different galactic environments through parsec-scale
hydrodynamical simulations, including the presence of thermal conduction, a key
mechanism that influences gas condensation. Our simulations showed that the
coronal gas condensation strongly depends on the galactic environment, in
particular it is less efficient for increasing virial temperature/mass of the
haloes where galaxies reside and it is fully ineffective for objects with
virial masses larger than 10^13 Msun. This result implies that the coronal gas
cools down quickly in haloes with low-intermediate virial mass (Mvir <~ 3 x
10^12 Msun) but the ability to cool the corona decreases going from late-type
to early-type disc galaxies, potentially leading to the switching off of
accretion and the quenching of star formation in massive systems.

low-mass exoplanets around mid-late M stars at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths,
where those stars are brightest and have the most Doppler information content.
A central requirement for the success of these instruments is to properly
measure the component of radial velocity (RV) variability contributed by
stellar magnetic activity and to account for it in exoplanet models of RV data.
The wavelength coverage for many of these new instruments will not include the
Ca II H&K or H-alpha lines, the most frequently used absorption-line tracers of
magnetic activity. Thus, it is necessary to define and characterize NIR
activity indicators for mid-late M stars in order to provide simultaneous
activity metrics for NIR RV data. We have used the high-cadence UVES
observations of the M5.5 dwarf Proxima Centauri from Fuhrmeister et al. (2011)
to compare the activity sensitivity of 8 NIR atomic lines to that of H-alpha.
We find that equivalent width-type measurements of the NIR K I doublet and the
Ca II NIR triplet are excellent proxies for the canonical optical tracers. The
Ca II triplet will be acquired by most of the new and upcoming NIR Doppler
spectrographs, offering a common, reliable indicator of activity.

dissipative processes that act on each atom individually and do not conserve

i) non-equilibrium systems with losses and conserved spin and ii) closed

Type Ia Supernova when their temperature and/or density reach the point where
Carbon is ignited in a runaway reaction. Observations of the Type Ia supernova
(SN) rate imply all WD binaries that merge through the emission of
gravitational radiation within a Hubble time should result in SNe, regardless
of total mass. Here we investigate the conditions under which a single WD in a
binary system might extract energy from its orbit, depositing enough energy
into a resonant mode such that it detonates before merger. We show that,
ignoring non-linear effects, in a WD binary in tidal lock at small binary
separations, the sustained tidal forcing of a low-order quadrupolar g-mode or a
harmonic of a low-order quadrupolar p-mode could in principle drive the average
temperature of Carbon nuclei in the mode over the runaway fusion threshold. If
growing mode energy is thermalized at a core/atmosphere boundary, rapid Helium
burning and inward-travelling p-waves may result in core detonation.
Thermalization at a boundary in the core can also result in detonation. If
energy can be efficiently transferred from the orbit to modes as the WD binary
passes through resonances, the WD merger timescale will be shortened by Myr-Gyr
compared to expected timescales from GW-emission alone and GW detectors will
observe deviations from predicted chirp profiles in resolved WD binaries.
Future work in this area should focus on whether tidal locking in WD binaries
is naturally driven towards low-order mode frequencies.

multiple, lower mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We simulate the effects
of forcing both eccentricity and inclination, separately and together. We
compare our results to the statistics of the observed Kepler data and examine
whether these results can be used to explain the observed excess of single
transiting planets. We cannot explain the observed excess by pumping only
inclination without driving most systems over the edge of dynamical
instability. Thus, we expect the underlying planetary population for systems
with a single transitting planet to contain an intrinsically low multiplicity
population. We can explain the Kepler statistics and occurrence rates for R< 2
Rearth planets with a perturber population consistent with that inferred from
radial velocity surveys, but require too many giant planets if we wish to
explain all planets with R < 4 Rearth. These numbers can be brought into
agreement if we posit the existence of an equivalent size population of planets
below the RV detection limit (of characteristic mass 0.1 Mjupiter). This
population would need to be dynamically hot to produce sufficiently strong
perturbations and would leave the imprint of high obliquities amongst the
surviving planets. Thus, an extensive sample of obliquities for low mass
planets can help to indicate the presence of such a population. (...) Some of
our simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the
habitable zone but have no planets interior to them -- much as in the case of
our Solar System. This suggests that such a configuration may not be altogether
rare, but may occur around a few percent of FGK stars.

(i) depending on workload characteristics, there is a turning point where

to analytically demonstrate that the type-I Weyl semimetals may undergo a
quantum phase transition to type-II Weyl semimetals in the presence of the
finite charge and magnetic disorder when non-zero tilt exist. The phase
transition occurs when the disorder renormalizes the topological mass, thereby
reducing the Fermi velocity near the Weyl cone below the tilt of the cone. We
also confirm the presence of the disorder induced phase transition in Weyl

occur out of necessity, but instead can occur many generations before there is
a selective advantage, and thus organisms follow Darwinian evolution instead of
Lamarckian. Since then, new areas of research involving microbial evolution
have spawned as a result of their experiment. Determining the mutation rate of
a cell is one such area. Probability distributions that determine the number of
mutants in a large population have been derived by D. E. Lea, C. A. Coulson,

division is dependent on the cell age, and even less so when cell division is
asymmetric, which is the case in most microbial populations. Using probability
generating function methods, we rigorously construct a probability distribution
for the cell population size given a life-span distribution for both mother and
daughter cells, and then determine its asymptotic growth rate. We use this to
construct a probability distribution for the number of mutants in a large cell
population, which can be used with likelihood methods to estimate the cell
mutation rate.

amplification against passive adversaries, where it is assumed that the

the presence of classical as well as quantum side information by a
single-message protocol based on strong extractors.
  In 2009 Dodis and Wichs devised a two-message protocol to achieve privacy
amplification against active adversaries, where the public communication
channel is no longer assumed to be authenticated, through the use of a
strengthening of strong extractors called non-malleable extractors which they
introduced. Dodis and Wichs only analyzed the case of classical side

  We consider the task of privacy amplification against active adversaries with
quantum side information. Our main result is showing that the Dodis-Wichs

non-malleable extractor, satisfies a notion of quantum-proof non-malleability
which we introduce. We show that an adaptation of a recent construction of
non-malleable extractors due to Chattopadhyay et al. is quantum proof, thereby
providing the first protocol for privacy amplification that is secure against
active quantum adversaries. Our protocol is quantitatively comparable to the
near-optimal protocols known in the classical setting.

the near-Earth environment, making it crucial to forecast flares in order to
mitigate their negative effects. The number of published approaches to flare
forecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated,
with varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different
analysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare
the results from the literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event
rates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have
long been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully
acknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on
""all clear"" forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number
of existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically
line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from MDI, with
consistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the
importance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard
verification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme.
When a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed
all others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the
parameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For
M-class flares and above, the set of methods tends towards a weakly positive
skill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating
method proving substantially better than climatological forecasts.

and quiescent ($\Delta V_{FWHM} \sim 4$ km s $^{-1}$) component; a warmer
(T$_{ex} \sim 80-100$ K), less spatially extended ($\sim 30""$), and dynamic
($\Delta V_{FWHM} \sim 8$ km s $^{-1}$) component, which is likely affected by
embedded outflows; and a kinematically distinct region (T$_{ex}$ $>$ 100 K;
V$_{LSR}$ $\sim$ 8 km s $^{-1}$), dominated by emission from species which
trace ultraviolet irradiation, likely at the surface of the cloud. We find
little evidence for the existence of a chemically distinct ""hot core""

within the \textit{Herschel} beam. We find that the chemical composition of the
gas in the cooler, quiescent component of Orion South more closely resembles
that of the quiescent ridge in Orion-KL. The gas in the warmer, dynamic

Plateau regions of Orion-KL, suggesting that higher temperatures and shocks
also have an influence on the overall chemistry of Orion South.

biological networks have a multilayer nature and can be described by multiplex

Characterizing the centrality of the nodes in a multiplex network is a
challenging task since the centrality of the node naturally depends on the
importance associated to links of a certain type. Here we propose to assign to
each node of a multiplex network a centrality called Functional Multiplex
PageRank that is a function of the weights given to every different pattern of

nodes. Since multilinks distinguish all the possible ways in which the links in
different layers can overlap, the Functional Multiplex PageRank can describe
important non-linear effects when large relevance or small relevance is
assigned to multilinks with overlap. Here we apply the Functional Page Rank to
the multiplex airport networks, to the neuronal network of the nematode
c.elegans, and to social collaboration and citation networks between
scientists. This analysis reveals important differences existing between the
most central nodes of these networks, and the correlations between their so
called ""pattern to success"".

has been proposed, where the outer precoder is implemented using traditional
limited feedback while the inner precoder is determined by the spatial
covariance matrix of the channels. In massive MIMO systems, it is difficult to
quantize the spatial covariance matrix because of its large size caused by the
huge number of antennas. In this paper, we propose a spatial spectrum based
approach for the quantization and the feedback of the spatial covariance

traditional discrete Fourier transform submatrix based precoding. Practical
issues for the application of the proposed approach are also addressed in this

reduce the overhead of downlink channel estimation and uplink feedback in FDD

low-dimensional effective channel needs to be estimated and fed back. On the
other hand, traditional channel estimations can hardly achieve the minimum
mean-square-error (MMSE) performance due to lack of the a priori knowledge of
the channels. In this paper, we design and analyze a strategy for downlink
channel estimation based on the parametric model in massive MIMO with cascaded
precoding. For a parametric model, channel frequency responses are expressed
using the path delays and the associated complex amplitudes. The path delays of
uplink channels are first estimated and quantized at the base station, then fed
forward to the user equipment (UE) through a dedicated feedforward link. In
this manner, the UE can obtain the a priori knowledge of the downlink channel
in advance since it has been demonstrated that the downlink and the uplink
channels can have identical path delays. Our analysis and simulation results
show that the proposed approach can achieve near-MMSE performance.

scenario for thick disk formation, in which the thickness of the star-forming
gas layer contracts as the stellar mass of the disk grows, we combine one-zone
chemical evolution with a simple prescription in which the scale-height of the
stellar distribution drops linearly from z_h=0.8 kpc to z_h=0.2 kpc over a
timescale t_c, remaining constant thereafter. We assume a linear-exponential
star-formation history, SFR ~ te^{-t/t_sf}. With a star-formation efficiency
timescale of 2 Gyr, an outflow mass-loading factor of 1.5, t_sf=3 Gyr, and
t_c=2.5 Gyr, the model reproduces the observed locus of inner disk stars in
[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) measured by
H15 at |z|=0-0.5 kpc, 0.5-1 kpc, and 1-2 kpc. Substantial changes to model
parameters lead to disagreement with the H15 data; for example, models with
t_c=1 Gyr or t_sf=1 Gyr fail to match the observed MDF at high-|z| and low-|z|,
respectively. The inferred scale-height evolution, with z_h(t) dropping on a
timescale t_c ~ t_sf at large lookback times, favors upside-down formation over
dynamical heating of an initially thin stellar population as the primary
mechanism regulating disk thickness. The failure of our short-t_c models
suggests that any model in which thick disk formation is a discrete event will
not reproduce the continuous dependence of the MDF on |z| found by H15. Our
scenario for the evolution of the inner disk can be tested by future
measurements of the |z|-distribution and the age-metallicity distribution at
R=3-5 kpc.

large datasets, researchers propose PKMeans, which is a parallel k-means on
MapReduce. However, the existing k-means parallelization methods including
PKMeans have many limitations. PKMeans can't finish all its iterations in one
MapReduce job, so it has to repeat cascading MapReduce jobs in a loop until
convergence. On the most popular MapReduce platform, Hadoop, every MapReduce
job introduces significant I/O overheads and extra execution time at stages of
job start-up and shuffling. Even worse, it has been proved that in the worst
case, k-means needs $2^{{\Omega}(n)}$ MapReduce jobs to converge, where n is
the number of data instances, which means huge overheads for large datasets.
Additionally, in PKMeans, at most one reducer can be assigned to and update
each centroid, so PKMeans can only make use of limited number of parallel
reducers. In this paper, we propose an improved parallel method for k-means,
IPKMeans, which has a parallel preprocessing stage using k-d tree and can
finish k-means in one single MapReduce job with much more reducers working in
parallel and lower I/O overheads than PKMeans and has a fast post-processing
stage generating the final result. In our method, both k-d tree and the new
improved parallel k-means are implemented using MapReduce and tested on Hadoop.
Our experiments show that with same dataset and initial centroids, our method
has up to 2/3 lower I/O overheads and consumes less amount of time than PKMeans
to get a very close clustering result.

There is an inherent variability in both the number of fractures formed and the
time delay before fractures form. In the regime where single fractures form, we
observe a Weibull-like distribution of delay times, consistent with a
thermally-activated process. The shape parameter is close to 1 for softer gels
(a Poisson process), and larger for stiffer gels (indicative of aging). For
single fractures, the characteristic delay time is primarily set by the
elastocapillary length of the system, calculated from the differential in
surface tension between the droplet and the substrate, rather than the elastic
modulus as for stiffer systems. For multiple fractures, all fractures appear
simultaneously and long delay times are suppressed. The delay time distribution
provides a new technique for probing the energy landscape and fracture

heating the sample from the ordered conical phase under finite field. This
difference in stabilization is surprisingly similar to the irreversibility
observed in spin glasses. The zero-field cooling results in the co-existence of
the two phases. It is further found that once one of the skyrmion-lattice

Firstly, the sufficient and necessary condition for the solvability of

on the maximum principle developed in this paper, which is compared with the
results obtained in literatures where only operator type solvability conditions
were given. The optimal controller is given in terms of a coupled Riccati
equation which is derived from the solution to forward and backward stochastic
difference equation (FBSDE). Secondly, the sufficient and necessary
stabilization conditions are explored. It is shown that, under exactly
observability assumption, the mean-field system is stabilizable in mean square
sense if and only if a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) has a unique
solution $P$ and $\bar{P}$ satisfying $P>0$ and $P+\bar{P}>0$. Furthermore,
under the exactly detectability assumption, which is a weaker assumption than
exactly observability, we show that the mean-field system is stabilizable in

$\bar{P}$ satisfying $P\geq 0$ and $P+\bar{P}\geq 0$. The key techniques
adopted in this paper are the maximum principle and the solution to the FBSDE

components. A pants decomposition of a surface is a finite collection of
unordered pairwise disjoint simple closed curves embedded in the surface that
decompose the surface into pants. In this paper we present two Morse theory
based algorithms for pants decomposition of a surface mesh. Both algorithms
operates on a choice of an appropriate Morse function on the surface. The first
algorithm uses this Morse function to identify handles that are glued
systematically to obtain a pant decomposition. The second algorithm uses the
Reeb graph of the Morse function to obtain a pant decomposition. Both
algorithms work for surfaces with or without boundaries. Our preliminary
implementation of the two algorithms shows that both algorithms run in much
less time than an existing state-of-the-art method, and the Reeb graph based
algorithm achieves the best time efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the
robustness of our algorithms against noise.

and reddening of 1072 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using
the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) III survey data. This study
brings out 308 newly parameterised clusters. In a first of its kind, the LMC
clusters are classified into groups based on richness/mass as very poor, poor,
moderate and rich clusters, similar to the classification scheme of open
clusters in the Galaxy. A major cluster formation episode is found to happen at
125 +- 25 Myr in the inner LMC. The bar region of the LMC appears prominently
in the age range 60 - 250 Myr and is found to have a relatively higher
concentration of poor and moderate clusters. The eastern and the western ends
of the bar are found to form clusters initially, which later propagates to the
central part. We demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the
distribution of clusters as a function of mass, using a movie based on the
propagation (in space and time) of cluster formation in various groups. The
importance of including the low mass clusters in the cluster formation history
is demonstrated. The catalog with parameters, classification, and cleaned and
isochrone fitted CMDs of 1072 clusters, which are available as online material,
can be further used to understand the hierarchical formation of clusters in
selected regions of the LMC.

determinations need to be as accurate as possible. We investigate the accuracy
of spectroscopic iron abundance analyses using archetypal metal-poor stars. We
perform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations based on 3D
hydrodynamic Stagger model atmospheres, and employ a new model atom that
includes new quantum-mechanical neutral hydrogen collisional rate coefficients.
With the exception of the red giant HD122563, we find that the 3D non-LTE
models achieve Fe i/Fe ii excitation and ionization balance as well as not
having any trends with equivalent width to within modelling uncertainties of
0.05 dex, all without having to invoke any microturbulent broadening; for
HD122563 we predict that the current best parallax-based surface gravity is
over-estimated by 0.5 dex. Using a 3D non-LTE analysis, we infer iron
abundances from the 3D model atmospheres that are roughly 0.1 dex higher than
corresponding abundances from 1D MARCS model atmospheres; these differences go
in the same direction as the non-LTE effects themselves. We make available
grids of departure coefficients, equivalent widths and abundance corrections,
calculated on 1D MARCS model atmospheres and horizontally- and
temporally-averaged 3D Stagger model atmospheres.

  Approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1505.02648",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault Tree (FT) is a standard failure modeling technique that has been
extensively used to predict reliability, availability and safety of many
complex engineering systems. In order to facilitate the formal analysis of FT
based analyses, a higher-order-logic formalization of FTs has been recently
proposed. However, this formalization is quite limited in terms of handling
large systems and transformation of FT models into their corresponding
Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) structures, i.e., a frequently used
transformation in reliability and availability analyses. In order to overcome
these limitations, we present a deep embedding based formalization of FTs. In
particular, the paper presents a formalization of AND, OR and NOT FT gates,
which are in turn used to formalize other commonly used FT gates, i.e., NAND,
NOR, XOR, Inhibit, Comparator and majority Voting, and the formal verification
of their failure probability expressions. For illustration purposes, we present
a formal failure analysis of a communication gateway software for the next
generation air traffic management system.

presented for systems with periodicity in one, two and three dimensions as well
as isolated molecules. The generalized Pipek--Mezey Wannier functions (PMWF)
are highly localized orbitals consistent with chemical intuition where a
distinction is maintained between {\sigma}- and {\pi}-orbitals. The PMWF method
is compared with the so-called maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF)
that are frequently used for the analysis of condensed matter calculations.
Whereas PMWFs maximize the localization criterion of Pipek and Mezey, MLWFs
maximize that of Foster and Boys and have the disadvantage of mixing {\sigma}-
and {\pi}-orbitals in many cases. The PMWF orbitals turn out to be as localized
as the MLWF orbitals as evidenced by cross-comparison of the values of the PMWF
and MLWF objective functions for the two types of orbitals. Our implementation
in the atomic simulation environment (ASE) is compatible with various
representations of the wave function, including real-space grids, plane waves
and linear combinations of atomic orbitals. The projector augmented wave
formalism for the representation of atomic core electrons is also supported.

higher dimensional field theories. The generalized J-L-D representation is
utilized to derive the t-plane analyticity property of the amplitude. The
existence of an ellipse analogous to the Lehmann ellipse is demonstrated. Thus
a fixed-t dispersion relation can be written down with finite number of
subtractions due to the temperedness of the amplitudes. The domain of
analyticity of scattering amplitude in $s$ and $t$ variables is extended by
imposing unitarity constraints. A generalized version of Martin's theorem is
derived to prove the existence of such a domain in D-dimensional field
theories. It is shown that the amplitude can be expanded in a power series in t
which converges for |t|<R; R being s-independent. The positivity properties of
absorptive amplitudes are derived to prove the $t$-plane analyticity of
amplitude. In the extended analyticity domain dispersion relations are written
with two subtractions. The bound on the total cross section is derived from LSZ
axioms without any extra ad hoc assumptions.

  Partial Monitoring Games","Appearing in NIPS 2016",,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial monitoring games are repeated games where the learner receives
feedback that might be different from adversary's move or even the reward
gained by the learner. Recently, a general model of combinatorial partial
monitoring (CPM) games was proposed \cite{lincombinatorial2014}, where the
learner's action space can be exponentially large and adversary samples its
moves from a bounded, continuous space, according to a fixed distribution. The
paper gave a confidence bound based algorithm (GCB) that achieves
$O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ distribution independent and $O(\log T)$ distribution
dependent regret bounds. The implementation of their algorithm depends on two
separate offline oracles and the distribution dependent regret additionally
requires existence of a unique optimal action for the learner. Adopting their
CPM model, our first contribution is a Phased Exploration with Greedy
Exploitation (PEGE) algorithmic framework for the problem. Different algorithms
within the framework achieve $O(T^{2/3}\sqrt{\log T})$ distribution independent
and $O(\log^2 T)$ distribution dependent regret respectively. Crucially, our
framework needs only the simpler ""argmax"" oracle from GCB and the distribution
dependent regret does not require existence of a unique optimal action. Our
second contribution is another algorithm, PEGE2, which combines gap estimation
with a PEGE algorithm, to achieve an $O(\log T)$ regret bound, matching the GCB
guarantee but removing the dependence on size of the learner's action space.
However, like GCB, PEGE2 requires access to both offline oracles and the
existence of a unique optimal action. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can
be efficiently applied to a CPM problem of practical interest: namely, online
ranking with feedback at the top.

it is well-known that harvest-then-transmit introduces uplink-downlink coupling

planning at the servo level of a mobile robot. The ability to perform, in a
provably correct manner, such a complex task at the servo level can lead to a
large increase in the speed of operation, low energy consumption and high
quality of response. Planning has been traditionally limited to the high level
controller of a robot. The guidance velocity signal from this stage is usually
converted to a control signal using what is known as an electronic speed
controller (ESC). This paper demonstrates the ability of the harmonic potential
field (HPF) approach to generate a provably correct, constrained, well behaved
trajectory and control signal for a rigid, nonholonomic robot in a stationary,
cluttered environment. It is shown that the HPF based, servo level planner can
address a large number of challenges facing planning in a realistic situation.
The suggested approach migrates the rich and provably correct properties of the
solution trajectories from an HPF planner to those of the robot. This is
achieved using a synchronizing control signal whose aim is to align the
velocity of the robot in its local coordinates, with that of the gradient of
the HPF. The link between the two is made possible by representing the robot
using what the paper terms separable form. The context-sensitive and
goal-oriented control signal used to steer the robot is demonstrated to be well
behaved and robust in the presence of actuator noise, saturation and
uncertainty in the parameters. The approach is developed, proofs of correctness
are provided and the capabilities of the scheme are demonstrated using
simulation results.

intensity selected spectra were built along 11 years of BAT survey. While the
fundamental line is not revealed, the second harmonic of the CRSF can be
clearly detected in all the spectra, at an energy varying between $\sim 53$ keV
and $\sim 58$ keV, directly correlated with the luminosity. We have further
investigated the evolution of the CRSF in time, by studying the intensity
selected spectra built along four 33-month time intervals along the survey. For
the first time we find in this source a secular variation in the CRSF energy:
independent of the source luminosity, the CRSF second harmonic energy decreases
by $\sim 0.36$ keV/year between the first and the third time interval,
corresponding to an apparent decay of the magnetic field of $\sim 3\times
10^{10}$ G/year. The intensity-cyclotron energy pattern is consistent between
the third and the last time intervals. A possible interpretation for this decay
could be the settling of an accreted mound that produces either a distortion of
the poloidal magnetic field on the polar cap or a geometrical displacement of
the line forming region. This hypothesis seems supported by the correspondance
between the rate of the line shift per unit accreted mass and the mass accreted

The nanomesh films have been successfully transferred to different substrates,

depolarization rates of the $p$-levels of ions for large number of values of
the effective principal quantum number $n^{*}$ and the Uns\""old energy $E_p$.
Then, genetic programming has been utilized to fit the available depolarization

correlation of the Yb local moments. We point out the anisotropic interaction
between the effective-spins on the nearest neighbor bonds is sufficient to
reproduce the spin-wave dispersion of the fully polarized state in the presence
of strong magnetic field normal to the triangular plane. We further evaluate
the effective-spin correlation within the mean-field spherical approximation.
We explicitly demonstrate that, the nearest-neighbor anisotropic effective-spin
interaction, originating from the strong spin-orbit coupling, enhances the
effective-spin correlation at the M points in the Brillouin zone. We identify
these results as the strong evidence for the anisotropic interaction and the
strong spin-orbit coupling in YbMgGaO$_4$.

magnetic turbulence and investigate the evolution with the heliocentric
distance and latitude. We use data from the Ulysses spacecraft measured during
two solar minima (1997-1998 and 2007-2008) and one solar maximum (1999-2001).
In particular, by modeling a multifractal spectrum, we revealed the
intermittent character of turbulence in the small-scale fluctuations of the
magnetic field embedded in the slow and fast solar wind. Generally, at small
distances from the Sun, in both the slow and fast solar wind, we observe the
high degree of multifractality (intermittency) that decreases somewhat slowly
with distance and slowly with latitude. The obtained results seem to suggest
that generally intermittency in the solar wind has a solar origin. However, the
fast and slow streams, shocks, and other nonlinear interactions can only be
considered as the drivers of the intermittent turbulence. It seems that
analysis shows that turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane evolves too slowly to
maintain the intermittency with the distance and latitude. Moreover, we confirm
that the multifractality and intermittency are at a lower level than in the
ecliptic, as well as the existence of symmetry with respect to the ecliptic
plane, suggesting that there are similar turbulent properties observed in the
two hemispheres.

underlying Boltzmann-Vlasov equation within the relaxation-time approximation

are first solved in the approximation of a fixed relaxation time, and then this

Seiberg's dual with $SU(N_F-N_c)$ dual colors), and with $N_F$ flavors of light
quarks ${\overline Q}_j, Q^i$ with the mass term in the superpotential $m_Q{\rm

additional colorless but flavored fields $\Phi^j_i$ with the large mass
parameter $\mu_{\Phi}\gg\Lambda_Q$. But now considered is the region
$N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2$ where the UV free direct $SU(N_c)$ theory is strongly
coupled at scales $\mu<\Lambda_Q$.
  The mass spectra of this direct theory in various vacua and at different
values of $\mu_{\Phi}\gg\Lambda_Q$ are calculated within the dynamical scenario
introduced by the author in [10]. This scenario assumes that quarks in such
${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories can be in two standard phases only. These are
either the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are confined or the Higgs phase.
  It is shown that due to the strong power-like RG evolution, the seemingly
heavy and dynamically irrelevant at scales $\mu<\Lambda_Q$ fields $\Phi^j_i$
can become light and relevant at lower energies, and there appear then two
additional generation of light $\Phi$-particles with masses $\mu_{2,3}^{\rm
pole}(\Phi)\ll\Lambda_Q$.
  The calculated mass spectra of this strongly coupled at $\mu<\Lambda_Q\,
SU(N_c)$ theory are compared to those of its weakly coupled at $\mu<\Lambda_Q$
Seiberg's dual $SU(N_F-N_c)$ variant and appeared to be parametrically
different. It is worth to recall that the dynamical scenario from [10] used in
this article satisfies all those tests which were used as checks of the Seiberg
hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual theories. This
parametrical difference shows, in particular, that all these tests, although
necessary, may well be insufficient.

multigrid save memory and are often significantly faster than implementations
using classical sparse matrix techniques. They are especially well suited for
hierarchical hybrid grids on polyhedral domains. In the case of constant
coefficients all fine grid node stencils in the interior of a coarse macro
element are equal. However, for non-polyhedral domains the situation changes.
Then even for the Laplace operator, the non-linear element mapping leads to
fine grid stencils that can vary from grid point to grid point. This
observation motivates a new two-scale approach that exploits a piecewise
polynomial approximation of the fine grid operator with respect to the coarse
mesh size. The low-cost evaluation of these surrogate polynomials results in an
efficient stencil assembly on-the-fly for non-polyhedral domains that can be
significantly more efficient than matrix-free techniques that are based on an
element-wise assembly. The performance analysis and additional hardware-aware
code optimizations are based on the Execution-Cache-Memory model. Several
aspects such as two-scale a priori error bounds and double discretization
techniques are presented. Weak and strong scaling results illustrate the
benefits of the new technique when used within large scale PDE solvers.

continuous-time mean-field systems (MFS). Under standard assumptions, necessary
and sufficient conditions to stabilize the mean-field systems in the mean
square sense are explored for the first time. It is shown that, under the
assumption of exact detectability (exact observability), the mean-field system
is stabilizable if and only if a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (ARE)
admits a unique positive semi-definite solution (positive definite solution),
which coincides with the classical stabilization results for standard
deterministic systems and stochastic systems.
  One of the key techniques in the paper is the obtained solution to the
forward and backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) associated with
the maximum principle for an optimal control problem. Actually, with the
analytical FBSDE solution, a necessary and sufficient solvability condition of
the optimal control, under mild conditions, is derived. Accordingly, the
stabilization condition is presented by defining an Lyaponuv functional via the
solution to the FBSDE and the optimal cost function.
  It is worth of pointing out that the presented results are different from the
previous works for stabilization and also different from the works on optimal

different time scales. Pulsatile dynamics are thought to be widespread, and
single-cell live imaging of gene expression has lead to a surge of dynamic,
possibly oscillatory, data for different gene networks. However, the regulation
of gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions
between finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness
in expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic
fluctuations and noisy oscillators. Thus, there is an acute need for an
objective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived
noisy time series is periodic. Here we present a new data analysis method that
combines mechanistic stochastic modelling with the powerful methods of
non-parametric regression with Gaussian processes. Our method can distinguish
oscillatory gene expression from random fluctuations of non-oscillatory
expression in single-cell time series, despite peak-to-peak variability in
period and amplitude of single-cell oscillations. We show that our method
outperforms the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in successfully classifying cells as
oscillatory or non-oscillatory in data simulated from a simple genetic
oscillator model and in experimental data. Analysis of bioluminescent live cell
imaging shows a significantly greater number of oscillatory cells when
luciferase is driven by a {\it Hes1} promoter (10/19), which has previously
been reported to oscillate, than the constitutive MoMuLV 5' LTR (MMLV) promoter
(0/25). The method can be applied to data from any gene network to both
quantify the proportion of oscillating cells within a population and to measure
the period and quality of oscillations. It is publicly available as a MATLAB
package.

z>2.15 is about an order of magnitude greater than the number of z>2.15 quasars
known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest
emission lines (CIV, CIII], MgII). The catalog identifies 29,580 broad
absorption line quasars and lists their characteristics. For each object, the
catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry together with
some information on the optical morphology and the selection criteria. When
available, the catalog also provides information on the optical variability of
quasars using SDSS and PTF multi-epoch photometry. The catalog also contains
X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the
quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital
spectra, covering the wavelength region 3,600-10,500A at a spectral resolution
in the range 1,300<R<2,500, can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog Archive
Server.

deep space to newly discovered particles produced in Large Hadron Collider,
should be described by the same fundamental physical quantities. However, two
distinct sets of properties are used to describe resonances: the pole
parameters (complex pole position and residue) and the Breit-Wigner parameters
(mass, width, and branching fractions). There is an ongoing decades-old debate
on which of them should be abandoned. In this study of nucleon resonances
emerging in the elastic pion-nucleon scattering we discover an intricate
interplay of the parameters from both sets, and realize that neither set is
completely independent or fundamental on its own.

Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV show a suppression of Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) production
relative to expectations from the Upsilon yield in p+p collisions scaled by the
number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll), with an indication that
the Upsilon(1S) state is also suppressed. The present measurement extends the
number of participant nucleons in the collision (Npart) by 20% compared to
Au+Au collisions, and allows us to study a system with higher energy density.
We observe a suppression in both the Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) and Upsilon(1S) yields
in central U+U data, which consolidates and extends the previously observed
suppression trend in Au+Au collisions.

main-sequence primaries and evolved secondaries with active surface regions
(dark or bright spots) resulting from magnetic activity or ongoing transfer of

systems available today at large telescopes. A critical aspect for these WFAO
systems in order to deliver an optimised performance is the knowledge of the
vertical spatiotemporal distribution of the CN2 and the wind speed. Previous
studies (Cortes et al., 2012) already proved the ability of GeMS (the Gemini
Multi-Conjugated AO system) in retrieving CN2 and wind vertical stratification
using the telemetry data. To assess the reliability of the GeMS wind speed
estimates a preliminary study (Neichel et al., 2014) compared wind speed
retrieved from GeMS with that obtained with the atmospherical model Meso-Nh on
a small sample of nights providing promising results. The latter technique is
very reliable for the wind speed vertical stratification. The model outputs
gave, indeed, an excellent agreement with a large sample of radiosoundings (~
50) both in statistical terms and on individual flights (Masciadri et al.,
2013). Such a tool can therefore be used as a valuable reference in this
exercise of cross calibrating GeMS on-sky wind estimates with model
predictions. In this contribution we achieved a two-fold results: (1) we
extended analysis on a much richer statistical sample (~ 43 nights), we
confirmed the preliminary results and we found an even better correlation
between GeMS observations and the atmospherical model with basically no cases
of not-negligible uncertainties; (2) we evaluate the possibility to use, as an
input for GeMS, the Meso-Nh estimates of the wind speed stratification in an
operational configuration. Under this configuration these estimates can be
provided many hours in advanced with respect to the observations and with a
very high temporal frequency (order of 2 minutes or less).

""infected"" nodes after an epidemic outbreak or a propagation of
rumors/worms/viruses, how can we infer the sources of the cascade? Answering
this challenging question is critical for computer forensic, vulnerability
analysis, and risk management. Despite recent interest towards this problem,
most of existing works focus only on single source detection or simple network
topologies, e.g. trees or grids.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify infection sources by
searching for a seed set $S$ that minimizes the \emph{symmetric difference}
between the cascade from $S$ and $V_I$, the given set of infected nodes. Our
major result is an approximation algorithm, called SISI, to identify infection
sources \emph{without the prior knowledge on the number of source nodes}. SISI,
to our best knowledge, is the first algorithm with \emph{provable guarantee}
for the problem in general graphs. It returns a
$\frac{2}{(1-\epsilon)^2}\Delta$-approximate solution with high probability,
where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum number of nodes in $V_I$ that may infect a
single node in the network. Our experiments on real-world networks show the
superiority of our approach and SISI in detecting true source(s), boosting the
F1-measure from few percents, for the state-of-the-art NETSLEUTH, to
approximately 50\%.

Different choices of such function allow to reproduce the behaviour of
different dark fluids. In particular, the Gordon ansatz is suitable for the
description of various kinds of slowly-moving fluids, whereas the Kerr-Schild
one is shown to describe a null dark energy component. The motion of those dark
fluids with respect to the CMB is shown to generate, in turn, a relative motion

N-body simulation on the basis of triaxial modelling. In order to understand
the difference between the simulation results and the conventional ellipsoidal
collapse model (EC), we first consider the evolution of individual simulated
halos. The major difference between EC and the simulation becomes appreciable
after the turn-around epoch. Moreover, it is sensitive to the individual
evolution history of each halo. Despite such strong dependence on individual
halos, the resulting nonsphericity of halos exhibits weak but robust mass
dependence in a statistical fashion; massive halos are more spherical up to the
turn-around, but gradually become less spherical by z = 0. This is clearly
inconsistent with the EC prediction; massive halos are usually more spherical.
In addition, at z=0, inner regions of the halos are less spherical than outer
regions, i.e., the density distribution inside the halos is highly
inhomogeneous and therefore not self-similar. Since most of previous fitting
formulae for the PDF of axis ratio of triaxial ellipsoids have been constructed
under the self-similarity assumption, they are not accurate. Indeed, we compute
the PDF of projected axis ratio a1/a2 directly from the simulation data without
the self-similarity assumption, and find that it is very sensitive to the
assumption. The latter needs to be carefully taken into account in direct
comparison with observations, and therefore we provide an empirical fitting
formula for the PDF of a1/a2. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the
derived PDF of a1/a2 roughly agrees with the current weak-lensing observations.
More importantly, the present results will be useful in future exploration of
the non-sphericity of clusters in X-ray and optical observations.

to determine free flight drag coefficients with an accuracy of 1-2%,
accomplished by measuring near and far velocities of projectiles in flight over
a known distance. Until recently, Doppler radar has been prohibitively
expensive for many users. This paper reports results of exploring potential
applications and accuracy using a recently available, inexpensive (< $600 US)
amateur Doppler radar system to determine drag coefficients for projectiles of
various sizes (4.4 mm to 9 mm diameter) and speeds (M0.3 to M3.0). In many
cases, drag coefficients can be determined with an accuracy of 1% or better if
signal-to-noise ratio is sufficient and projectiles vary little between trials.
It is also straightforward to design experiments for determining drag over a
wide range of velocities. Experimental approaches and limitations are
described. Overall, the amateur radar system shows greater accuracy, ease of
use, and simplicity compared with optical chronographs. Doppler radar has
advantages of working well with less accurate projectiles without putting
equipment at risk of projectile impact downrange. The system can also detect
phenomena that optical chronographs cannot, such as projectile instability
resulting in tumbling in flight. This technology may be useful in introductory
physics labs, aerodynamics labs, and for accurately determining drag and
ballistic coefficients of projectiles used in military, law enforcement, and
sporting applications. The most significant limitations are reduced
signal-to-noise with smaller projectiles (< 5 mm diameter) and inability to
detect projectiles more than 100 m down range.

depletion regime of SnS devices is explained by the finite carrier screening
length effect which causes the existence of a conductive surface layer from
intrinsic defects induced holes in SnS. Through etching and n-type surface
doping by Cs2CO3 to reduce/compensate the not-gatable holes near SnS flake's

strong line-of-sight photospheric magnetic fields. Several authors, for
example, have noted the spatial relationship between Ellerman bombs (EBs) and
Moving Magnetic Features (MMFs), regions of flux which disconnect from a
sunspot or pore before propagating away in the moat flow and often displaying
evidence of cancellation. In this article, data collected by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
are analysed in an attempt to understand the potential links between such
cancellation and UV burst formation. Two MMFs from AR 11579, three bi-poles
from AR 11765, and six bi-poles (four of which were co-spatial to IRIS bursts)
in AR 11850 were identified for analysis. All of these cancellation features
were found to have lifetimes of the order hours and cancellation rates of the
order 10^14-10^15 Mx s^-1. H-alpha line wing data from the Dunn Solar
Telescope's Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer were also available for
AR 11579 facilitating a discussion of links between MMFs and EBs. Using an
algebraic model of photospheric magnetic reconnection, the measured
cancellation rates are then used to ascertain estimates of certain quantities
(such as up-flow speeds, jet extents, and potential energy releases) which
compared reasonably to the properties of EBs reported within the literature.
Our results suggest that cancellation rates of the order measured here are
capable of supplying enough energy to drive certain UV bursts (including EBs),
however, they are not a guaranteeing condition for burst formation.

absorption in gold nanoparticle suspensions. A canonical spherical geometry is
considered consisting of a spherical suspension of colloidal gold nanoparticles
characterized as an arbitrary passive dielectric material which is immersed in
an arbitrary lossy medium. A relative heating coefficient and a corresponding
optimal near field excitation are defined taking the skin effect of the
surrounding medium into account. For small particle suspensions the optimal
excitation is an electric dipole field for which explicit asymptotic
expressions are readily obtained. It is then proven that the optimal
permittivity function yielding a maximal absorption inside the spherical
suspension is a conjugate match with respect to the surrounding lossy material.
For a surrounding medium consisting of a weak electrolyte solution the optimal
conjugate match can then readily be realized at a single frequency, e.g., by
tuning the parameters of a Drude model corresponding to the electrophoretic
particle acceleration mechanism. As such, the conjugate match can also be
regarded to yield an optimal plasmonic resonance. Finally, a convex
optimization approach is used to investigate the realizability of a passive
material to approximate the desired conjugate match over a finite bandwidth.
The relation of the proposed approach to general Mie theory as well as to the
approximation of metamaterials are discussed. Numerical examples are included

8-10 m-class ground-based telescopes of a complete volume-limited (DL<40 Mpc)
sample of 24 Seyfert galaxies selected from the Swift/BAT nine month catalog.
We use those MIR images to study the nuclear and circumnuclear emission of the
galaxies. Using different methods to classify the MIR morphologies on scales of
~400 pc, we find that the majority of the galaxies (75-83%) are extended or
possibly extended and 17-25% are point-like. This extended emission is compact
and it has low surface brightness compared with the nuclear emission, and it
represents, on average, ~30% of the total MIR emission of the galaxies in the
sample. We find that the galaxies whose circumnuclear MIR emission is dominated
by star formation show more extended emission (650+-700 pc) than AGN-dominated
systems (300+-100 pc). In general, the galaxies with point-like MIR
morphologies are face-on or moderately inclined (b/a~0.4-1.0), and we do not
find significant differences between the morphologies of Sy1 and Sy2. We used
the nuclear and circumnuclear fluxes to investigate their correlation with
different AGN and SF activity indicators. We find that the nuclear MIR emission
(the inner ~70 pc) is strongly correlated with the X-ray emission (the harder
the X-rays the better the correlation) and with the [O IV] lambda 25.89 micron
emission line, indicating that it is AGN-dominated. We find the same results,
although with more scatter, for the circumnuclear emission, which indicates
that the AGN dominates the MIR emission in the inner ~400 pc of the galaxies,
with some contribution from star formation.

with time-dependent objective functions, while the ones with a changing number
of objectives have rarely been considered in the literature. Instead of
changing the shape or position of the Pareto-optimal front/set when having
time-dependent objective functions, increasing or decreasing the number of
objectives usually leads to the expansion or contraction of the dimension of
the Pareto-optimal front/set manifold. Unfortunately, most existing dynamic
handling techniques can hardly be adapted to this type of dynamics. In this
paper, we report our attempt toward tackling the dynamic multi-objective
optimization problems with a changing number of objectives. We implement a new
two-archive evolutionary algorithm which maintains two co-evolving populations
simultaneously. In particular, these two populations are complementary to each
other: one concerns more about the convergence while the other concerns more
about the diversity. The compositions of these two populations are adaptively
reconstructed once the environment changes. In addition, these two populations
interact with each other via a mating selection mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on various benchmark problems with a time-dependent
number of objectives. Empirical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed algorithm.

optimization perspective. In the dynamic maximum flow problem, the goal is to
maximize the flow reaching the sink within a given time horizon $T$, while flow
requires a certain travel time to traverse an edge.
  In our setting, we account for uncertain travel times of flow. We investigate
maximum flows over time under the assumption that at most $\Gamma$ travel times
may be prolonged simultaneously due to delay. We develop and study a
mathematical model for this problem. As the dynamic robust flow problem
generalizes the static version, it is NP-hard to compute an optimal flow.
However, our dynamic version is considerably more complex than the static
version. We show that it is NP-hard to verify feasibility of a given candidate
solution. Furthermore, we investigate temporally repeated flows and show that
in contrast to the non-robust case (that is, without uncertainties) they no
longer provide optimal solutions for the robust problem, but rather yield a
worst case optimality gap of at least $T$. We finally show that the optimality
gap is at most $O(\eta k \log T)$, where $\eta$ and $k$ are newly introduced
instance characteristics and provide a matching lower bound instance with
optimality gap $\Omega(\log T)$ and $\eta = k = 1$. The results obtained in

evaluate the extraction of energy from the holographic stress tensor, and find
that Bob always gains energy extraction in our protocol. This could be related
to the positive energy theorem of the dual gravity. Moreover, the ratio of

as well. The analysis given in this paper proves further that EFCMs can achieve
arbitrarily high order in a routine manner which allows us to construct
higher-order methods for solving systems of first-order ordinary differential

highly unstable close to neutron stars and responsible for X-ray variability by
factors $10^3$ on time scale of hours. Disk driven flows feature slower state
transitions and quasi periodic oscillations related to orbital motion and
precession or resonance. On shorter time scales, and closer to the surface of
the neutron star, X-ray variability is dominated by the interactions of the
accreting flow with the spinning magnetosphere. When the pulsar magnetic field
is large, the flow is confined in a relatively narrow accretion column, whose
geometrical properties drive the observed X-ray emission. In low magnetized
systems, an increasing accretion rate allows the ignition of powerful explosive
thermonuclear burning at the neutron star surface. Transitions from rotation-

energy span from 1.8 to 5.6 GeV with both electrons and positrons makes it
appropriate for the study of a wide spectrum of accelerator physics issues and
instrumentation related to present light sources and future lepton damping
rings. Additionally a number of these are also relevant for the beam physics of
proton accelerators. This paper, the last in a series of four, describes the
vacuum system modifications of the superconducting wigglers to accommodate the
diagnostic instrumentation for the study of electron cloud (EC) behavior within
wigglers. Earlier papers provided an overview of the accelerator physics
program, the general modifications of CESR, the modifications of the vacuum
system necessary for the conversion of CESR to the test accelerator, CesrTA,
enhanced to study such subjects as low emittance tuning methods, EC effects,
intra-beam scattering, fast ion instabilities as well as general improvements
to beam instrumentation. While the initial studies of CesrTA focussed on
questions related to the International Linear Collider damping ring design,
CESR is a very versatile storage ring, capable of studying a wide range of
accelerator physics and instrumentation questions.

charm isosinglet exotic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ binds, which we identify

and location-scale mixtures of Gaussians are only known under light-tail
assumptions; with better rates achieved by location mixtures. It is
conjectured, but not proved, that the situation should be reversed under heavy
tails assumptions. The conjecture is based on the feeling that there is no need
to achieve a good order of approximation in regions with few data (say, in the
tails), favoring location-scale mixtures which allow for spatially varying
order of approximation. Here we test the previous argument on the Gaussian
errors mean regression model with random design, for which the light tail
assumption is not required for proofs. Although we cannot invalidate the
conjecture due to the lack of lower bound, we find that even with heavy tails
assumptions, location-scale mixtures apparently perform always worst than
location mixtures. However, the proofs suggest to introduce hybrid
location-scale mixtures that are find to outperform both location and

that all tails assumptions can be released at the price of making the prior

heavy quarkonium core resides within a light hadron giving rise to four- or

the static potential in the presence of a variety of light mesons as well as of
octet and decuplet baryons. In all these cases, the resulting configurations
are favoured energetically. The associated binding energies between the
quarkonium in the heavy quark limit and the light hadron are found to be
smaller than a few MeV, similar in strength to deuterium binding. It needs to
be seen if the small attraction survives in the infinite volume limit and

dots. It has been viewed alternately as a hazard, especially when the lowest
valley-orbit splitting is small compared to the thermal energy, or as an asset,
most prominently in proposals to use the valley degree of freedom itself as a
qubit. Here we present experiments in which microwave electric field driving
induces transitions between both valley-orbit and spin states. We show that
this system is highly nonlinear and can be understood through the use of
dressed photon-orbital states, enabling a unified understanding of the six
microwave resonance lines we observe. Some of these resonances are inter-valley
spin transitions that arise from a non-adiabatic process in which both the
valley and the spin degree of freedom are excited simultaneously. For these
transitions, involving a change in valley-orbit state, we find a tenfold
increase in sensitivity to electric fields and electrical noise compared to
pure spin transitions, strongly reducing the phase coherence when changes in
valley-orbit index are incurred. In contrast to this non-adiabatic transition,
the pure spin transitions, whether arising from harmonic or subharmonic
generation, are shown to be adiabatic in the orbital sector. The non-linearity
of the system is most strikingly manifest in the observation of a dynamical
anti-crossing between a spin-flip, inter-valley transition and a three-photon
transition enabled by the strong nonlinearity we find in this seemly simple
system.

access the information of criticality and excitations of one-dimensional
quantum systems by a matrix product state (MPS) defined in the (imaginary) time
direction. This state, dubbed as time MPS (tMPS), is a boundary state of tensor
network (TN) that represents the ground-state simulation after Trotter-Suzuki
decomposition. We show that the tMPS exhibits the structure of the continuous
MPS originally proposed for the field theories. The information of excitations,
e.g., dynamic correlation length and energy gap, can be accurately calculated
from the tMPS. The non-universal renormalization of velocity of the excitations
is given by a ratio between the correlations of the ground state and the tMPS.
When the system is at the quantum critical point, the tMPS is found to show the
logarithmic scaling law, where the scaling coefficient gives the central charge
that characterizes the criticality of the theory. Our work also implies that
the spectra of the transfer matrices defined by the ground state and tMPS
provide information of the low-lying masses of the theory in the continuous
limit. This could help to understand the role of the finiteness of the bond
dimension as an infra red regulator. Furthermore, we show from the perspective
of methodology that, the tMPS emerges from a generalized TN ab-initio
optimization principle scheme, which unifies the infinite density matrix
renormalization group and the infinite time-evolving block decimation
algorithms.

throughput of directed networks, it is a notorious open problem whether coding
yields any advantage over the multicommodity flow (MCF) rate in undirected
networks. It was conjectured by Li and Li (2004) that the answer is ""no"". In
this paper we show that even a small advantage over MCF can be amplified to
yield a near-maximum possible gap.
  We prove that any undirected network with $k$ source-sink pairs that exhibits
a $(1+\varepsilon)$ gap between its MCF rate and its network coding rate can be
used to construct a family of graphs $G'$ whose gap is $\log(|G'|)^c$ for some
constant $c < 1$. The resulting gap is close to the best currently known upper
bound, $\log(|G'|)$, which follows from the connection between MCF and sparsest
cuts.
  Our construction relies on a gap-amplifying graph tensor product that, given
two graphs $G_1,G_2$ with small gaps, creates another graph $G$ with a gap that
is equal to the product of the previous two, at the cost of increasing the size
of the graph. We iterate this process to obtain a gap of $\log(|G'|)^c$ from
any initial gap.

for identifying the topics of input text fields, such as login ids, passwords,
emails, dates and phone numbers, have to be manually configured. Moreover, the
rules for one application are very often not suitable for another. In addition,
when several rules conflict and match an input text field to more than one

This paper presents a natural-language approach to automatically identify the
topics of encountered input fields during crawling by semantically comparing
their similarities with the input fields in labeled corpus. In our evaluation

that control the shapes of activation functions. These parameters are trained
along with other parameters in the NN. AAFs have improved performance of Neural
Networks (NN) in multiple classification tasks. In this paper, we propose and
apply AAFs on feedforward NNs for regression tasks. We argue that applying AAFs
in the regression (second-to-last) layer of a NN can significantly decrease the
bias of the regression NN. However, using existing AAFs may lead to
overfitting. To address this problem, we propose a Smooth Adaptive Activation
Function (SAAF) with piecewise polynomial form which can approximate any
continuous function to arbitrary degree of error. NNs with SAAFs can avoid
overfitting by simply regularizing the parameters. In particular, an NN with
SAAFs is Lipschitz continuous given a bounded magnitude of the NN parameters.
We prove an upper-bound for model complexity in terms of fat-shattering
dimension for any Lipschitz continuous regression model. Thus, regularizing the
parameters in NNs with SAAFs avoids overfitting. We empirically evaluated NNs
with SAAFs and achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple regression
datasets.

based on the Conventional Approach (CA) proposed to deal with the noise issue
in the squared domain of the acquired magnitude MRI, where the noise
distribution follows a Chi-square model rather than the Rician one. In the CA
filtering method, the local samples around each voxel is used to estimate the
unknown signal value. Intrinsically, such a method fails to achieve the best
results where the underlying signal values have different statistical
properties. On the contrary, our proposal takes advantage of the data
redundancy and self-similarity properties of real MR images to improve the
noise removal performance. In other words, in our approach, the statistical
momentums of the given 3D MR volume are first calculated to explore the similar
patches inside a defined search volume. Then, these patches are put together to
obtain the noise-free value for each voxel under processing. The experimental
results on the synthetic as well as the clinical MR data show our proposed
method outperforms the other compared denoising filters.

FPGAs, namely Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration, to improve the resilience of
critical systems that take advantage of this technology. Commercial
of-the-shelf state-of-the-art FPGA devices use SRAM cells for the configuration
memory, which allow an increase in both performance and capacity. The fast
access times and unlimited number of writes of this technology, reduces
reconfiguration delays and extends the device lifetime but, at the same time,
makes them more sensitive to radiation effects, in the form of Single Event
Upsets. To overcome this limitation, manufacturers have proposed a few fault
tolerant approaches, which rely on space/time redundancy and configuration
memory content recovery - scrubbing. In this paper, we first present radiation
effects on these devices and investigate the applicability of the most commonly
used fault tolerant approaches, and then propose an approach to improve FPGA
resilience, through the use of a less intrusive failure prediction scrubbing.
It is expected that this approach relieves the system designer from
dependability concerns and reduces both time intrusiveness and overall power
consumption.

authors in earlier publications, we estimate the magnitude of radial mass
accretion/excretion rates across the disks of six nearby spiral galaxies having

bulge building and secular morphological evolution along the Hubble sequence.
Stellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies are derived from SINGS
3.6um and SDSS i-band images. Corresponding molecular and atomic gas surface
densities are derived from published CO(1-0) and HI interferometric
observations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The mass flow rate
calculations utilize a volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular
momentum exchange rate between the basic state disk matter and density wave
modes. The potential-density phase shift approach yields angular momentum
transport rates several times higher than those estimated using the Lynden-Bell
and Kalnajs (1972) approach. The current approach leads to predictions of
significant mass redistribution induced by the quasi-steady density wave modes,
enough for the morphological types of disks to evolve substantially within its
lifetime. This difference with the earlier conclusions of Lynden-Bell and
Kalnajs reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the
secular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady
density wave modes, thus enabling significant morphological transformation
along the Hubble sequence during a Hubble time. We show for the first time
also, using observational data, that STELLAR mass accretion/excretion is just
as important, and oftentimes much more important, than the corresponding
accretion/excretion processes in the GASEOUS component, with the latter being
what had been emphasized in most of the previous secular evolution studies.

hydrophilicity by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. By shifting the Fermi
level of graphene away from its Dirac point, via either chemical or electrical

simple shifting of its Fermi level, exemplifies applications in the area of

only for the player having the higher offensive expertise (the dominant player
), maximizing the offensive always increases the probability to win. For the
non-dominant player, interestingly, a complete minimization of the offensive
becomes the best way to win in many situations, depending on the relative
values of the defense expertise. Further simulations on the interplay of
defense expertise were done separately, in the context of a fully-offensive
scenario, offering a starting point for analytical treatments. In particular,
we established that in this scenario the total number of moves is defined only

is entangled with the radiation. For astrophysical blackhole, the mass
distribution is sharply peak about its average value with a vanishingly small
