the Bloch-Torrey equation, and is fundamental to MR modalities which are
sensitive to spin dynamics such as diffusion MRI. Such modalities have received
a great deal of interest in the research literature over the last few years,
resulting in a huge range of models and methods.
  In this work we make make use of a more general Bloch-Torrey equation with a

candidate enabling technologies for the next generation of wireless networks
since they benefit from both the high data rates of the FSO subsystem and the
high reliability of the RF subsystem. In this paper, we focus on the problem of
throughput maximization in the parallel hybrid RF/FSO relay channel. In the
parallel hybrid RF/FSO relay channel, a source node sends its data to a
destination node with the help of multiple relay nodes. Thereby, for a given
relay, the source-relay and the relay-destination FSO links are orthogonal with
respect to each other due to the narrow beam employed for FSO transmission,
whereas, due to the broadcast nature of the RF channel, half-duplex operation
is required for the RF links if self-interference is to be avoided. Moreover,
we consider the two cases where the relays are and are not equipped with
buffers. For both cases, we derive the optimal relay selection policies for the
RF and FSO links and the optimal time allocation policy for transmission and
reception for the RF links. The proposed optimal protocols provide important
insights for optimal system design. Since the optimal buffer-aided (BA) policy
introduces an unbounded end-to-end delay, we also propose a suboptimal BA
policy which ensures certain target average delays. Moreover, we present
distributed implementations for both proposed optimal protocols. Simulation
results demonstrate that a considerable gain can be achieved by the proposed
adaptive protocols in comparison with benchmark schemes from the literature.

  Aims: Kepler data of three known Be stars are re-visited to establish their
pulsational nature and assess the properties of additional, non-pulsational
variations. The three program stars turned out to be one inactive Be star, one
active, continuously outbursting Be star, and one Be star transiting from a
non-outbursting into an outbursting phase, thus forming an excellent sample to
distill properties of Be stars in the various phases of their life-cycle.
  Methods: [abbreviated]
  Results: The short-term photometric variability of Be stars must be
disentangled into a stellar and a circumstellar part. The stellar part is on
the whole not different from what is seen in non-Be stars. However, some of the
observed phenomena might be to be due to resonant mode coupling, a mechanism
not typically considered for B-type stars. Short-term circumstellar variability
comes in the form of either a group of relatively well-defined, short-lived
frequencies during outbursts, which are called \v{S}tefl frequencies, and broad
bumps in the power spectra, indicating aperiodic variability on a time scale
similar to typical low-order $g$-mode pulsation frequencies, rather than true
periodicity.
  Conclusions: From a stellar pulsation perspective, Be stars are rapidly
rotating SPB stars, that is they pulsate in low order $g$-modes, even if the
rapid rotation can project the observed frequencies into the traditional
high-order $p$-mode regime above about 4 c/d. However, when a circumstellar
disk is present, Be star power spectra are complicated by both cyclic, or
periodic, and aperiodic circumstellar phenomena, possibly even dominating the
power spectrum.

share neighbors are often also directly connected to each other. A network's
clustering can be a useful indicator of its connectedness and community
structure. Algorithms for generating networks with high clustering have been
developed, but typically rely on adding or removing edges and nodes, sometimes
from a completely empty network. Here, we introduce algorithms that create a
highly clustered network by starting with an existing network and rearranging
edges, without adding or removing them; these algorithms can preserve other
network properties even as the clustering increases. They rely on local
rewiring rules, in which a single edge changes one of its vertices in a way
that is guaranteed to increase clustering. This greedy step can be applied
iteratively to transform a random network into a form with much higher
clustering. Additionally, the algorithms presented grow a network's clustering
faster than they increase its path length, meaning that network enters a regime
of comparatively high clustering and low path length: a small world. These
algorithms may be a basis for how real-world networks rearrange themselves
organically to achieve or maintain high clustering and small-world structure.

illustrate that the temporal correlations of interference and outage are
location-dependent, being lower close to the centre of the domain, where the
level of mobility is higher than near the boundary. Close to the boundary, more
time is also needed to see uncorrelated interference. Our findings suggest that
an accurate description of the mobility pattern is important, because it leads

magnetization but have the potential for large spin-polarization and strong out
of plane magnetic anisotropy, and, hence, are ideal candidates for high density
memory applications. Here, we demonstrate that a fully compensated magnetic
state with a tunable magnetic anisotropy is realized in Mn-Pt-Ga based
tetragonal Heusler thin films. Furthermore, we show that a bilayer formed from
a fully compensated and a partially compensated Mn-Pt-Ga layer, exhibits a
large interfacial exchange bias up to room temperature. The present work
establishes a novel design principle for spintronic devices that are formed
from materials with similar elemental compositions and nearly identical crystal

to their improved properties such as thermal stability. The flexible nature of
Heusler materials to achieve tunable magnetizations, and anisotropies within

related distributions for the accompanying cascade of chaotic band-splitting

regular and chaotic dynamics gives rise to either multiscale or gaussian limit
distributions. As demonstrated before (J. Stat. Mech. P01001 (2010)), sums of
trajectory positions associated with the chaotic-band attractors of the
logistic map lead only to a gaussian limit distribution, but, as we show here,
the features of the stationary multiscale distribution at the Feigenbaum point
can be observed in the distributions obtained from finite sums with
sufficiently small number of terms. The multiscale features are acquired from
the repellor preimage structure that dominates the dynamics toward the chaotic
attractors. When the number of chaotic bands increases this hierarchical
structure with multiscale and discrete scale-invariant properties develops.
Also, we suggest that the occurrence of truncated q-gaussian-shaped
distributions for specially prescribed sums are t-Student distributions

coherence effects should be treated with a special care. The results for the
nucleus-to-nucleon production ratio available in the literature so far are
usually based on the assumption of a very long coherence length (LCL) $l_c\gg
R_A$. Since the onset of coherence effects is controlled by the coherence
length $l_c$, we estimated its magnitude in various kinematic regions of the DY
process and found that the LCL approximation should not be used at small and
medium c.m. collision energies ($\sqrt{s} \lesssim 200$ GeV) as well as at
large dilepton invariant masses. In order to obtain realistic predictions, we
computed for the first time the DY cross section using the generalised color
dipole approach based on the rigorous Green function formalism, which naturally
incorporates the color transparency and quantum coherence effects and hence
allows to estimate the nuclear shadowing with no restrictions on the CL. In
addition to the shadowing effect, we studied a complementary effect of initial
state interactions (ISI) that causes an additional suppression at large values
of the Feynman variable. Numerical results for the nuclear modification factor
accounting for the ISI effect and the finite $l_c$ are compared to the data
available from the fixed-target FNAL measurements and a good agreement has been

  Nhan Hao Tran","The neutron within the deuteron as a surrogate for neutron-induced
  reactions","16 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the use of neutron poisons in reactions induced by radioactive
beams as a test of theoretical models aiming to relate neutron capture in
nuclei with neutron surrogate reactions such as (d,p) reactions. We exploit the
approximations necessary to obtain a direct relation between the two reactions;
surrogate vs. neutron capture. We also show how this is intimately related to
the momentum distribution of the neutron within the deuteron. The models we use
are based on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the
treatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. Such theories were
developed in the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431
(1985)], Udagawa and Tamura [Phys. Rev. C 24, 1348 (1981)] and Hussein and
McVoy [Nucl. Phys. A 445, 124 (1985)]. We use these theories to derive an
expression for the proton yield in the reaction A(d,p)B. The capture reaction
$n + A \rightarrow B$ is then extracted using reasonable approximations. By
recalling an old method proposed by Serber [Phys. Rev. 80, 1098 (1950); Nature
166, 709 (1950)] we explain how the momentum distribution of neutrons within
the deuteron will depend on the short-range dependence of the nucleon-nucleon
force. The relevance of our work to nucleosynthesis in the rapid neutron
capture process is emphasized.

relativistic point charges are the same as in literature, i.e. Gauss's law is
valid. However results for time-varying classical and relativistic distributed
charges indicate that divergence of electric field is not zero even for volumes
of space where no charges are present. For these cases original Gauss's law
might require modification. Divergence of electric field seems to be far-field
type scalar anisotropic field, which is generated by time-varying electric
charges or currents. Results indicate that for these effects to be sufficiently
large to be experimentally observable the time variation of electric charges
and/or of currents should be very fast. Divergence of magnetic field is zero

the black hole is a member of a binary system on a slowly-moving,

their hyperbolic and plasmonic response, which, however, is considered to be

leading to frequency regimes of magnetic hyperbolic dispersion. We investigate

the stability of skyrmions, it is essential to incorporate the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and the out-of-plane magnetic field
into the system. In this work, we explore a system without these interactions.
First, we propose a controlled way for the creation of magnetic skyrmions and
skyrmioniums imprinted on a ferromagnetic nanotrack via a nanopatterned
nanodisk with the magnetic vortex state. Then we investigate the detachment of
the imprinted spin textures from the underneath of the nanodisk, as well as its
transport by the spin-transfer torque imposed by spin-polarized current pulses
applied in the nanotrack. A prominent feature of the moving imprinted spin
texture is that its topological number Q is oscillating around the averaged
value of Q=0 as if it is a resonant state between the skyrmions with Q= +/- 1
and the bubble with Q=0. We may call it a resonant magnetic soliton (RMS). A
RMS moves along a straight line since it is free from the skyrmion Hall effect.
In our studied device, the same electrodes are employed to realize the
imprinted spin texture detachment and its transport. In addition, we have
investigated the interaction between the RMS and a magnetic tunnel junction
sensor, where the passing of the RMS in the nanotrack can be well detected. Our
results would be useful for the development of novel spintronic devices based

solar-like stars is influenced by rotation rate and mass in presence of
magnetic fields generated by a convective dynamo. We use the ASH code to model
the convective dynamo of solar-like stars at various rotation rates and masses,
hence different effective Rossby numbers. We obtained models with either
prograde (solar-like) or retrograde (anti-solar-like) differential rotation.
The trends of differential rotation versus stellar rotation rate obtained for
simulations including the effect of the magnetic field are weaker compared with
hydro simulations ($\Delta \Omega \propto (\Omega/\Omega_{\odot})^{0.44}$ in
the MHD case and $\Delta \Omega \propto (\Omega/\Omega_{\odot})^{0.89}$ in the
hydro case), hence showing a better agreement with the observations. Analysis
of angular momentum transport revealed that the simulations with retrograde and
prograde differential rotation have opposite distribution of the viscous,

volume interaction is studied numerically on planar lattices considering
Gaussian distributions of lateral sizes of the incident particles, with several
values of the average and of the width-to-average ratio $w$. When the coverage
is plotted as function of the logarithm of time $t$, the maximum slope is
attained at a time $t_M$ of the same order of the time $\tau$ of incidence of
one monolayer, which is related to the molecular flux and/or sticking
coefficients. For various values of the average $\mu$ and $w$, we obtain
$1.5\tau < t_M < 5\tau$ for linear particles and $.3\tau< t_M < \tau$ for
square particles. At $t_M$, the coverages with linear and square particles are
near .3 and .2, respectively. Extrapolations show that coverages may vary with
$\mu$ up to 20% and 2% for linear and square particles, respectively, for
$\mu\ge 64$, fixed time, and constant $w$. All coverage $\theta$ versus $\log
t$ plots have approximately the same shape, but other quantities measured at
times of order $t_M$ help to distinguish narrow and broad incident
distributions. The adsorbed particle size distributions are close to the
incident ones up to long times for small $w$, but appreciably change in time
for larger $w$, acquiring a monotonically decreasing shape for $w = 1/2$ at
times of order $100\tau$ . At $t_M$, incident and adsorbed distributions are
approximately the same for $w \le 1/8$ and show significant differences for $w
\ge 1/2$; this result may be used as a consistency test in applications of the

energies to add an electron or a hole are vastly different ($e-h$ charging
energy asymmetry). We parameterize the $e-h$ transport asymmetry by the ratio
of the hole and electron charging energies $\eta_{e-h}$. We show that this

the observed X-rays can ionize the ejecta, eliminating lines. The SN-like light
curves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,
although a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to
power the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB. Our results
imply that TDEs are a possible energy source for SN-like events in general and

baryons they contain. The conventional interpretation of this finding is that
their dynamics is dominated by non-baryonic matter. However, there is also
strong evidence that many low-mass early-type galaxies formed as tidal dwarf
galaxies, which would contain almost no dark matter. Using an extensive
catalogue of early-type galaxies, we therefore discuss how the internal
dynamics of early-type galaxies in general can be understood by replacing the
assumption of non-baryonic dark matter with two alternative assumptions. The
first assumption is that Milgromian dynamics (i.e., MOND) is valid, which
changes the effective gravitational force in the weak-field limit. The second
assumption is that binary stars affect the observed line-of-sight velocity
dispersions. Some moderate discrepancies between observed and predicted
velocity dispersions remain also when these effects are implemented.
Nevertheless, the observed velocity dispersions in early-type galaxies can then
easily be explained without invoking the presence of non-baryonic dark matter
in them, but with already documented variations of the galaxy-wide stellar
initial mass function and non-equilibrium dynamics in some of the low-mass
early-type galaxies.

submillimeter source into three components with total flux density S_850 =
1.68+/-0.06 mJy, corresponding to a star formation rate of ~150 M_sun/yr. The
submillimeter sources are associated with several faint (m~27 mag) rest-frame
ultraviolet sources identified in Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph

spectroscopically confirmed with Keck MOSFIRE to lie within 20 projected kpc

STIS sources represent a population of low-mass star-forming satellites
surrounding the central submillimeter sources, potentially contributing to
their growth and activity through accretion. Using a high resolution
cosmological zoom simulation of a 10^13 M_sun halo at z=3, including stellar,
dust and Ly-alpha radiative transfer, we can model the ALMA+STIS observations

galactic nuclei, specifically the Milky Way, M31, M32 and M33. These are
centrally concentrated blue stars, found in three out of the four nuclear star
clusters (NSCs) considered here. Their origins are unknown, but could include
blue straggler (BS) stars, extended horizontal branch stars and young recently
formed stars. Here, we calculate order-of-magnitude estimates for various
collision rates, as a function of the host NSC environment and distance from
the cluster centre. These rates are sufficiently high that BSs, formed via
collisions between main sequence (MS) stars, could contribute non-negligibly
($\sim$ 1-10% in mass) to every surface brightness profile, with the exception
of the Milky Way. Stellar evolution models show that the envelopes of red giant
branch (RGB) stars must be nearly completely stripped to significantly affect
their photometric appearance, which requires multiple collisions. Hence, the
collision rates for individual RGB stars are only sufficiently high in the
inner $\lesssim$ 0.1 pc of M31 and M32 for RGB destruction to occur. Collisions
between white dwarfs and MS stars, which should ablate the stars, could offer a
steady and significant supply of gas in every NSC in our sample. The gas could
either fragment to form new stars, or accrete onto old MS stars already
present. Thus, collisional processes could contribute significantly to the
observed blue excesses in M31 and M33; future studies should be aimed at better
constraining theoretical predictions to compliment existing and future
observational data.

LMXBs, mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) are believed to be related to
`marginally stable' burning on the neutron star (NS) surface. Our study of
phase resolved energy spectra of these oscillations in 4U 1636-53 shows that
the oscillations are not caused by variations in the blackbody temperature of
the neutron star, but reveals a correlation between the change of the count
rate during the mHz QPO pulse and the spatial extend of a region emitting
blackbody emission. The maximum size of the emission area
$R^2_{\mathrm{BB}}=216.7^{+93.2}_{-86.4}$km$^2$, provides the direct evidence
that the oscillations originate from a variable surface area constrained on the
NS and are therefore not related to instabilities in the accretion disk. The
obtained lower limit on the size of the neutron star (11.0 km) rules out
equations of state that prefer small NS radii. Observations of mHz QPOs in NS
LMXBs with NICER and eXTP will reduce the statistical uncertainty in the lower
limit on the NS radius, which together with better estimates of the hardening
factor and distance, will allow improving discrimination between different
equations of state and compact star models. Furthermore, future missions will
allow us to measure the peak blackbody emission area for a single mHz QPO
pulse, which will push the lower limit to larger radii.

drives a synchrotron jet, which is quite exceptional for a high-mass protostar,
and is associated with a strongly polarized water maser source, W3(H$_2$O),
making it an optimal target to investigate the role of magnetic fields on the
innermost scales of protostellar disk-jet systems. The linearly polarized
emission from water masers provides clues on the orientation of the local
magnetic field, while the measurement of the Zeeman splitting from circular
polarization provides its strength. The water masers trace a bipolar, biconical
outflow at the center of the synchrotron jet. Although on scales of a few
thousand AU the magnetic field inferred from the masers is on average
orientated along the flow axis, on smaller scales (10s to 100s of AU), we have
revealed a misalignment between the magnetic field and the velocity vectors,
which arises from the compression of the field component along the shock front.
Our measurements support a scenario where the magnetic field would evolve from
having a dominant component parallel to the outflow velocity in the pre-shock
gas, with field strengths of the order of a few tens of mG (at densities of
$10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), to being mainly dominated by the perpendicular component of
order of a few hundred of mG in the post-shock gas where the water masers are
excited (at densities of $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$). The general implication is that in
the undisturbed (i.e. not-shocked) circumstellar gas, the flow velocities would
follow closely the magnetic field lines, while in the gas shocked by the
prostostellar jet the magnetic field would be re-configured to be parallel to
the shock front.

aspects) of complex Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold M to supersymmetric
partition functions (and other observables) in an associated 3d theory T[M].
Many of these observables may be computed by supersymmetric localization. We

solution, but at the weak and the strong limits of the 't Hooft coupling there
are dramatic simplifications that allows us to extract most of the interesting

Gaussian matrix model and that the free-energy scales as N^2. At strong
coupling we show that if the theory contains one adjoint hypermultiplet then
the free-energy scales as N^3. We also find the expectation value of a
supersymmetric Wilson loop that wraps the equator. We demonstrate how to
extract the effective couplings and reproduce results of Seiberg. Finally, we
compare to results for the six-dimensional (2,0) theory derived using the

that the supersymmetry is enhanced to N=2, the Wilson loop result matches the
analogous calculation using AdS/CFT. The free-energies differ by a rational

Klein tunneling. Circumventing this problem in graphene mainly relies on
carving out nanostructures or applying electric displacement fields to open a

disorder or insufficiently controlled localization of electrons. Here we
realize an alternative strategy in monolayer graphene, by combining a
homogeneous magnetic field and electrostatic confinement. Using the tip of a
scanning tunneling microscope, we induce a confining potential in the Landau
gaps of bulk graphene without the need for physical edges. Gating the localized
states towards the Fermi energy leads to regular charging sequences with more
than 40 Coulomb peaks exhibiting typical addition energies of 7-20 meV. Orbital
splittings of 4-10 meV and a valley splitting of about 3 meV for the first
orbital state can be deduced. These experimental observations are
quantitatively reproduced by tight binding calculations, which include the
interactions of the graphene with the aligned hexagonal boron nitride
substrate. The demonstrated confinement approach appears suitable to create
quantum dots with well-defined wave function properties beyond the reach of

move near boundaries, e.g., the walls of the container confining the
suspension, gradients in the composition of the solution are also created along
the wall. This give rise to chemi-osmosis (via the interactions of the wall
with the molecular species forming the solution), which drives flows coupling
back to the colloid and thus influences its motility. Employing an approximate

colloids can align with, and follow, gradients in the surface chemistry of the

thigmotaxis with the meaning of sensing the proximity of a (not necessarily

with the surface-chemistry gradient is generic for chemically active colloids

does not depend on the exact details of the propulsion mechanism. The results

assess the putative causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. The approach is
robust to violations of the (untestable) Exclusion Restriction condition, and
hence it does not require instruments to be independent of the outcome
conditional on the exposure and on the confounders of the exposure-outcome
relationship. The Bayesian approach offers a rigorous handling of the
uncertainty (e.g. about the estimated instrument-exposure associations),
freedom from asymptotic approximations of the null distribution and the
possibility to elaborate the model in any direction of scientific relevance. We
illustrate the last feature with the aid of a study of the metabolic mediators
of the disease-inducing effects of obesity, where we elaborate the model to
investigate whether the causal effect of interest interacts with a covariate.
The proposed model contains a vector of unidentifiable parameters, $\beta$,
whose $j$th element represents the pleiotropic (i.e., not mediated by the
exposure) component of the association of instrument $j$ with the outcome. We
deal with the incomplete identifiability by assuming that the pleiotropic
effect of some instruments is null, or nearly so, formally by imposing on
$\beta$ Carvalho's horseshoe shrinkage prior, in such a way that different
components of $\beta$ are subjected to different degrees of shrinking,
adaptively and in accord with the compatibility of each individual instrument
with the hypothesis of no pleiotropy. This prior requires a minimal input from
the user. We present the results of a simulation study into the performance of
the proposed method under different types of pleiotropy and sample sizes.
Comparisons with the performance of the weighted median estimator are made.
Choice of the prior and inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo are discussed.

depth data information which is used to construct a depth map. Hands

applied to partition pixels into two groups corresponding to each signer's

hand's contour pixels. Fourier descriptors, derived form centroid distance is
used as a hand shape representation. For each number gesture there are 15
Fourier descriptors coefficients generated which represent uniquely that

of signals defined on its nodes. Fundamentally, the unknown graph encodes
direct relationships between signal elements, which we aim to recover from
observable indirect relationships generated by a diffusion process on the
graph. The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from convex
optimization and stationarity of graph signals, in order to identify the graph
shift operator (a matrix representation of the graph) given only its
eigenvectors. These spectral templates can be obtained, e.g., from the sample
covariance of independent graph signals diffused on the sought network. The
novel idea is to find a graph shift that, while being consistent with the
provided spectral information, endows the network with certain desired
properties such as sparsity. To that end we develop efficient inference
algorithms stemming from provably-tight convex relaxations of natural nonconvex
criteria, particularizing the results for two shifts: the adjacency matrix and
the normalized Laplacian. Algorithms and theoretical recovery conditions are
developed not only when the templates are perfectly known, but also when the
eigenvectors are noisy or when only a subset of them are given. Numerical tests
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in recovering social,

that are non-Euclidean and specifically do not lie in a vector space. To
address the need for statistical methods for such data, we introduce the
concept of Fr\'echet regression. This is a general approach to regression when
responses are complex random objects in a metric space and predictors are in
$\mathcal{R}^p$, achieved by extending the classical concept of a Fr\'echet
mean to the notion of a conditional Fr\'echet mean. We develop generalized
versions of both global least squares regression and local weighted least
squares smoothing. The target quantities are appropriately defined population
versions of global and local regression for response objects in a metric space.
We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding fitted
regressions using observed data to the population targets under suitable
regularity conditions by applying empirical process methods. For the special
case of random objects that reside in a Hilbert space, such as regression
models with vector predictors and functional data as responses, we obtain a
limit distribution. The proposed methods have broad applicability. Illustrative
examples include responses that consist of probability distributions and
correlation matrices, and we demonstrate both global and local Fr\'echet
regression for demographic and brain imaging data. Local Fr\'echet regression
is also illustrated via a simulation with response data which lie on the
sphere.

the ionic states. Actually, the NCA solution describes an overscreened Kondo
effect, because it is the same as for the two-channel infinite-$U$ single level

between these two very different physical systems, independently of
temperature. Using the impurity entropy as an example, we show that the low
temperature values of the NCA entropy for the symmetric case yield the limit
$S_{imp}(T=0)\rightarrow \ln\sqrt{2},$ which corresponds to the zero

predicted for any other thermodynamic property. On the other hand, we have
found that the OCA approach lifts the artificial mapping between the models and
restores correct properties of the ground-state, for instance, a vanishing
entropy at low enough temperatures $S_{imp}(T=0)\rightarrow0$. Our results
indicate that the very well known NCA should be used with caution close to the
symmetric point of the Anderson model.

sophisticated models of nuclear structure with Bayesian neural networks (BNN)
to generate predictions for the charge radii of thousands of nuclei throughout
the nuclear chart. A class of relativistic energy density functionals is used
to provide robust predictions for nuclear charge radii. In turn, these
predictions are refined through Bayesian learning for a neural network that is
trained using residuals between theoretical predictions and the experimental

fairly good description of experiment, our results show significant improvement
(better than 40%) after BNN refinement. Moreover, these improved results for
nuclear charge radii are supplemented with theoretical error bars. We have
successfully demonstrated the ability of the BNN approach to significantly
increase the accuracy of nuclear models in the predictions of nuclear charge

to identify the mixture of air pollutants for a region. In this study of air
quality in the Houston metropolitan area we apply dynamic principal component
analysis (DPCA) to a normalized multivariate time series of daily concentration
measurements of five pollutants (O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5) from January 1, 2009
through December 31, 2011 for each of the 24 hours in a day. The resulting
dynamic components are examined by hour across days for the 3 year period.
Diurnal and seasonal patterns are revealed underlining times when DPCA performs
best and two principal components (PCs) explain most variability in the
multivariate series. DPCA is shown to be superior to static principal component
analysis (PCA) in discovery of linear relations among transformed pollutant
measurements. DPCA captures the time-dependent correlation structure of the
underlying pollutants recorded at up to 34 monitoring sites in the region. In
winter mornings the first principal component (PC1) (mainly CO and NO2)
explains up to 70% of variability. Augmenting with the second principal
component (PC2) (mainly driven by SO2) the explained variability rises to 90%.
In the afternoon, O3 gains prominence in the second principal component. The
seasonal profile of PCs' contribution to variance loses its distinction in the
afternoon, yet cumulatively PC1 and PC2 still explain up to 65% of variability
in ambient air data. DPCA provides a strategy for identifying the changing air
quality profile for the region studied.

  2016)",,,,"cs.CG cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a mathematical model of self-assembling systems, Winfree's abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM) is a remarkable platform for studying the behaviors and
powers of self-assembling systems. Capable of Turing universal computation, the
aTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed
so that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute
prescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was
shown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a
single tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set
can be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly
using that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics
modulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given
makes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key
locations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating
a directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.
The question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally
required. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed
systems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no
universal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This
provides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is
itself a fundamentally nondeterministic process. To achieve this result we
leverage powerful results of computational complexity hierarchies, including
tight bounds on both best and worst-case complexities of decidable languages,
to design systems with precisely controllable space resources available to
embedded computations. We also develop novel techniques for designing systems
containing subsystems with disjoint, mutually exclusive computational powers.

performed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step
and its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may
become highly computationally demanding. This paper introduces a general
framework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the
incremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient
estimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that,
we propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state
representation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures
to integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state
representation. SLAM++ differs from existing implementations by performing all
the matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation
and arithmetic operations. Even though this paper tests SLAM++ efficiency on
SLAM problems, its applicability remains general.

reached during the red and asymptotic giant branch (RGB and AGB, respectively)

that in the standard scenario where all ~1-8 Mo stars make a PN, at most 2.5

over-abundance of post-interaction central stars of PN cannot be easily

to be an integral part of wireless ""Smart City"" applications. The Long Term
Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) technology is a major candidate for
provisioning of MTC applications. However, due to the diverse characteristics
of payload size, transmission periodicity, power efficiency, and quality of
service (QoS) requirement, MTC poses huge challenges to LTE/LTE-A technologies.
In particular, efficient management of massive random access is one of the most
critical challenges. In case of massive random access attempts, the probability
of preamble collision drastically increases, thus the performance of LTE/LTE-A
random access degrades sharply. In this context, this article reviews the
current state-of-the-art proposals to control massive random access of MTC
devices in LTE/LTE-A networks. The proposals are compared in terms of five
major metrics, namely, access delay, access success rate, power efficiency, QoS
guarantee, and the effect on Human-Type Communications (HTC). To this end, we
propose a novel collision resolution random access model for massive MTC over
LTE/LTE-A. Our proposed model basically resolves the preamble collisions
instead of avoidance, and targets to manage massive and bursty access attempts.
Simulations of our proposed model show huge improvements in random access
success rate compared to the standard slotted-Aloha-based models. The new model
can also coexist with existing LTE/LTE-A Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol,
and ensure high reliability and time-efficient network access.

almost aligned with the line of sight. The third PN, NGC~6826 has a fast

the central star of the newly identified PN Kn61, has a PG1159 spectral type

star of the circular PN A61 does not appear to have a photometric variability

ratios of the number of trading days with rising index or the sum of the
amplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the total number of trading

market is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in
the selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment

portfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown

different parameters to select portfolios and different criteria to identify

observational campaign for providing the much needed observational input by
using wide white dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries. White dwarfs are natural

from the main sequence companions. Since the progenitors of white dwarfs and
the main sequence stars were born at the same time, WDMS binaries provide a
unique opportunity to observationally constrain in a robust way the properties
of the AMR. In this work we present the AMR derived from analysing a pilot

lack of correlation between age and metallicity at young and intermediate ages

this paper, the case with focusing optics in an LPA-driven FEL using TGU is
numerically studied, in which the dispersion function should be monotonously
decreasing along the undulator. Even though the FEL resonance is not always
satisfied for off-energy electrons in this case, through subtly optimizing the
initial dispersion and focusing parameters, it is feasible to achieve a similar
radiation power to the case assuming an ideal constant dispersion function

requirements. A detailed review of selected concepts and solutions for the LHC

volume of favorable publications in the literature, but also faced criticisms
of being ineffective and misleading in applications. In this paper, we
introduce a class of estimators that can easily produce model selection
procedures possessing the oracle property and discuss the merits of the oracle
property by analyzing the performance of such estimators in finite sample size
theoretically.
  Specifically, we propose a new type of Hodges' estimators capable of reducing
the asymptotic variance of any given estimator over a multi-dimensional
subspace of the parameter space, which can easily produce model selection
procedures with the oracle and some other desired properties. This new type of
oracle estimators, however, perform poorly at some values of the parameters for
estimation, and there is no convincing reason to declare that oracle estimators
are better than the traditional estimators such as the MLE and LSE.
Consequently, the merits of the oracle property for model selection as claimed
in the literature are probably grossly overstated, and the criticisms of the
oracle property are justifiable.

Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the energy stored in particle beams has reached a
value two orders of magnitude above previous accelerators and poses new threats
with respect to hazards from the energy stored in the particle beams. A single
accident damaging vital parts of the accelerator could interrupt operation for
years. Protection of equipment from beam accidents is mandatory. Designing a
machine protection system requires an excellent understanding of accelerator
physics and operation to anticipate possible failures that could lead to
damage. Machine protection includes beam and equipment monitoring, a system to
safely stop beam operation (e.g. extraction of the beam towards a dedicated
beam dump block or stopping the beam at low energy) and an interlock system
providing the glue between these systems. This lecture will provide an overview
of the design of protection systems for accelerators and introduce various
protection systems. The principles are illustrated with examples from LHC.

increasing stiffness on the formation of secondary structures in protein-like
systems. Two possible models are considered. In both models, a polymer chain is
formed by tethered beads where non-consecutive backbone beads attract each
other via a square-well potential representing the tendency of the chain to
fold. In addition, smaller hard spheres are attached to each non-terminal
backbone bead along the direction normal to the chain to mimic the steric
hindrance of side chains in real proteins. The two models, however, differ in
the way bending rigidity is enforced. In the first model, partial overlap
between consecutive beads is allowed. This reduces the possible bending angle
between consecutive bonds thus producing an effective entropic stiffness that
competes with a short-range attraction, and leads to a formation of secondary
structures characteristic of proteins. We discuss the low-temperature phase
diagram as a function of increasing interpenetration, and find a transition
from a planar, beta-like structure, to helical shape. In the second model, an
energetic stiffness is explicitly introduced by imposing an infinitely large
energy penalty for bending above a critical angle between consecutive bonds,
and no penalty below it. The low-temperature phase of this model does not show
any sign of protein-like secondary structures. At intermediate temperatures,
however, where the chain is still in the coil conformation but stiffness is
significant, we find the two models to predict a quite similar dependence of
the persistence length as a function of the stiffness. This behaviour is
rationalized in terms of a simple geometrical mapping between the two models.
Finally, we discuss the effect of shrinking side chains to zero, and find the
above mapping to still hold true.

  operates","To appear, Journal of Theoretical Biology",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal sex allocation theory is one of the most intricately developed areas
of evolutionary ecology. Under a range of conditions, particularly under
population sub-division, selection favours sex being allocated to offspring
non-randomly, generating non-binomial variances of offspring group sex ratios.
Detecting non-binomial sex allocation is complicated by stochastic
developmental mortality, as offspring sex can often only be identified on
maturity with the sex of non-maturing offspring remaining unknown. We show that
current approaches for detecting non-binomiality have limited ability to detect
non-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality has occurred. We
present a new procedure using an explicit model of sex allocation and mortality
and develop a Bayesian model selection approach (available as an R package). We
use the double and multiplicative binomial distributions to model over- and
under-dispersed sex allocation and show how to calculate Bayes factors for
comparing these alternative models to the null hypothesis of binomial sex
allocation. The ability to detect non-binomial sex allocation is greatly
increased, particularly in cases where mortality is common. The use of Bayesian
methods allows for the quantification of the evidence in favour of each
hypothesis, and our modelling approach provides an improved descriptive
capability over existing approaches. We use a simulation study to demonstrate
substantial improvements in power for detecting non-binomial sex allocation in
situations where current methods fail, and we illustrate the approach in real
scenarios using empirically obtained datasets on the sexual composition of
groups of gregarious parasitoid wasps.

detection, practitioners often face great needs to control type I errors (i.e.,
the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 0 observation as class 1)
so that it remains below a desired threshold. To address this need, the
Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification paradigm is a natural choice; it minimizes
type II error (i.e., the conditional probability of misclassifying a class 1
observation as class 0) while enforcing an upper bound, $\alpha$, on the type I
error. Although the NP paradigm has a century-long history in hypothesis
testing, it has not been well recognized and implemented in classification
schemes. Common practices that directly limit the empirical type I error to no
more than $\alpha$ do not satisfy the type I error control objective because
the resulting classifiers are still likely to have type I errors much larger
than $\alpha$. As a result, the NP paradigm has not been properly implemented
for many classification scenarios in practice. In this work, we develop the
first umbrella algorithm that implements the NP paradigm for all scoring-type
classification methods, including popular methods such as logistic regression,
support vector machines and random forests. Powered by this umbrella algorithm,
we propose a novel graphical tool for NP classification methods: NP receiver
operating characteristic (NP-ROC) bands, motivated by the popular receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. NP-ROC bands will help choose $\alpha$
in a data adaptive way and compare different NP classifiers. We demonstrate the
use and properties of the NP umbrella algorithm and NP-ROC bands, available in
the R package nproc, through simulation and real data case studies.

useful signatures of plasma conditions and non-local consequences of

for antiparallel reconnection and under the influence of weak guide-fields in
the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. EVDFs are, however, not
well known, yet, for oblique (or component-) reconnection in dependence on
stronger guide-magnetic fields and for the exhaust (outflow) region of
reconnection away from the diffusion region. In view of the multi-spacecraft
Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), we derived the non-Maxwellian EVDFs of
collisionless magnetic reconnection in dependence on the guide-field strength
$b_g$ from small ($b_g\approx0$) to very strong ($b_g=8$) guide-fields, taking
into account the feedback of the self-generated turbulence. For this sake, we
carried out 2.5D fully-kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations using the ACRONYM
code. We obtained anisotropic EVDFs and electron beams propagating along the
separatrices as well as in the exhaust region of reconnection. The beams are
anisotropic with a higher temperature in the direction perpendicular rather
than parallel to the local magnetic field. The beams propagate in the direction
opposite to the background electrons and cause instabilities. We also obtained
the guide-field dependence of the relative electron-beam drift speed, threshold
and properties of the resulting streaming instabilities including the strongly
non-linear saturation of the self-generated plasma turbulence. This turbulence
and its non-linear feedback cause non-adiabatic parallel electron acceleration
and EVDFs well beyond the limits of the quasi-linear approximation, producing
phase space holes and an isotropizing pitch-angle scattering.

rates between the electronic states of the emitter. The emitters show excellent
photo stability even under ambient conditions and in monolayers. Comparing the

discrete stochastic excitable dynamics with a rest and an excited state. Both
states are assumed to possess different waiting time distributions. The rest
state is treated as an activation process with an exponentially distributed
life time, whereas the latter in the excited state shall have a constant mean
which may originate from any distribution. The activation rate of any single
unit is determined by its neighbors according to a random complex network
structure. In order to treat this problem in an analytical way, we use a
heterogeneous mean-field approximation yielding a set of equations general
valid for uncorrelated random networks. Based on this derivation we focus on
random binary networks where the network is solely comprised of nodes with
either of two degrees. The ratio between the two degrees is shown to be a
crucial parameter. Dependent on the composition of the network the steady
states show the usual transition from disorder to homogeneous ordered
bistability as well as new scenarios that include inhomogeneous ordered and
disordered bistability as well as tristability. The various steady states
differ in their spiking activity expressed by a state dependent spiking rate.
Numerical simulations agree with analytic results of the heterogeneous
mean-field approximation.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and for the effective use of crossover. Yet the
dynamics of how diversity emerges in populations are not well understood. We
use rigorous runtime analysis to gain insight into population dynamics and GA
performance for the ($\mu$+1) GA and the $\text{Jump}_k$ test function. We show
that the interplay of crossover and mutation may serve as a catalyst leading to
a sudden burst of diversity. This leads to improvements of the expected
optimisation time of order $\Omega(n/\log n)$ compared to mutation-only
algorithms like (1+1) EA. Moreover, increasing the mutation rate by an
arbitrarily small constant factor can facilitate the generation of diversity,
leading to speedups of order $\Omega(n)$. We also compare seven commonly used
diversity mechanisms and evaluate their impact on runtime bounds for the
($\mu$+1) GA. All previous results in this context only hold for
unrealistically low crossover probability $p_c=O(k/n)$, while we give analyses
for the setting of constant $p_c < 1$ in all but one case.
  For the typical case of constant $k > 2$ and constant $p_c$, we can compare
the resulting expected runtimes for different diversity mechanisms assuming an
optimal choice of $\mu$: $O(n^{k-1})$ for duplicate elimination/minim.,
$O(n^2\log n)$ for maximising the convex hull, $O(n\log n)$ for deterministic
crowding (assuming $p_c = k/n$), $O(n\log n)$ for maximising Hamming distance,
$O(n\log n)$ for fitness sharing, $O(n\log n)$ for single-receiver island
model.
  This proves a sizeable advantage of all variants of the ($\mu$+1) GA compared
to (1+1) EA, which requires time $\Theta(n^k)$. Experiments complement our
theoretical findings and further highlight the benefits of crossover and
diversity on $\text{Jump}_k$.

color-magnitude diagram of NGC 2808 is the triple main sequence (MS), with the
red MS corresponding to a stellar population with primordial helium, and the
middle and the blue MS being enhanced in helium up to Y$\sim$0.32 and
$\sim$0.38, respectively. A recent study has revealed that this massive cluster
hosts at least five distinct stellar populations (A, B, C, D, and E). Among
them populations A, B, and C correspond to the red MS, while populations C and
D are connected to the middle and the blue MS. In this paper we exploit
Hubble-Space-Telescope photometry to investigate the radial distribution of the

MSs is different. In particular, as predicted from multiple-population
formation models, both the blue MS and the middle MS appears to be more
concentrated than the red MS with a significance level for this result wich is

spectroscopy of trapped deuterated molecular hydrogen ions (HD$^+$), even at
the millikelvin temperatures achieved through sympathetic cooling by
laser-cooled beryllium ions. Recently, Biesheuvel \textit{et al.}
\cite{Biesheuvel2016} presented a theoretical lineshape model for such
transitions which not only considers linestrengths and Doppler broadening, but
also the finite sample size and population redistribution by blackbody
radiation, which are important in view of the long storage and probe times
achievable in ion traps. Here, we employ the rate equation model developed by
Biesheuvel \textit{et al.} to theoretically study the Doppler-broadened
hyperfine structure of the $(v,L):(0,3)\rightarrow(4,2)$ rovibrational
transition in HD$^+$ at 1442~nm. We observe prominent yet hitherto unrecognized
ghost features in the simulated spectrum, whose positions depend on the Doppler
width, transition rates, and saturation levels of the hyperfine components
addressed by the laser. We explain the origin and behavior of such features,
and we provide a simple quantitative guideline to assess whether ghost features
may appear. As such ghost features may be common to saturated Doppler-broadened
spectra of rotational and vibrational transitions in trapped ions composed of
partly overlapping lines, our work illustrates the necessity to use lineshape
models that take into account all the relevant physics.

the Einstein equations for the exterior static gravitational field of an
isolated non-rotating star in a spatially finite universe having the topology
of a flat 3-torus. Since the method of images leads to a divergent Poincare'
series, one needs a regularization which we achieve by using the Appell
respectively the Epstein zeta function. The solution depends on a new positive
constant which is completely fixed by the mass of the star and the spatial
volume of the universe. The physical interpretation is that a stable or
metastable equilibrium requires a topological dark energy which fills the whole
universe with positive energy density and negative pressure. The properties of
the gravitational field are discussed in detail. In particular, its anisotropy
is made explicit by deriving an exact multipole expansion which shows that in
this case Birkhoff's theorem does not hold. While the monopole describes the
Newtonian potential, there is no dipole but always a non-vanishing quadrupole
which leads to a repulsive force experienced by a planet at rest. Finally, we
put forward the conjecture that black holes exist in a toroidal universe and
that their gravitational field is in the weak-field limit well approximated by
the first-order field.

The gene is evolved until the network forms a shear band across the protein,

evolution reduces the high-dimensional sequence space to a low-dimensional
space of mechanical modes, in accord with the observed dimensional reduction
between genotype and phenotype of proteins. Spectral analysis of the space of

delivery time and fluence map matching quality for volumetric modulated arc
therapy (VMAT). At the heart of our method lies a mathematical programming
model that, for a given duration of delivery, optimizes leaf trajectories and
dose rates such that the desired fluence map is reproduced as well as possible.
This model was presented for the single map case in a companion paper (Fast
approximate delivery of fluence maps: the single map case). The resulting
large-scale, non-convex optimization problem was solved using a heuristic
approach. The single-map approach cannot directly be applied to the full arc
case due to the large increase in model size, the issue of allocating delivery
times to each of the arc segments, and the fact that the ending leaf positions
for one map will be the starting leaf positions for the next map. In this
article the method proposed in \cite{dm1} is extended to solve the full map
treatment planning problem. We test our method using a prostate case and a head
and neck case, and present the resulting trade-off curves. Analysis of the leaf
trajectories reveal that short time plans have larger leaf openings in general
than longer delivery time plans. Our method allows one to explore the continuum
of possibilities between coarse, large segment plans characteristic of direct
aperture approaches and narrow field plans produced by sliding window
approaches. Exposing this trade off will allow for an informed choice between
plan quality and solution time. Further research is required to speed up the
optimization process to make this method clinically implementable.

converses for finite blocklength lossy joint source-channel coding problems.
The framework applies for any loss criterion, generalizes certain previously
known converses, and also extends to multi-terminal settings. The finite
blocklength problem is posed equivalently as a nonconvex optimization problem
and using a lift-and-project-like method, a close but tractable LP relaxation
of this problem is derived. Lower bounds on the original problem are obtained
by the construction of feasible points for the dual of the LP relaxation. A
particular application of this approach leads to new converses which recover
and improve on the converses of Kostina and Verdu for finite blocklength lossy
joint source-channel coding and lossy source coding. For finite blocklength
channel coding, the LP relaxation recovers the converse of Polyanskiy, Poor and
Verdu and leads to a new improvement on the converse of Wolfowitz, showing
thereby that our LP relaxation is asymptotically tight with increasing
blocklengths for channel coding, lossless source coding and joint
source-channel coding with the excess distortion probability as the loss
criterion. Using a duality based argument, a new converse is derived for finite
blocklength joint source-channel coding for a class of source-channel pairs.
Employing this converse, the LP relaxation is also shown to be tight for all
blocklengths for the minimization of the expected average symbol-wise Hamming
distortion of a $q$-ary uniform source over a $q$-ary symmetric memoryless
channel for any $q \in N$. The optimization formulation and the
lift-and-project method are extended to networked settings and demonstrated by
obtaining an improvement on a converse of Zhou et al. for the successive
refinement problem for successively refinable source-distortion measure
triplets.

However, the classical synthesis filters are replaced with interpolation

users (MUs) in exchange for some bandwidth from the MC. Our goal is to maximize
the system energy efficiency (EE) of the SC while guaranteeing the quality of
service of each MU as well as small cell users (SUs). Specifically, given the
minimum data rate requirement and the bandwidth provided by the MC, the SC
jointly optimizes MU selection, bandwidth allocation, and power allocation
while guaranteeing its own minimum required system data rate. The problem is
challenging due to the binary MU selection variables and the fractional- form
objective function. We first show that the bandwidth of an MU is shared with at
most one SU in the SC. Then, for a given MU selection, the optimal bandwidth
and power allocation is obtained by exploiting the fractional programming. To
perform MU selection, we first introduce the concept of the trading EE to
characterize the data rate obtained as well as the power consumed for serving
an MU. We then reveal a sufficient and necessary condition for serving an MU
without considering the total power constraint and the minimum data rate
constraint: the trading EE of the MU should be higher than the system EE of the
SC. Based on this insight, we propose a low complexity MU selection method and
also investigate the optimality condition. Simulation results verify our
theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation
achieves near-optimal performance.

microscopic event related to ductile fracture and corresponds to a localized
plastic flow between adjacent voids. Macroscopic load associated to the onset
of coalescence is classically estimated based on limit analysis. However, a
rigorous upper-bound mathematical expression for the limitload required for
flat voids coalescence that remains finite for penny-shaped voids/cracks is
still unavailable. Therefore, based on limit analysis, theoretical upper-bound
estimates - both integral expression and closed-form formula - are obtained for
the limit-load of cylindrical flat voids in cylindrical unit-cell subjected to
boundary conditions allowing the assessment of coalescence, for axisymmetric
stress state. These estimates, leading to finite limit-loads for pennyshaped
cracks, are shown to be in very good agreement with numerical limit analysis,
for both cylindrical and spheroidal voids. Approximate formula is also given
for coalescence under combined tension and shear loading. These coalescence
criteria can thus be used to predict onset of coalescence of voids by internal
necking in ductile fracture modelling.

systematically study the relationship of DSCs with GCs, and their host galaxy

hosts either having low mass or showing clear disk components. We find that
while the number ratio of DSCs to GCs is nearly constant in massive galaxies,
the DSC-to-GC ratio becomes systematically higher in lower mass hosts. This
suggests that DSCs may be more efficient at forming (or surviving) in low
density environments. DSC hosts are not special either in their position in the
cluster, or in the galactic color-magnitude diagram. Why some disk and low-mass
galaxies host DSCs while others do not is still a puzzle, however. The mean
ages of DSC hosts and non-hosts are similar at similar masses, implying that
formation efficiency, rather than survival, is the reason behind different DSC
number fractions in early-type galaxies.

condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics for several decades. A
phenomenological aspect that makes glass formation a conceptually formidable
problem is that structural and dynamic correlations in glass-forming liquids
are too subtle to be captured at the level of conventional two-point functions.
As a consequence, a host of theoretical techniques, such as quenched amorphous
configurations of particles, have been devised and employed in simulations and
colloid experiments to gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for these
elusive correlations. Very often, though, the analysis of spatio-temporal
correlations is performed in the context of a single theoretical framework, and
critical comparisons of microscopic predictions of competing theories are
thereby lacking. Here, we address this issue by analysing the distribution of
localized excitations, which are building blocks of relaxation as per the
Dynamical Facilitation (DF) theory, in the presence of an amorphous wall, a
construct motivated by the Random First-Order Transition theory (RFOT). We
observe that spatial profiles of the concentration of excitations exhibit
complex features such as non-monotonicity and oscillations. Moreover, the
smoothly varying part of the concentration profile yields a length scale
$\xi_c$, which we compare with a previously computed length scale $\xi_{dyn}$.
Our results suggest a method to assess the role of dynamical facilitation in
governing structural relaxation in glass-forming liquids.

is almost surely difference-dominated as $n \to \infty$, but for slowly
decaying $p(n)$, $A$ is almost surely balanced as $n \to \infty$, with a
continuous phase transition as $p(n)$ crosses a critical threshold.
Specifically, we show that if $p(n) = o(n^{-1/2})$, then $|A-A|/|A+A|$
converges to $2$ almost surely as $n \to \infty$ and if $p(n) = c \cdot
n^{-1/2}$, then $|A-A|/|A+A|$ converges to $1+\exp(-c^2/2)$ almost surely as $n

n^{-1/2} = o(p(n))$, we prove that $|A-A| = |A+A| = n$ almost surely as $n \to

behavior is drastically different from that of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ and new
technical issues arise, so a novel approach is needed. When $n^{-1/2} =

subsets of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ approaches the behavior of subsets of

For
the most familiar case-water vapor in Earth's present climate-the condensible

to the noncondensible background gases. A wide variety of important planetary
climate problems involve nondilute condensible substances. These include
planets near or undergoing a water vapor runaway and planets near the outer
edge of the conventional habitable zone, for which CO2 is the condensible.
Standard representations of convection in climate models rely on several
approximations appropriate only to the dilute limit, while nondilute convection
differs in fundamental ways from dilute convection. In this paper, a simple
parameterization of convection valid in the nondilute as well as dilute limits
is derived and used to discuss the basic character of nondilute convection. The
energy conservation properties of the scheme are discussed in detail and are
verified in radiative-convective simulations. As a further illustration of the
behavior of the scheme, results for a runaway greenhouse atmosphere for both
steady instellation and seasonally varying instellation corresponding to a
highly eccentric orbit are presented. The latter case illustrates that the high
thermal inertia associated with latent heat in nondilute atmospheres can damp
out the effects of even extreme seasonal forcing.

includes:
  -- We present a $poly(\log n)$ round deterministic algorithm for
$(2\Delta-1)\cdot (1+o(1))$-edge-coloring, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum
degree. Modulo the $1+o(1)$ factor, this settles one of the long-standing open

\Delta)$-edge-coloring in $poly(\log n)$ rounds was asked for in the 4th open
question in the Distributed Graph Coloring book by Barenboim and Elkin.
  -- We show that sinkless orientation---i.e., orienting edges such that each
node has at least one outgoing edge---on $\Delta$-regular graphs can be solved
in $O(\log_{\Delta} \log n)$ rounds randomized and in $O(\log_{\Delta} n)$
rounds deterministically. These prove the corresponding lower bounds by Brandt
et al. [STOC'16] and Chang, Kopelowitz, and Pettie [FOCS'16] to be tight.
Moreover, these show that sinkless orientation exhibits an exponential
separation between its randomized and deterministic complexities, akin to the
results of Chang et al. for $\Delta$-coloring $\Delta$-regular trees.
  -- We present a randomized $O(\log^4 n)$ round algorithm for orienting

turned into a decomposition into $a (1+\epsilon)$ forests when $a=\Omega(\log

efficient distributed decomposition into less than $2a$ forests was stated as

oscillators are common place objects and, wherever encountered, are
analytically solvable. Elementary particles, on the other hand, are abstract
entities far from one's reach. Understanding of one may help a better
appreciation of the other.

  Together, Classes of Regions, Duality, and Parallel Fibre Bundles","27 pages, 15 figures",,,,"math.GN math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces two proximal forms of Lenzen physical geometry, namely,
an \emph{axiomatized strongly proximal physical geometry} that is built on
simplicial complexes with the dualities and sewing operations derived from
string geometry and an \emph{axiomatized descriptive proximal physical
geometry} in which spatial regions are described based on their features and
the descriptive proximities between regions. This is a computational proximity
approach to a Lenzen geometry of physical space. In both forms of physical
geometry, region is a primitive. Intuitively, a region is a set of connected
subregions. The primitive in this geometry is \emph{region}, instead of
\emph{point}. Each description of a region with $n$ features is a mapping from
the region to a feature vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the feature space,
proximal physical geometry has the look and feel of either Euclidean,
Riemannian, or non-Euclidean geometry, since we freely work with the relations
between points in the feature space. The focus in these new forms of geometry
is the relation between individual regions with their own distinctive features
such as shape, area, perimeter and diameter and the relation between nonempty
sets of regions. The axioms for physical geometry as well as the axioms for
proximal physical geometry are given and illustrated. Results for parallel
classes of regions, descriptive fibre bundles and BreMiller-Sloyer sheaves are
given. In addition, a region-based Borsuk-Ulam Theorem as well as a Wired
Friend Theorem are given in the context of both forms of physical geometry.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a critical component of this response.
Nanovesicular exosomes play a role in immunity, but to date their exact
contribution to the dissemination of the TLR response is unknown. Here we show
that exosomes from TLR stimulated cells (TLR-exosomes) can largely recapitulate
TLR activation in distal cells in vitro. We can abrogate the
action-at-a-distance signaling of exosomes by UV irradiation, demonstrating
that RNA is crucial for their effector function. We are the first to show that
exosomes derived from poly(I:C) stimulated cells induce in vivo macrophage
M1-like polarization within murine lymph nodes. These TLR-exosomes demonstrate
enhanced trafficking to the node and preferentially recruit neutrophils as
compared to control-exosomes. This work definitively establishes the
differential effector function for TLR-exosomes in communicating the activation
state of the cell of origin.

orbit determination capabilities for near Earth satellites. The gravity
gradients contain useful position information which can be extracted by
matching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman
filter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of
orbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are
discussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to
deal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to
analyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights,
attitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show
that the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors.
Degraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented
state filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are used to test the
algorithm. Radial and cross-track position errors of less than 100 m have been
achieved.

  Data",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of classifying the transmission system
when it is not known a priori whether the transmission is via a single antenna
or multiple antennas. The receiver is assumed to be employed with a known
number of antennas. In a data frame transmitted by most multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) systems, some pilot or training data is inserted for symbol
timing synchronization and estimation of the channel. Our goal is to perform
MIMO transmit antenna classification using this pilot data. More specifically,
the problem of determining the transmission system is cast as a multiple
hypothesis testing problem where the number of hypotheses is equal to the
maximum number of transmit antennas. Under the assumption of receiver having
the exact knowledge of pilot data used for timing synchronization and channel
estimation, we consider maximum likelihood (ML) and correlation test statistics
to classify the MIMO transmit system. When only probabilistic knowledge of
pilot data is available at the receiver, a hybrid-maximum likelihood (HML)
based test statistic is constructed using the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated via
simulations and comparative merits of different techniques in terms of the
computational complexity and performance are discussed.
