there exists a suitable approximate identity. We say an operator is 'locally
bounded' if the composition of the operator with each element in the
approximate identity is bounded. We prove that the perturbation of a regular
self-adjoint operator by a locally bounded symmetric operator is again regular
and self-adjoint. We use this result to show that the Kasparov class
represented by an unbounded Kasparov module is stable under locally bounded
perturbations. As an application, we show that we obtain a converse to the
'doubling up' procedure of odd unbounded Kasparov modules. Finally, we discuss
perturbations of unbounded Kasparov modules by unbounded multipliers. In
particular, we explicitly construct an unbounded multiplier such that (after
doubling up the module) the perturbed operator has compact resolvent.

detailed information on dynamics of carriers in a correlated electron material
from its optical conductivity, $\sigma(\Omega, T)$. This review consists of
three parts, addressing the following three aspects of optical response: 1) the
role of momentum relaxation, 2) $\Omega/T$ scaling of the optical conductivity
of a Fermi-liquid metal, and 3) optical conductivity of non-Fermi-liquid
metals. In the first part (Sec. II), we analyze the interplay between the
contributions to the conductivity from normal and umklapp scattering. In the
second part (Secs. III and IV), we re-visit the Gurzhi formula for the optical
scattering rate, $1/\tau(\Omega,T)\propto\Omega^2+4\pi^2 T^2$, and show that a
factor of $4\pi^2$ is the manifestation of the ""first-Matsubara-frequency
rule"", which states that $1/\tau(\Omega,T)$ must vanish upon analytic
continuation to the first boson Matsubara frequency. However, recent
experiments show that the coefficient $b$ in the Gurzhi-like form,
$1/\tau(\Omega,T)\propto\Omega^2+b\pi^2 T^2$, differs significantly from $b=4$
in most of the cases. We suggest that the discrepancy may be due to the
presence of elastic scattering, which decreases the value of $b$ below $4$,
with $b=1$ corresponding to purely elastic scattering. In the third part (Sec.
V), we consider the optical conductivity of metals near quantum phase
transitions to nematic and spin-density-wave (SDW) states. In the last case, we
focus on ""composite"" scattering processes, which give rise to a
non-Fermi--liquid behavior of the optical conductivity:
$\sigma'(\Omega,T)\propto \Omega^{-1/3}$ at low frequencies and
$\sigma'(\Omega,T)\propto \Omega^{-1}$ at higher frequencies. We also discuss
$\Omega/T$ scaling and show that $\sigma'(\Omega,T)$ in the same model scales
in a non-Fermi-liquid way, as $T^{4/3}\Omega^{-5/3}$.

atoms. They can, e.g., be realized with strongly focused trapping light beams
or the optical near fields of nano-scale waveguides and photonic
nanostructures. Atoms in such traps often experience strongly spatially varying
AC Stark shifts which are proportional to the magnetic quantum number of the
respective energy level. These inhomogeneous fictitious magnetic fields can
cause a displacement of the trapping potential that depends on the Zeeman
state. Hitherto, this effect was mainly perceived as detrimental. However, it
also provides a means to probe and to manipulate the motional state of the
atoms in the trap by driving transitions between Zeeman states. Furthermore, by
applying additional real or fictitious magnetic fields, the state-dependence of
the trapping potential can be controlled. Here, using laser-cooled atoms that
are confined in a nanofiber-based optical dipole trap, we employ this control
in order to tune the microwave coupling of motional quantum states. We record
corresponding microwave spectra which allow us to infer the trap parameters as
well as the temperature of the atoms. Finally, we reduce the mean number of
motional quanta in one spatial dimension to $\langle n\rangle=0.3 \pm 0.1$ by
microwave sideband cooling. Our work shows that the inherent fictitious
magnetic fields in optical microtraps expand the experimental toolbox for
interrogating and manipulating cold atoms.

background in several channels for the search of new Physics at the LHC,
requires the knowledge of double parton distribution functions (dPDFs). These
quantities represent also a novel tool for the study of the three-dimensional
nucleon structure, complementary to the possibilities offered by
electromagnetic probes. In this paper we analyze dPDFs using Poincar\'e
covariant predictions obtained by using a Light-Front constituent quark model
proposed in a recent paper, and QCD evolution. We study to what extent
factorized expressions for dPDFs, which neglect, at least in part, two-parton
correlations, can be used. We show that they fail in reproducing the calculated
dPDFs, in particular in the valence region. Actually measurable processes at
existing facilities occur at low longitudinal momenta of the interacting
partons; to have contact with these processes we have analyzed correlations
between pairs of partons of different kind, finding that, in some cases, they
are strongly suppressed at low longitudinal momenta, while for other
distributions they can be sizeable. For example, the effect of gluon-gluon
correlations can be as large as 20 $\%$. We have shown that these behaviors can
be understood in terms of a delicate interference of non-perturbative
correlations, generated by the dynamics of the model, and perturbative ones,
generated by the model independent evolution procedure. Our analysis shows that
at LHC kinematics two-parton correlations can be relevant in DPS, and therefore
we address the possibility to study them experimentally.

magnetic torque. In turn, the evolution of the magnetic field is determined by
dynamical processes and non-ideal MHD effects such as ambipolar diffusion.
Considering simple relations between various timescales characteristic of the
magnetized collapse, we derive an expression for the early disc radius, $ r
\simeq 18 \, {\rm AU} \, \left({\eta_{\rm AD} / 0.1 \, {\rm s}} \right)^{2/9}

the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and $B_z$ is the magnetic field in the
inner part of the core. This is about significantly smaller than the discs that
would form if angular momentum was conserved.
  The analytical predictions are confronted against a large sample of 3D,
non-ideal MHD collapse calculations covering variations of a factor 100 in core
mass, a factor 10 in the level of turbulence, a factor 5 in rotation, and
magnetic mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux ratios 2 and 5. The disc
radius estimates are found to agree with the numerical simulations within less

  A striking prediction of our analysis is the weak dependence of circumstellar

$D\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ thresholds, there are two quark model
bare states, i.e. the $\psi(3770)$ and $\psi(4040)$, which are assigned as

positions of the $\psi(3770)$ and $\psi(4040)$. The deviation of the ratios
from that in the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) limit reflects the HQSS
breaking effect due to the mass splitting between the $D$ and the $D^*$.

nanoribbons in particular, is limited by the strength of line-edge-roughness
scattering. One way to characterize the roughness strength is the dependency of
the thermal conductivity on the channel width in the form W^{\beta}. Although
in the case of electronic transport this dependency is very well studied,
resulting in W^6 for nanowires and quantum wells and W^4 for nanoribbons, in
the case of phonon transport it is not yet clear what this dependence is. In
this work, using lattice dynamics and Non-Equilibrium Greens Function
simulations, we examine the width dependence of the thermal conductivity of
ultra-narrow graphene nanoribbons under the influence of line edge-roughness.
We show that the exponent {\beta} is in fact not a single well-defined number,
but it is different for different parts of the phonon spectrum depending on
whether phonon transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized. The exponent
{\beta} takes values {\beta} < 1 for semi-ballistic phonon transport, values
{\beta} >> than 1 for sub-diffusive or localized phonons, and {\beta} = 1 only
in the case where the transport is diffusive. The overall W^{\beta} dependence
of the thermal conductivity is determined by the width-dependence of the
dominant phonon modes (usually the acoustic ones). We show that due to the long
phonon mean-free-paths, the width-dependence of thermal conductivity becomes a
channel length dependent property, because the channel length determines
whether transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized.

performed using an asymptotic quasi-geostrophic model that incorporates the
effects of no-slip boundaries through (i) parameterized Ekman pumping boundary
conditions, and (ii) a thermal wind boundary layer that regularizes the
enhanced thermal fluctuations induced by pumping. The fidelity of the model,
obtained by an asymptotic reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations that
implicitly enforces a pointwise geostrophic balance, is explored for the first
time by comparisons of simulations against the findings of direct numerical
simulations and laboratory experiments. Results from these methods have
established Ekman pumping as the mechanism responsible for significantly
enhancing the vertical heat transport. This asymptotic model demonstrates
excellent agreement over a range of thermal forcing for Pr ~1 when compared
with results from experiments and DNS at maximal values of their attainable
rotation rates, as measured by the Ekman number (E ~ 10^{-7}); good qualitative
agreement is achieved for Pr > 1. Similar to studies with stress-free
boundaries, four spatially distinct flow morphologies exists. Despite the
presence of frictional drag at the upper and/or lower boundaries, a strong
non-local inverse cascade of barotropic (i.e., depth-independent) kinetic
energy persists in the final regime of geostrophic turbulence and is dominant
at large scales. For mixed no-slip/stress-free and no-slip/no-slip boundaries,
Ekman friction is found to attenuate the efficiency of the upscale energy
transport and, unlike the case of stress-free boundaries, rapidly saturates the
barotropic kinetic energy. For no-slip/no-slip boundaries, Ekman friction is
strong enough to prevent the development of a coherent dipole vortex
condensate. Instead vortex pairs are found to be intermittent, varying in both
time and strength.

and noisy random linear measurements. In the noiseless scenario, it is shown
that when the coefficients are samples from a Gaussian distribution, AOLS with
high probability recovers a $k$-sparse $m$-dimensional sparse vector using
${\cal O}(k\log \frac{m}{k+L-1})$ measurements. Similar result is established
for the bounded-noise scenario where an additional condition on the smallest
nonzero element of the unknown vector is required. The asymptotic sampling
complexity of AOLS is lower than the asymptotic sampling complexity of the
existing sparse reconstruction algorithms. In simulations, AOLS is compared to
state-of-the-art sparse recovery techniques and shown to provide better
performance in terms of accuracy, running time, or both. Finally, we consider
an application of AOLS to clustering high-dimensional data lying on the union
of low-dimensional subspaces and demonstrate its superiority over existing
methods.

horizontal, have been observed during many flares. Previous interpretations
include coronal loops that contract and it has been speculated that such jerks
could be responsible for sunquakes. Here we report the detection of stepwise
chromospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B$_{\rm LOS}$) changes obtained
through spectropolarimetry of Ca II 8542 \AA\ with DST/IBIS during the X1-flare
SOL20140329T17:48. They are stronger ($<$640 Mx cm$^{-2}$) and appear in larger
areas than their photospheric counterparts ($<$320 Mx cm$^{-2}$). The absolute
value of B$_{\rm LOS}$ more often decreases than increases. Photospheric
changes are predominantly located near a polarity inversion line, chromospheric
changes near footpoints of loops. The locations of changes are near, but not
exactly co-spatial to hard X-ray (HXR) emission and neither to enhanced
continuum emission, nor a small sunquake. Enhanced chromospheric and coronal
emission is observed in nearly all locations that exhibit changes of B$_{\rm
LOS}$, but the emission also occurs in many locations without any B$_{\rm LOS}$
changes. Photospheric and chromospheric changes of B$_{\rm LOS}$ show
differences in timing, sign, and size and seem independent of each other. A
simple model of contracting loops yields changes of opposite sign to those
observed. An explanation for this discrepancy could be increasing loop sizes or
loops that untwist in a certain direction during the flare. It is yet unclear
which processes are responsible for the observed changes, their timing, size
and locations, especially considering the incoherence between photosphere and
chromosphere.

increasingly difficult task. Most code search engines are based on syntactic
techniques such as signature matching or keyword extraction. However, these
techniques are inaccurate (because they basically rely on documentation) and at
the same time do not offer very expressive code query languages. We propose a
novel approach that focuses on querying for semantic characteristics of code
obtained automatically from the code itself. Program units are pre-processed
using static analysis techniques, based on abstract interpretation, obtaining
safe semantic approximations. A novel, assertion-based code query language is
used to express desired semantic characteristics of the code as partial
specifications. Relevant code is found by comparing such partial specifications
with the inferred semantics for program elements. Our approach is fully
automatic and does not rely on user annotations or documentation. It is more
powerful and flexible than signature matching because it is parametric on the
abstract domain and properties, and does not require type definitions. Also, it
reasons with relations between properties, such as implication and abstraction,
rather than just equality. It is also more resilient to syntactic code
differences. We describe the approach and report on a prototype implementation

This novel connection relies on a recent realization of tree-level

theory with Z-theory --- the collection of putative scalar effective field
theories encoding all the alpha'-dependence of the open superstring. Here we
identify the color-ordered amplitudes of the NLSM as the low-energy limit of
abelian Z-theory. This realization also provides natural higher-derivative
corrections to the NLSM amplitudes arising from higher powers of alpha' in the
abelian Z-theory amplitudes, and through double copy also to Born-Infeld and
Volkov-Akulov theories. The Kleiss-Kuijf and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations
obeyed by Z-theory amplitudes thereby apply to all alpha'-corrections of the

our perceptions of nonlinear optical processes that have been explored since
the invention of lasers. For example, the ability to control optical field
confinement, enhancement, and scattering almost independently, allows nonlinear
frequency conversion efficiencies to be enhanced by many orders of magnitude
compared to bulk materials. Also, the subwavelength length scale renders phase
matching issues irrelevant. Compared with plasmonic nanostructures, dielectric
resonator metamaterials show great promise for enhanced nonlinear optical
processes due to their larger mode volumes. Here, we present, for the first
time, resonantly enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) using Gallium
Arsenide (GaAs) based dielectric metasurfaces. Using arrays of cylindrical
resonators we observe SHG enhancement factors as large as 104 relative to
unpatterned GaAs. At the magnetic dipole resonance we measure an absolute
nonlinear conversion efficiency of ~2X10^(-5) with ~3.4 GW/cm2 pump intensity.
The polarization properties of the SHG reveal that both bulk and surface
nonlinearities play important roles in the observed nonlinear process.

solutocapillary Marangoni flow, which propels the droplet. We model the system

previous work, we illustrate the coarsening dynamics of the surfactant mixture
towards phase separation in the axisymmetric swimming state. Coarsening
proceeds in two steps: an initially slow growth of domain size followed by a
nearly ballistic regime. On larger time scales thermal fluctuations in the
local surfactant composition initiates random changes in the swimming direction
and the droplet performs a persistent random walk, as observed in experiments.
Numerical solutions show that the rotational correlation time scales with the
square of the inverse noise strength. We confirm this scaling by a perturbation
theory for the fluctuations in the mixture order parameter and thereby identify
the active emulsion droplet as an active Brownian particle.

Astrophysical observables, however, depend strongly on the star's internal

that do not depend sensitively on the star's internal structure. One such set
of relations is between the star's moment of inertia ($I$), its tidal Love

resemble the well-known black hole no-hair theorems. Universal relations break
degeneracies among astrophysical observables, leading to a variety of
applications: (i) X-ray measurements of the nuclear matter equation of state,
(ii) gravitational wave measurements of the intrinsic spin of inspiraling

[X/H] = -1. The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 +/- 8)% of the pLLSs and is
centered at [X/H] ~ -1.87 (1.3% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity
peak is centered at [X/H] ~ -0.32 (48% solar metallicity). Although the sample
of LLSs is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity
distributions of the LLSs and pLLSs are different, with a far lower fraction of
very metal-poor ([X/H] < -1.4) LLSs than pLLSs. The fraction of LLSs with [X/H]
< -1 is similar to that found in pLLSs (~56%). However, higher H I column
density absorbers (log N(H I) > 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor
gas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies
depends sensitively on N(H I) at z < 1. We interpret the high-metallicity
([X/H] > -1) pLLSs and LLSs as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and
tidally-stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity pLLSs and LLSs imply
that the CGM of z < 1 galaxies is also host to a substantial mass of cool,
dense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.

mediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They
can have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer
catastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum
and energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive
galactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the
details of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR
transport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)
and as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we
compare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised
three-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result
in significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star
formation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses
$M\approx10^{10}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more
than ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We
demonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\'en waves during
the CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the
thermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion
conserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are
efficiently scattered by Alfv\'en waves that are propagating up the CR
gradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,
but not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical
evolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant
diffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes.

metallicity distribution of the pLLSs/LLSs at 2.3<z<3.3 is consistent with a
unimodal distribution peaking at [X/H]=-2. The metallicity distribution of
these absorbers therefore evolves markedly with z since at z<1 it is bimodal

systems, our understanding is mostly limited to bipartite situations. Indeed,
even defining appropriate notions of multipartite entanglement is a significant
challenge for general quantum systems. In this work, we initiate the study of
multipartite entanglement in a rich, yet tractable class of quantum states
called stabilizer tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for generic stabilizer
tensor networks, the geometry of the tensor network informs the multipartite
entanglement structure of the state. In particular, we show that the average
number of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) triples that can be extracted from
a stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that tripartite entanglement is
scarce. This, in turn, restricts the higher-partite entanglement structure of
the states. Recent research in quantum gravity found that stabilizer tensor
networks reproduce important structural features of the AdS/CFT correspondence,
including the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy and certain
quantum error correction properties. Our results imply a new operational
interpretation of the monogamy of the Ryu-Takayanagi mutual information and an
entropic diagnostic for higher-partite entanglement. Our technical
contributions include a spin model for evaluating the average GHZ content of
stabilizer tensor networks, as well as a novel formula for the third moment of

methods of converting observed magnitudes to flux densities are not very
accurate when applied to UV photometry. Common methods for extinction and the
integration of pseudo-bolometric fluxes can also lead to inaccurate results.
The sources of inaccuracy, though, also apply to other wavelengths. Because of
the complicated nature of translating broad-band photometry into monochromatic
flux densities, comparison between observed photometry and a spectroscopic
model is best done by comparing in the natural units of the observations. We
recommend that integrated flux measurements be made using a spectrum or
spectral energy distribution which is consistent with the multi-band photometry
rather than converting individual photometric measurements to flux densities,
linearly interpolating between the points, and integrating. We also highlight
some specific areas where the UV flux can be mischaracterized.

approximate symmetry operators---unitary operators whose commutators with the

the degeneracy in the ground space. Our analysis additionally holds for any
gapped band of sufficiently small width in the excited spectrum of the

as measurement of magnetic field strength through the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method and removal of polarized foreground dust emissions for the detection of
inflationary polarized emission in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
However, the physical origin of the alignment remains to be explained. To
understand the alignment mechanism, we examine formation of HI clouds triggered
by shock compression of diffuse warm neutral medium using three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the effects of optically thin cooling and
heating. We show that the shock-compressed diffuse interstellar medium of
density n~1 cm^-3 evolves into HI clouds with typical density n~50 cm^-3 via
thermal instability driven by cooling, which is consistent with previous
studies. We apply a machine vision transformation developed by Clark et
al.(2014) to the resulting column density structures obtained by the
simulations in order to measure angle correlation between filamentary
structures of HI clouds and magnetic field. We find that the orientation of HI
filaments depends on the environmental turbulent velocity field, particularly
on the strength of shear strain in the direction of the magnetic field, which
is controlled by the angle between the shock propagation direction and upstream
magnetic field. When the strain along the magnetic field is weak, filamentary
components of HI clouds basically lie perpendicular to the magnetic field.
However, the filaments have come to align with the magnetic field, if we
enhance the turbulent strain along the magnetic field or if we set turbulence
in the preshock medium.

on the correlation between different measurements of angular diameter, used as
a proxy for atmospheric extension, and fundamental stellar parameters. For a
given star, spectrophotometry measures the Rosseland angular diameter while
interferometric observations generally probe a larger limb-darkened angular
diameter. The ratio of these two angular diameters is proportional to the
relative extension of the stellar atmosphere, which is strongly correlated to
the star's effective temperature, radius and mass. We show that these
correlations are strong and can lead to precise measurements of stellar masses.

controller hardware implementation. This approach leverages the simplicity of
real-time Walsh-function generation in classical digital hardware, and the fact
that a wide variety of physical-layer controls such as dynamic error
suppression are known to fall within the Walsh family. We experimentally
implement a real-time FPGA-based Walsh controller producing Walsh timing
signals and Walsh-synthesized analog waveforms appropriate for critical tasks
in error-resistant quantum control and noise characterization. These
demonstrations represent the first step towards a unified framework for the
realization of physical-layer controls compatible with large-scale quantum
information processing.

to parity.
  We show, that in the case of the cascade decays of tau to a1 nu, information
on the CP state of Higgs can be extracted from the acoplanarity angles as well.
Because in the cascade decay a1^+- to rho^0 pi^pm,rho^0 to pi^+ pi^- up to four
planes can be defined, up to 16 distinct acoplanarity angles are available for
H \to tau tau to a1^+ a1^- nu nu decays. These acoplanarities carry in part
supplementary but also correlated information. It is thus cumbersome to
evaluate an overall sensitivity.
  We investigate sensitivity potential of such analysis, by developing and
implementing model in the Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We quantify
possible improvements when multi-dimensional phase-space of outgoing decay
products directions is used, instead of 1-dimensional projections i.e. the

components of a database engine, while the assessment of an optimizer's quality
remains a challenging task. Indeed, existing performance benchmarks for
database engines (like TPC benchmarks) produce a performance assessment of the
query runtime system rather than its query optimizer. To address this
challenge, this paper introduces OptMark, a toolkit for evaluating the quality
of a query optimizer. OptMark is designed to offer a number of desirable
properties. First, it decouples the quality of an optimizer from the quality of
its underlying execution engine. Second it evaluates independently both the
effectiveness of an optimizer (i.e., quality of the chosen plans) and its
efficiency (i.e., optimization time). OptMark includes also a generic
benchmarking toolkit that is minimum invasive to the DBMS that wishes to use
it. Any DBMS can provide a system-specific implementation of a simple API that
allows OptMark to run and generate benchmark scores for the specific system.
This paper discusses the metrics we propose for evaluating an optimizer's
quality, the benchmark's design and the toolkit's API and functionality. We
have implemented OptMark on the open-source MySQL engine as well as two
commercial database systems. Using these implementations we are able to assess
the quality of the optimizers on these three systems based on the TPC-DS
benchmark queries.

is assumed to follow a power law of the local stress amplitude, a form which
can be generically justified on the grounds of the approximately self-similar
aspect of microcrack distributions. Our aim is to determine the relation
between model ingredients and the Paris exponent governing subcritical
crack-growth dynamics at the macroscopic scale, starting from a single small
notch propagating along a fixed line. By a series of analytical and numerical
calculations, we show that, in the absence of disorder, there is a critical
damage-accumulation exponent $\gamma$, namely $\gamma_c=2$, separating two
distinct regimes of behavior for the Paris exponent $m$. For $\gamma>\gamma_c$,
the Paris exponent is shown to assume the value $m=\gamma$, a result which
proves robust against the separate introduction of various modifying
ingredients. Explicitly, we deal here with (i) the requirement of a minimum
stress for damage to occur; (ii) the presence of disorder in local damage
thresholds; (iii) the possibility of crack healing. On the other hand, in the
regime $\gamma<\gamma_c$ the Paris exponent is seen to be sensitive to the
different ingredients added to the model, with rapid healing or a high minimum
stress for damage leading to $m=2$ for all $\gamma<\gamma_c$, in contrast with
the linear dependence $m=6-2\gamma$ observed for very long characteristic
healing times in the absence of a minimum stress for damage. Upon the
introduction of disorder on the local fatigue thresholds, which leads to the
possible appearance of multiple cracks along the propagation line, the Paris
exponent tends to $m\approx 4$ for $\gamma\lesssim 2$, while retaining the
behavior $m=\gamma$ for $\gamma\gtrsim 4$.

detected from galaxies at even higher redshifts. The stacking results place
constraints on the BHAD associated with the known high-redshift galaxy samples,
as well as on the SFRD at high redshift, assuming a range of prescriptions for
X-ray emission due to X- ray binaries. We find that the X-ray emission from our

show that low-rate mass accretion onto SMBHs in individually X-ray-undetected

sound velocity does not increase monotonically, but reaches a maximum at a few
Kelvin and decreases at higher temperatures. Tunneling-two-level-system (TTLS)
model explained the $\ln T$ dependence of sound velocity shift. In TTLS model
the slope ratio of $\ln T$ dependence of sound velocity shift between lower
temperature increasing regime (resonance regime) and higher temperature
decreasing regime (relaxation regime) is $\mathcal{C}^{\rm res

coupled block model to prove the slope ratio of sound velocity shift between
two regimes is $\mathcal{C}^{\rm res }:\mathcal{C}^{\rm rel }=1:-1$ rather than
$1:-\frac{1}{2}$, which agrees with the majority of the measurements. The
dielectric constant shift in low-temperature glasses,
$[\epsilon_r(T)-\epsilon_r(T_0)]/\epsilon_r(T_0)$, has a similar logarithmic
temperature dependence below $10$K: $[\epsilon(T)-\epsilon(T_0)]/\epsilon(T_0)

shift between resonance and relaxation regimes is $\mathcal{C}^{\rm

dipole-dipole interaction, to prove that the slope ratio between two regimes is
$\mathcal{C}^{\rm res}:\mathcal{C}^{\rm rel} = -1:1$ rather than
$-1:\frac{1}{2}$. Our result agrees with the dielectric constant measurements.
By developing a real space renormalization technique for glass non-elastic and

Their evolution is essentially a cooling process that lasts for $\sim 10$ Gyr.
Their observed properties provide information about the history of the Galaxy,
its dark matter content and a host of other interesting astrophysical problems.
Examples of these include an independent determination of the past history of
the local star formation rate, identification of the objects responsible for
the reported microlensing events, constraints on the rate of change of the
gravitational constant, and upper limits to the mass of weakly interacting
massive particles. To carry on these tasks the essential observational tools
are the luminosity and mass functions of white dwarfs, whereas the theoretical
tools are the evolutionary sequences of white dwarf progenitors, and the
corresponding white dwarf cooling sequences. In particular, the observed white
dwarf luminosity function is the key manifestation of the white dwarf cooling
theory, although other relevant ingredients are needed to compare theory and
observations. In this review we summarize the recent attempts to empirically
determine the white dwarf luminosity function for the different Galactic
populations. We also discuss the biases that may affect its interpretation.
Finally, we elaborate on the theoretical ingredients needed to model the white
dwarf luminosity function, paying special attention to the remaining
uncertainties, and we comment on some applications of the white dwarf cooling
theory. Astrophysical problems for which white dwarf stars may provide useful
leverage in the near future are also discussed.

unbalanced Maxwell stresses imposed at the core-crust boundary, and the
coupling of the dynamic crust to the external magnetic field. Stress buildup
and yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion
radiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase
the creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to
be possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal
conduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and
time-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is
developed. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst
timescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant
magnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying
power-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized
sub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust. A one-dimensional model of
stress relaxation in the vertically stratified crust shows that a modest
increase in applied stress allows embedded magnetic shear to escape the star
over $\sim$ 3-10 ms, dissipating greater energy if the exterior field is
already sheared. Several such zones coupled to each other naturally yield a
burst of duration $\sim$ 0.1 s, as is observed over a wide range of burst
energies. The collective interaction of many plastic zones forces an
overstability of global elastic modes of the crust, consistent with QPO
activity extending over $\gtrsim$ 100 s. Giant flares probably involve sudden
meltdown in localized zones, with high-frequency ($\gg$ 100 Hz) QPOs
corresponding to standing Alfv\'en waves within these zones.

system architecture. In particular, anomaly-based IDS has been widely applied
to detect abnormal process behaviors that deviate from the majority. However,
such abnormal behavior usually consists of a series of low-level heterogeneous
events. The gap between the low-level events and the high-level abnormal
behaviors makes it hard to infer which single events are related to the real
abnormal activities, especially considering that there are massive ""noisy""
low-level events happening in between. Hence, the existing work that focus on
detecting single entities/events can hardly achieve high detection accuracy.
Different from previous work, we design and implement GID, an efficient
graph-based intrusion detection technique that can identify abnormal event
sequences from a massive heterogeneous process traces with high accuracy. GID
first builds a compact graph structure to capture the interactions between
different system entities. The suspiciousness or anomaly score of process paths
is then measured by leveraging random walk technique to the constructed acyclic
directed graph. To eliminate the score bias from the path length, the Box-Cox
power transformation based approach is introduced to normalize the anomaly
scores so that the scores of paths of different lengths have the same
distribution. The efficiency of suspicious path discovery is further improved
by the proposed optimization scheme. We fully implement our GID algorithm and
deploy it into a real enterprise security system, and it greatly helps detect
the advanced threats, and optimize the incident response. Executing GID on
system monitoring datasets showing that GID is efficient (about 2 million
records per minute) and accurate (higher than 80% in terms of detection rate).

discovering images through spatial queries. The heart of the KOA service is an
R-tree-based, database-indexing mechanism prototyped by the Virtual

Mosaic project, designed to provide fast access to large imaging data sets as a
first step in creating wide-area image mosaics. The KOA service uses the
results of the spatial R-tree search to create an SQLite data database for
further relational filtering. The service uses a JSON configuration file to
describe the association between instrument parameters and the service query
parameters, and to make it applicable beyond the Keck instruments.
  The R-tree program was itself extended to support temporal (in addition to
spatial) indexing, in response to requests from the planetary science community
for a search engine to discover observations of Solar System objects. With this
3D-indexing scheme, the service performs very fast time and spatial matches
between the target ephemerides, obtained from the JPL SPICE service. Our
experiments indicate these matches can be more than 100 times faster than when
separating temporal and spatial searches. Images of the tracks of the moving
targets, overlaid with the image footprints, are computed with a new

using latest theoretical models corrected for confounding factors and optimized
for signal to noise ratio. Theory and Methods: The improvement of the
performance of state of the art MRI relaxometry algorithms is challenging
because of a non-negligible bias and still unresolved numerical instabilities.
Here, R2* mapping reconstructions, including complex-fitting with
multi-spectral fat-correction by using single-decay (1D) and double-decay (2D)
formulation, are studied in order to identify optimal configuration parameters
and minimize numerical artifacts. The effects of echo number, echo spacing, and
fat/water relaxation model are evaluated through simulated and in-vivo data. We
also explore the stability of such models by analyzing the impact of high
percentage of fat infiltrations and local transverse relaxation differences
among biological species. Results: The main limits of the MRI relaxometry are
the presence of bias and the occurrence of artifacts which affect its accuracy.
Chemical-shift complex reconstructions R2*-corrected with 1D formulation
exhibit a large bias in presence of a significant difference in the relaxation
rates of fat and water and with fat concentration larger than 30%. We find that
for fat-dominated tissues or in patients affected by iron overload, MRI
reconstructions accounting for multi-exponential relaxation time provide
accurate R2* measurements and are less prone to numerical artifacts.
Conclusions: Complex fitting 2D formulation outperforms the conventional 1D
approximation in various diagnostic scenarios. Although it still lacks of
numerical stability which requires model enhancement and support from
spectroscopy, it offers promising perspectives for the development of
relaxometry as a reliable tool to improve tissue characterization and
monitoring of neuromuscular disorders.

super case, of the model studied by C.H.Conley and V.Ovsienko in \cite{CoOv12}.

$\mathcal{D}_{\lambda\mu}(\R^{2l+1|n})$ of differential operators is induced on
the space $\mathcal{H}_{\lambda\mu}(\R^{2l+1|n})$ and therefore on the

space $\mathcal{P}_\delta(\R^{2l+1|n})$ of symbols of Heisenberg and on the
space of fine symbol $\Sigma_\delta(\R^{2l+1|n})$.

account for the additional colour selection. The reddest galaxies which have
[3.4]-[4.6] > 0.8 and are sometimes classified as AGN by their colour, make up
0.2% of nearby galaxies. However, the reddest galaxies are a rising fraction of
the low mass galaxy population. Identifying the lowest mass (M < 10$^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$ ) red ([3.4]-[4.6] > 0.8) galaxies as AGN is surprising given that
none are optical AGN or composites, in contrast with their more massive (M >
10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ ) red galaxy counter- parts that are dominated by optical
AGN and composites (86.4%). We also show that these low mass red galaxies are
associated with higher specific star formation rates than their bluer

the Montage toolkit ([ascl:1010.036]). The first release (October 2015)
supports multi-dimensional data sets (""data cubes""), and insertion of XMP/AVM
tags that allows images to ""drop-in"" to the WWT. The same release offers a
beta-version of web-based interactive visualization of images; this includes
wrappers for visualization in Python. Subsequent releases will support HEALPix
(now standard in cosmic background experiments); incorporation of Montage into
package managers (which enable automated management of software builds), and
support for a library that will enable Montage to be called directly from
Python. This next generation toolkit will inherit the architectural benefits of
the current engine - component based tools, ANSI-C portability across Unix
platforms and scalability for distributed processing. With the expanded
functionality under development, Montage can be viewed not simply as a mosaic

scatter inelastically off nuclei in direct detection experiments. This
inelastic transition causes the DM to up-scatter in terrestrial experiments
into an excited state up to 550 keV heavier than the DM itself. An inelastic
transition of this size is highly suppressed by both kinematics and nuclear
form factors. We extend previous studies of inelastic DM to determine the
present bounds on the scattering cross section, and the prospects for
improvements in sensitivity. Three scenarios provide illustrative examples:
nearly pure Higgsino DM; magnetic inelastic DM; and inelastic models with dark
photon exchange. We determine the elastic scattering rate as well as verify
that exothermic transitions are negligible. Presently, the strongest bounds on
the cross section are from xenon at LUX-PandaX (\delta < 160 keV), iodine at
PICO (160 < \delta < 300 keV), and tungsten at CRESST (when \delta > 300 keV).
Amusingly, once \delta > 200 keV, weak scale (and larger) DM - nucleon
scattering cross sections are allowed. The relative competitiveness of these
experiments is governed by the upper bound on the recoil energies employed by
each experiment, as well as strong sensitivity to the mass of the heaviest
element in the detector. Several implications, including sizable recoil
energy-dependent annual modulation, and improvements for future experiments are
discussed. We show that the xenon experiments can improve on the PICO results,
if they were to analyze their existing data over a larger range of recoil
energies, i.e., 20-500 keV. We also speculate about several reported events at
CRESST between 45-100 keV, that could be interpreted as inelastic DM
scattering. Future data from PICO, CRESST and xenon experiments can test this
with anaylses of high energy recoil data.

survey performed at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 2dFLenS is the first
wide-area spectroscopic survey specifically targeting the area mapped by
deep-imaging gravitational lensing fields, in this case the Kilo-Degree Survey.
2dFLenS obtained 70,079 redshifts in the range z < 0.9 over an area of 731 sq
deg, and is designed to extend the datasets available for testing gravitational
physics and promote the development of relevant algorithms for joint imaging
and spectroscopic analysis. The redshift sample consists first of 40,531
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), which enable analyses of galaxy-galaxy lensing,
redshift-space distortion, and the overlapping source redshift distribution by
cross-correlation. An additional 28,269 redshifts form a magnitude-limited (r <
19.5) nearly-complete sub-sample, allowing direct source classification and
photometric-redshift calibration. In this paper, we describe the motivation,
target selection, spectroscopic observations, and clustering analysis of
2dFLenS. We use power spectrum multipole measurements to fit the redshift-space
distortion parameter of the LRG sample in two redshift ranges 0.15 < z < 0.43
and 0.43 < z < 0.7 as beta = 0.49 +/- 0.15 and beta = 0.26 +/- 0.09,

Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. 2dFLenS data products will be released

  Letters [Appl. Phys. Lett. 108, 102401 (2016)]",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solid state-refrigerants have generated worldwide interest owing to their
growing potential for use in efficient and green cooling devices. Caloric
effects could be obtained by manipulating their degrees of freedom such as
magnetization, electric polarization and volume using a variable external
field. In conventional magnetocaloric refrigeration systems, the magnetocaloric
effect is exploited by moving the active material in and out of the magnetic
field source. Here we demonstrate that a giant and reversible magnetocaloric
effect can be generated simply by rotating the multiferroic TbMn2O5 single
crystal around its b axis in a relatively low constant magnetic field applied
in the ac plane. For a magnetic field applied along the easy axis a, we report
an entropy change of 12.25 J/kg K at about 10 K in a field change of 5 T which
is 100 times larger than that found when the field is applied along the hard
axis c. When the TbMn2O5 is rotated with the field remaining in the ac plane,
the associated adiabatic temperature change reaches minimum values of 8 K and
14 K under 2 T and 5 T, respectively. This giant rotating magnetocaloric effect
in TbMn2O5 is caused by the colossal anisotropy of the entropy change, the
enhancement of the magnetization under relatively moderate magnetic fields and
the lower magnitude of specific heat. On the other hand, the application of the
coherent rotational model demonstrates that the rotating magnetocaloric effect
exhibited by TbMn2O5 does not originate directly from the magneto-crystalline
anisotropy. Our results should inspire and open new ways toward the
implementation of compact, efficient and embedded magnetocaloric devices for
low temperature and space application. Its potential operating temperature
range of 2 to 30 K makes it a great candidate for the liquefaction of hydrogen.

between the charged particle and its macroscopic counterpart and compare it to
the decoherence rate, i.e. the rate at which quantum superposition decays. A
hybrid system can only be considered quantum if the coupling rate significantly
exceeds all decoherence rates. Our approach is to examine specific examples,
using parameters that are experimentally attainable in the foreseeable future.
We conclude that those hybrid quantum system considered involving an atomic ion
are unfavorable, compared to using an electron, since the coupling rates
between the charged particle and its counterpart are slower than the expected
decoherence rates. A system based on trapped electrons, on the other hand,
might have coupling rates which significantly exceed decoherence rates.
Moreover it might have appealing properties such as fast entangling gates, long
coherence and flexible electron interconnectivity topology. Realizing such a
system, however, is technologically challenging, since it requires
accommodating both trapping technology and superconducting circuitry in a
compatible manner. We review some of the challenges involved, such as the
required trap parameters, electron sources, electrical circuitry and cooling
schemes in order to promote further investigations towards the realization of
such a hybrid system.

representations to transfer the knowledge learned in one domain to other
domains. Traditional domain adaptation only considers adapting for one task. In
this paper, we explore multi-task representation learning under the domain
adaptation scenario. We propose a neural network framework that supports domain
adaptation for multiple tasks simultaneously, and learns shared representations
that better generalize for domain adaptation. We apply the proposed framework
to domain adaptation for sequence tagging problems considering two tasks:
Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition. Experiments show that
multi-task domain adaptation works better than disjoint domain adaptation for
each task, and achieves the state-of-the-art results for both tasks in the

analysis and the results of simulations, the cone-hyperboloid and
paraboloid-cone structures are found to provide the best angular resolutions,

International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The EXPRESS workshops aim at
bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various
formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency.
Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison between programming
concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented
programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process
algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on
the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS workshop series has
run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly
construed. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future
investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the
specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the
concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and
practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an
annual combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical
models of computation and the formal semantics of systems and programming
concepts.

qubit states into a minimum error discrimination for three qubit states by
adding a specific quantum state $\rho_{0}$ and a prior probability
$q_{0}$(which we will call an inconclusive degree), which we name the modified
FRIR problem. First, we investigate special inconclusive degrees $q_{0}^{(0)}$
and $q_{0}^{(1)}$, which appear naturally in the modified FRIR problem and are
the beginning and the end of practical interval of inconclusive degree, and
find the analytic form of them. Next, we show that the modified FRIR problem
can be classified into two cases $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(0)}$(or $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(1)}$)
and $q_{0}^{(0)}\!<\!q_{0}\!<\!q_{0}^{(1)}$. In fact, by maximum confidences of
two qubit states and non-diagonal element of $\rho_{0}$, the modified FRIR
problem is completely understood. Then, we provide an analytic solution of the

$q_{0}^{(0)}\!<\!q_{0}\!<\!q_{0}^{(1)}$, we rather supply the numerical method

degree and corresponding failure probability. Finally we confirm our results

varying backgrounds in astronomical images by means of small objects removal

transform. In contrast to popular background estimation techniques, our
algorithm allows for accurate extraction of complex structures, like galaxies
or nebulae. Moreover, it does not require multiple tuning parameters, since it
relies on physical properties of CCD image sensors - the gain and the read-out
noise characteristics. The comparison with other widely used background
estimators revealed higher accuracy of the proposed technique. The superiority
of the novel method is especially significant for the most challenging
fluctuating backgrounds. The size of filtered out objects is tunable, therefore
the algorithm may eliminate a wide range of foreground structures, including
the dark current impulses, cosmic rays or even entire galaxies in deep field
images.

the growth of entropy of convolutions. We explain the main result on
$\mathbb{R}$, and derive, via a linearization argument, an analogous result for
the action of the affine group on $\mathbb{R}$. We also develop versions of the
results for entropy dimension and Hausdorff dimension. The method is applied to
two problems on the border of fractal geometry and additive combinatorics.
First, we consider attractors $X$ of compact families $\Phi$ of similarities of
$\mathbb{R}$. We conjecture that if $\Phi$ is uncountable and $X$ is not a
singleton (equivalently, $\Phi$ is not contained in a 1-parameter semigroup)
then $\dim X=1$. We show that this would follow from the classical overlaps
conjecture for self-similar sets, and unconditionally we show that if $X$ is
not a point and $\dim\Phi>0$ then $\dim X=1$. Second, we study a problem due to
Shmerkin and Keleti, who have asked how small a set $\emptyset\neq
Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ can be if at every point it contains a scaled copy of the
middle-third Cantor set $K$. Such a set must have dimension at least $\dim K$
and we show that its dimension is at least $\dim K+\delta$ for some constant
$\delta>0$.

values (VEVs) of the charge and current densities induced by an external
magnetic flux in a two-dimensional circular ring. Both the irreducible
representations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the
bag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.
This leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial
current vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the
boundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are
odd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux
quantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and
current densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on
the ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the
outer edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked
near the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite
different features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford
algebra. We show that, unlike the VEVs in the boundary-free geometry, the
vacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the
magnetic flux and vanish for half-odd integer values of the flux in units of
the flux quantum. Combining the results for two irreducible representations, we
also investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time-reversal
symmetric models. The corresponding results are applied to graphene rings with
the electronic subsystem described in terms of the effective Dirac theory with
the energy gap. If the energy gaps for two valleys of the graphene hexagonal
lattice are the same, the charge densities corresponding to the separate
valleys cancel each other, whereas the azimuthal current is doubled.

concerning the oxygen gas-grain interaction in cold dense cores suggested that,
if O atoms could survive in the gas after most of the rest of the heavy

efficiently in the gas. Using Herschel HIFI we searched a small sample of four

demonstrate that likewise free electromagnetic field, both duality and helicity

the conservation of optical chirality. In gyrotropic crystals, which exhibit
natural optical activity, the situation is quite different from the case of
isotropic media. For light propagating along certain crystallographic
direction, there arise two distinct cases, i.~e., (1) the duality is broken but
the helicity is preserved, or (2) only the duality symmetry survives. We show
that the existence of one of these symmetries (duality or helicity) is enough
to define optical chirality. In addition, we present examples of low-symmetry

oscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not
depend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems
can be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding
manifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an
oscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific
parameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that
parameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given
certain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already
hinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical
underpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has
just been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for
time-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network
topologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent
starting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.

this calculation we use the SU(6) wavefunctions of the octet baryons and the
spectator model for the distribution functions of nucleons and the
fragmentation functions of hyperons. We find that that H1(z) of the Sigma
hyperons are much larger than that of the Lambda hyperon. Therefore, when one
tries to extract the transversity distribution h1(x) from the hyperon
polarizations, measuring the polarizations of the Sigma hyperons is more
efficient than Lambda.

$S=\frac{1}{2}$ on a diamond-like decorated square lattice. A diamond unit has
two types of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and the ratio $\lambda$
between the length of the diagonal bond and that of the other four edges
determines the strength of frustration. It has been pointed out [J. Phys. Soc.
Jpn {\bf85}, 033705 (2016)] that the so-called tetramer-dimer states, which are
expected to be stabilized in an intermediate region of $\lambda_{\rm
c}<\lambda<2$, are identical to the square-lattice dimer covering states, which
ignited renewed interest in high-dimensional diamond-like decorated lattices.
In order to determine the phase boundary $\lambda_{\rm c}$, we employ the
modified spin wave method to estimate the energy of the ferrimagnetic state and
obtain $\lambda_{\rm c}=0.974$. Our obtained magnetizations for
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ sites and for spin-1 sites are $m=0.398$ and
$\tilde{m}=0.949$, and spin reductions are 20 \% and 5\%, respectively. This
indicates that spin fluctuation is much smaller than that of the
$S=\frac{1}{2}$ square-lattice antiferromagnet: thus, we can consider that our
obtained ground-state energy is highly accurate. Further, our numerical
diagonalization study suggests that other cluster states do not appear in the

be applicable to uncertain systems and to control design, a lifting approach
introducing a clock-variable is then considered in order to make the conditions

metals, two-dimensional liquids like $\rm ^3He$, compounds with quantum spin
liquids, quasicrystals, and systems with one-dimensional quantum spin liquid.
We name these various systems HF compounds, since they exhibit the behavior
typical of HF metals. In HF compounds at zero temperature the unique phase
transition, dubbed throughout as the fermion condensation quantum phase
transition (FCQPT) can occur; this FCQPT creates flat bands which in turn lead
to the specific state, known as the fermion condensate. Unlimited increase of
the effective mass of quasiparticles signifies FCQPT; these quasiparticles
determine the thermodynamic, transport and relaxation properties of HF
compounds. Our discussion of numerous salient experimental data within the
framework of FCQPT resolves the mystery of the new state of matter. Thus, FCQPT
and the fermion condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the
non-Fermi liquid behavior observed in various HF compounds. We show
analytically and using arguments based completely on the experimental grounds
that these systems exhibit universal scaling behavior of their thermodynamic,
transport and relaxation properties. Therefore, the quantum physics of
different HF compounds is universal, and emerges regardless of the microscopic
structure of the compounds. This uniform behavior allows us to view it as the
main characteristic of a new state of matter exhibited by HF compounds.

oriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image
classification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally
efficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for contour detection
and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for hierarchical
segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the
state-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and
datasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour
strength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform
extensive experiments on BSDS, PASCAL Context, PASCAL Segmentation, and
MS-COCO, showing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours, region
hierarchies, and object proposals in all datasets.

  for Requirements Changes","44 pages",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software systems usually operate in a dynamic context where their
requirements change continuously and new requirements emerge frequently. A
single requirement hardly exists in isolation: it is related to other
requirements and to the software development artifacts that implement it. When
a requirements change is introduced, the requirements engineer may have to
manually analyze all requirements and architectural elements for a single
change. This may result in neglecting the actual impact of a change. We aim at
improving change impact analysis in software architecture for requirements
changes by using formal semantics of requirements relations, requirements
changes and traces between Requirements & Architecture. In our previous work we
presented a technique for change impact analysis in requirements. The technique
uses the formal semantics of requirements relations and changes. Its output is
a set of candidate requirements for the impact with proposed changes and a
propagation path in the requirements model. In this paper we present a
complementary technique which propagates requirements changes to software
architecture and finds out which architectural elements are impacted by these
changes. The formalization of requirements relations, changes and traces
between R&A is used to determine candidate architectural elements for the
impact of requirements changes in the architecture. The tool support is an
extension of our Tool for Requirements Inferencing and Consistency Checking
(TRIC). Our approach helps in the elimination of some false positive impacts in
change propagation. We illustrate our approach in an industrial example which
shows that the formal semantics of requirements relations, changes and traces
enables the identification of candidate architectural elements with the
reduction of some false positive impacts.

spectra as a function of polarisation and temperature. We observe gap
excitations and fluctuations for all doping levels studied. The response from
fluctuations is much stronger for Co substitution and, according to the
selection rules and the temperature dependence, originates from the exchange of
two critical spin fluctuations with characteristic wave vectors $(\pm\pi, 0)$
and $(0,\pm\pi)$. At 22\% K doping ($p=0.22$), we find the same selection rules
and spectral shape for the fluctuations but the intensity is smaller by a
factor of 5. Since there exists no nematic region above the orthorhombic
spin-density-wave (SDW) phase the identification of the fluctuations via the
temperature dependence is not possible. The gap excitations in the
superconducting state indicate strongly anisotropic near-nodal gaps for Co
substitution which make the observation of collective modes difficult. The
variation with doping of the spectral weights of the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ gap
features does not support the influence of fluctuations on Cooper pairing.
Therefore, the observation of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes inside the nearly clean

investigate the competition and interplay between the pair-breaking effect that

distinct distances must have some special structure. In particular, such sets
are believed to be similar to a lattice. This note considers two different ways
to quantify this idea.
  Firstly, improving on a result of Hanson (see arXiv:1607.03442), it is proven
that if $P= A \times A$ with $A \subset \mathbb R$ and $P$ determines
$O(|A|^2)$ distinct distances, then $|A-A|=O\left(|A|^{2-\frac{2}{11}}\right)$.
This result gives further evidence that cartesian products which determine few
distinct distances have some additive structure.
  Secondly, it is shown that if a set $P \subset \mathbb R^2$ of $N$ points
determines $O(N/\sqrt {\log N})$ distinct distances, then there exists a
reflection $\mathcal R$ and a set $P' \subset P$ with $|P'| =\Omega (
\log^{3/2} N)$ such that $\mathcal R(P') \subset P$. In other words, sets with
few distinct distances have some degree of reflexive symmetry.

the concept of cost centers and a program transformation that allows the static
inference of functions that return bounds on these accumulated costs depending
on input data sizes, for each cost center of interest. Such information is much
more useful to the software developer than the traditional resource usage
functions, as it allows identifying the parts of a program that should be

Palatini $f(R)$ formalisms. The theory is very successful in accounting for the
observed phenomenology, since it unifies local constraints at the Solar System
level and the late-time cosmic acceleration, even if the scalar field is very
light. We derive the equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetric
configuration (mass continuity and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) in the framework
of hybrid metric-Palatini theory, and we investigate their solutions
numerically for different equations of state of neutron and quark matter, by
adopting for the scalar field potential a Higgs-type form. Stellar models,
described by the stiff fluid, radiation-like, the bag model and the
Bose-Einstein Condensate equations of state are explicitly constructed in both
General Relativity and hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, thus allowing an in
depth comparison between the predictions of these two gravitational theories.
As a general result it turns out that for all the considered equations of
state, hybrid metric-Palatini gravity stars are more massive than their general
relativistic counterparts. Furthermore, two classes of stellar models
corresponding to fixed forms of the scalar field are also investigated.
Interestingly enough, in the case of a constant scalar field the equation of
state of the matter takes the form of the bag model equation of state
describing quark matter. As a possible astrophysical application of the
obtained results we suggest that stellar mass black holes, with masses in the
range of $3.8M_{\odot}$ and $6M_{\odot}$, respectively, could be in fact hybrid
metric-Palatini gravity neutron or quark stars.

conductance has a value of exactly one quantum unit, and that this is rather
insensitive to the strength of coupling of the probes to the system, provided
values of the coupling are of the same order as the mean inter-level spacing of
the system without probes. For the Cu atom chain we find in addition that away
from the regions with probes attached, the potential in the wire is uniform,
while within them it follows a predicted exponential variation with position.
We then apply the method to an initial investigation of the suitability of
graphene as a contact material for molecular electronics. We perform
calculations on a carbon nanoribbon to determine the correct coupling strength
of the probes to the graphene, and obtain a conductance of about two quantum
units corresponding to two bands crossing the Fermi surface. We then compute
the current through a benzene molecule attached to two graphene contacts and
find only a very weak current because of the disruption of the

viscous processes inside an accretion disk. By the time the flow reaches the
inner edge, the variation in X-rays needs not reflect the true variation of the
rate at the outer edge. However, if the viscosity fluctuates around a mean
value, one would expect the viscous time scale also to spread around a mean
value. In HMXBs, the size of the viscous Keplerian disk is smaller & thus such
a spread could be lower as compared to the LMXBs. If there is an increasing or
decreasing trend in viscosity, the interval between enhanced emission would be
modified systematically. In the absence of a full knowledge about the variation
of mass supply rates at the outer edge, we study ideal circumstances where
modulation must take place exactly in orbital time scales when there is an
ellipticity in the orbit. We study a few compact binaries using long term
RXTE/ASM(1.5-12 keV) & Swift/BAT(15-50keV) data to look for such effects & to
infer what these results can tell us about the viscous processes inside the
respective disks. We employ three different methods to seek imprints of
periodicity on the X-ray variation & found that in all the cases, the location
of the peak in the power density spectra is consistent with the orbital
frequencies. Interestingly, in HMXBs the peaks are sharp with high rms values,
consistent with a small Keplerian disk in a wind fed system. However, in LMXBs
with larger Keplerian disk, the peaks are spread out with much lower rms
values. X-ray reflections, or superhump phenomena which may also cause such
X-ray modulations would not be affected by the size of the Keplerian disk. Our
result confirms different sizes of Keplerian disks in 2 classes of binaries. If
the orbital period of a binary system is not known, it may be obtained with
reasonable accuracy for HMXBs & with lesser accuracy for LMXBs by our method.

terms of $K$ smaller dictionaries. It is assumed the data are generated by
linear combinations of these structured dictionary atoms and observed through
white Gaussian noise. This work first provides a general lower bound on the
minimax risk of dictionary learning for such tensor data and then adapts the
proof techniques for specialized results in the case of sparse and
sparse-Gaussian linear combinations. The results suggest the sample complexity
of dictionary learning for tensor data can be significantly lower than that for
unstructured data: for unstructured data it scales linearly with the product of
the dictionary dimensions, whereas for tensor-structured data the bound scales
linearly with the sum of the product of the dimensions of the (smaller)
component dictionaries. A partial converse is provided for the case of
2nd-order tensor data to show that the bounds in this paper can be tight. This
involves developing an algorithm for learning highly-structured dictionaries
from noisy tensor data. Finally, numerical experiments highlight the advantages

Differently from homopolymers, random heteropolymers display at different

self--averaging quantities makes finite--size effects dominant at low

MACSJ0417.5-1154, MACSJ1131.8-1955, MACSJ0308.9+2645, MACSJ2243.3-0935,
MACSJ2228.5+2036 and MACSJ0358.8-2955. We detect diffuse radio emission (halo

not detect any diffuse radio emission but we put stringent upper-limits on
their radio powers. We also use archival {\it Chandra} X-ray data to carry out
morphology and substructure analysis of these clusters. We find that based on
X-ray data, these MACS clusters are non-relaxed and show substructures in their
temperature distribution. The radio powers of the first four MACS clusters are
consistent with their expected values in the $L_{x}$--$P_{1.4GHz}$ plot.
{However, we found ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the MACSJ0417.5-1154

two clusters whose radio powers are $\sim$ 11 times below the expected values

cavity the mechanical oscillation shifts the resonance frequency of the cavity
in a ring resonator the frequency does not change. Instead the position of the
nodes is shifted with the mechanical excursion. We derive the damping rates and
test the results experimentally with a silicon-nitride nanomembrane. It turns
out that scattering from small imperfections of the dielectric mirror coatings

We extend our theoretical model and regard a second reflector in the cavity

also describe the situation of two membranes that both interact with the cavity

study involving multifluid global simulations including Ohmic dissipation,
ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect in a dynamic, self-consistent way. We
focus on the turbulence resulting from the non-linear development of the MRI in
radially stratified PPDs and compare with ideal MHD simulations.
  In the multifluid simulations the disk is initially set up to transition from
a weak Hall dominated regime, where the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal
effect but approximately the same as or weaker than the inductive term, to a
strong Hall dominated regime, where the Hall effect dominates the inductive
term. As the simulations progress a substantial portion of the disk develops
into a weak Hall dominated disk. We find a transition from turbulent to laminar
flow in the inner regions of the disk, but without any corresponding overall
density feature.
  We introduce a dimensionless parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{RM}$, to characterise
accretion with $\alpha_\mathrm{RM} \gtrsim 0.1$ corresponding to turbulent
transport. We calculate the eddy turnover time, $t_\mathrm{eddy}$, and compared
this with an effective recombination timescale, $t_\mathrm{rcb}$, to determine
whether the presence of turbulence necessitates non-equilibrium ionisation
calculations. We find that $t_\mathrm{rcb}$ is typically around three orders of
magnitude smaller than $t_\mathrm{eddy}$. Also, the ionisation fraction does
not vary appreciably. These two results suggest that these multifluid
simulations should be comparable to single fluid non-ideal simulations.

a broad range of users, but they often exhibit two limitations: the built-in
features cannot possibly cover all use cases, and the internal representation
of the content is not readily exposed. We believe that if direct manipulation
interfaces were to (a) use general-purpose programs as the representation
format, and (b) expose those programs to the user, then experts could customize
these systems in powerful new ways and non-experts could enjoy some of the
benefits of programmable systems.
  In recent work, we presented a prototype SVG editor called Sketch-n-Sketch
that offered a step towards this vision. In that system, the user wrote a
program in a general-purpose lambda-calculus to generate a graphic design and
could then directly manipulate the output to indirectly change design
parameters (i.e. constant literals) in the program in real-time during the
manipulation. Unfortunately, the burden of programming the desired
relationships rested entirely on the user.
  In this paper, we design and implement new features for Sketch-n-Sketch that
assist in the programming process itself. Like typical direct manipulation
systems, our extended Sketch-n-Sketch now provides GUI-based tools for drawing
shapes, relating shapes to each other, and grouping shapes together. Unlike
typical systems, however, each tool carries out the user's intention by
transforming their general-purpose program. This novel, semi-automated
programming workflow allows the user to rapidly create high-level, reusable
abstractions in the program while at the same time retaining direct
manipulation capabilities. In future work, our approach may be extended with
more graphic design features or realized for other application domains.

Rayleigh fading follow a normal distribution when large antenna arrays are
employed. The proposed beamforming algorithm is effective in both sparse and
rich propagation environments, and is applicable for both point-to-point and
multiuser scenarios. In addition, a closed-form expression and a lower-bound
for the achievable rates are derived when analog and digital phase shifters are
employed. It is shown that the performance of the hybrid beamformers using
phase shifters with more than 2-bits resolution is comparable with analog phase
shifting. A novel phase shifter selection scheme that reduces the power
consumption at the phase shifter network is proposed when the wireless channel
is modeled by Rayleigh fading. Using this selection scheme, the spectral
efficiency can be increased as the power consumption in the phase shifter
network reduces. Compared to the scenario that all of the phase shifters are in
operation, the simulation results indicate that the spectral efficiency
increases when up to 50% of phase shifters are turned off.

generated through the interaction of STSP, robot, and environment (closed-loop
configuration), including various forward meandering and circular motions,
together with chaotic trajectories. The observed locomotion is robust with
respect to additional interactions with obstacles. In the chaotic phase the
robot is seemingly engaged in actively exploring its environment. We believe
that our results constitute a concept of proof that transient synaptic
plasticity, as described by STSP, may potentially be important for the
generation of motor commands and for the emergence of complex locomotion
patterns, adapting seamlessly also to unexpected environmental feedback. We
observe spontaneous and collision induced mode switchings, finding in addition,
that locomotion may follow transiently limit cycles which are otherwise
unstable. Regular locomotion corresponds to stable limit cycles in the
sensorimotor loop, which may be characterized in turn by arbitrary angles of
propagation. This degeneracy is, in our analysis, one of the drivings for the
chaotic wandering observed for selected parameter settings, which is induced by
the smooth diffusion of the angle of propagation.

  from overposed data","24 pages",,"10.1088/1361-6420/aa573e",,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been considerable recent study in ""sub-diffusion"" models that
replace the standard parabolic equation model by a one with a fractional
derivative in the time variable. There are many ways to look at this newer
approach and one such is to realize that the order of the fractional derivative
is related to the time scales of the underlying diffusion process. This raises
the question of what order ? of derivative should be taken and if a single
value actually suffices. This has led to models that combine a finite number of
these derivatives each with a different fractional exponent \alpha_k and
different weighting value c_k to better model a greater possible range of time
scales. Ultimately, one wants to look at a situation that combines derivatives
in a continuous way { the so-called distributional model with parameter
\mu(\alpha). However all of this begs the question of how one determines this
""order"" of differentiation. Recovering a single fractional value has been an
active part of the process from the beginning of fractional diffusion modeling
and if this is the only unknown then the markers left by the fractional order
derivative are relatively straightforward to determine. In the case of a finite
combination of derivatives this becomes much more complex due to the more
limited analytic tools available for such equations, but recent progress in
this direction has been made, [9, 8]. This paper considers the full
distributional model where the order is viewed as a function \mu(\alpha) on the
interval (0; 1]. We show existence, uniqueness and regularity for an
initial-boundary value problem including an important representation theorem in
the case of a single spatial variable. This is then used in the inverse problem
of recovering the distributional coefficient \mu(\alpha) from a time trace of
the solution and a uniqueness result is proven.

the dynamic delivery of fluence maps in radiation therapy. For a given fluence
map and a given delivery time, the optimization of the leaf trajectories of a
multi-leaf collimator to approximately form the given fluence map is a
non-convex optimization problem. Its general solution has not been addressed in
the literature, despite the fact that dynamic delivery of fluence maps has long
been a common approach to intensity modulated radiation therapy. We model the
leaf trajectory and dose rate optimization as a non-convex continuous
optimization problem and solve it by an interior point method from randomly
initialized feasible starting solutions. We demonstrate the method on a fluence
map from a prostate case and a larger fluence map from a head-and-neck case.
While useful for static beam IMRT delivery, our main motivation for this work
is the extension to the case of sequential fluence map delivery, i.e. the case
of VMAT, which is the topic of the second paper.

cold, narrow and constant Fe K alpha line at 6.4 keV, and a broad component is

primary power law with Gamma=1.6-1.8 and an exponential cut-off varying from

soft excess correlated with the primary power law. This campaign shows that
probing the variability of Seyfert 1 galaxies on different time-scales is of

for predicting the unsteady lift of two-dimensional aerofoils in subsonic flow,
using approximate numerical and analytical formulations. Both a step-change in
the angle of attack and a sharp-edge gust are suitably considered as small
perturbations. Novel contributions concern both a systematic analysis of the
computational simulations process and an effective theoretical synthesis of its
outcome, providing with sound cross-validation. Good practice for generating
the indicial-admittance functions via computational fluid dynamics is first
investigated for several Mach numbers, angles of attack and aerofoil profiles.
Convenient analytical approximations of such indicial functions are then
obtained by generalising those available for incompressible flow, taking
advantage of acoustic wave theory for the non-circulatory airload and
Prandtl-Glauert's scalability rule for the circulatory airload. An explicit
parametric formula is newly proposed for modelling the latter as function of
the Mach number in the absence of shock waves, while damped harmonic terms are
effectively introduced for better approximating the former. Appropriate tuning
of the analytical expressions is also derived in order to mimic the numerical
solutions and successfully verify the rigor of superposing circulatory and
non-circulatory theoretical contributions in the light of computational fluid
dynamics. Results are finally shown and critically addressed with respect to
the physical and mathematical assumptions employed, within a consistent
framework.

  ID# arXiv:1803.03126) on arxiv. Again, please see paper arXiv:1803.03126",,,,"physics.class-ph gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, resolutions will be given for commonly stated problems
associated with a model that assumes that space and time are discretized (i.e.,
atomized). This model is in contrast to the continuous space-time model that is
used in all common physical theories and equations -- a model that assumes that
spatial coordinates and time are continuous variables. The resolutions to the
problems are arrived at, not by proposing any new theories or postulates, but
by strictly adhering to: Ernst Mach's principle of non-absolute space, the
tenets of logical positivism, quantum mechanics and general relativity. The
problems associated with discrete space-time addressed in this paper include:
Lorentz contraction (time dilation) of the ostensibly smallest spatial
(temporal) interval, maintaining isotropy, violations of causality, and
conservation of energy and momentum. Importantly, this work yields
modifications to the standard formulae for time dilation and length
contraction, with these modifications preserving the quantums of space and time
and allowing for temporary travel at the speed of light. Also given are: a
resolution to Weyl's tile argument, a modification of the 2500 year old
Pythagoras's theorem, a reassessment of Henri Bergson's theory advocating a
distinction between the time durations measured by scientists and an immutable
""Time"", and a discussion of whether Einstein's light-clocks are as ideal as
most scientist believe. Also included is a demonstration of how discrete space
imposes order upon John Wheeler's quantum foam such that the foam becomes a
gravity crystal permeating all space and producing measurable inertial
anomalies of astronomical bodies.

diffusion coefficients of energetic particles along and across the mean
magnetic field. We focus on turbulence and particle parameters which should be
relevant for the solar system and compare our findings with different
interplanetary observations. We vary different parameters such as the
dissipation range spectral index, the ratio of the turbulence bendover scales,
and the magnetic field strength in order to explore the relevance of the
different parameters. We show that the bendover scales as well as the magnetic
field ratio have a strong influence on diffusion coefficients whereas the
influence of the dissipation range spectral index is weak. The best agreement
with solar wind observations can be found for equal bendover scales and a
magnetic field ratio of $\delta$B/B0 = 0.75.

  coefficient of particles interacting with two-component turbulence","Paper was accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal on
  August 8th, 2016",,"10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/130",,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the transport of energetic particles in two-component turbulence
in which the stochastic magnetic field is assumed to be a superposition of slab
and two-dimensional modes. It is known that in magnetostatic slab turbulence,
the motion of particles across the mean magnetic field is subdiffusive. If a
two-dimensional component is added, diffusion is recovered. It was also shown
before that in two-component turbulence, the slab modes do not explicitly
contribute to the perpendicular diffusion coefficient. In the current paper the
implicit contribution of slab modes is explored and it is shown that this
contribution leads to a reduction of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient.
This effect improves the agreement between simulations and analytical theory.
Furthermore, the obtained results are relevant for investigations of diffusive
shock acceleration.

  anharmonic vibrations and phasons","16 pages, 11 figures, Int. Conf. on Cold Fusion (ICCF20). arXiv admin
  note: text overlap with arXiv:1510.06081",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quasicrystals (QCs) are a novel form of matter, which are neither crystalline
nor amorphous. Among many surprising properties of QCs is their high catalytic
activity. We propose a mechanism explaining this peculiarity based on unusual
dynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic
vibrations (LAVs) and phasons. In the former case, one deals with a large
amplitude (~ fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small
group of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as
discrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs.
On the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are
represented by very large amplitude (~angstrom) oscillations of atoms be-tween
two quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude
atomic motion in LAVs and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent
potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons) in case of
hydrogenated QCs. This driving may result in the increase of amplitude and
energy of zero-point vibrations (ZPV). Based on that, we demonstrate a drastic
increase of the D-D or D-H fusion rate with increasing number of modulation
periods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account
suppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations. In this context,
we present numerical solution of Schrodinger equation for a particle in a
non-stationary double well potential, which is driven time-periodically
imitating the action of a LAV or phason. We show that the rate of tunneling of
the particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is enhanced
drastically by the driving, and it increases strongly with increasing amplitude
of the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs
that can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.

  Process","13 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern software development teams are distributed across onsite and off-shore
locations. Each team has developers with varying experience levels and English
communication skills. In such a diverse development environment it is important
to maintain the software quality, coding standards, timely delivery of features
and bug fixes. It is also important to reduce testing effort, minimize side
effects such as change in functionality, user experience or application
performance. Code reviews are intended to control code quality. Unfortunately,
many projects lack enforcement of processes and standards because of
approaching deadlines, live production issues and lack of resource
availability. This study examines a novel structured, unit testable templated
code method to enforce code review standards with an intent to reduce coding
effort, minimize revisions and eliminate functional and performance side
effects on the system. The proposed method would also result in unit-testable
code that can also be easily rolled back and increase team productivity. The
baseline for traditional code review processes using metrics such as code
review duration, bug regression rate, revision count was measured. These
metrics were then compared with results from the proposed code review process
that used structured unit testable templated code. The performance on 2 large
enterprise level applications spanning over 2 years and 9 feature and
maintenance release cycles was evaluated. The structured unit testable
templated code method resulted in a decrease in total code review time,
revision count and coding effort. It also decreased the number of live
production issues caused by code churn or side effects of bug fix when compared
to traditional code review process.
