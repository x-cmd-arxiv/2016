nonlinear observations of their superposition. Mathematically, we consider a
nonlinear signal observation model, $y_i = g(a_i^Tx) + e_i, \ i=1,\ldots,m$,
where $x = \Phi w+\Psi z$ denotes the superposition signal, $\Phi$ and $\Psi$
are orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $w, z\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are sparse
coefficient vectors of the constituent signals, and $e_i$ represents the noise.
Moreover, $g$ represents a nonlinear link function, and $a_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is
the $i$-th row of the measurement matrix, $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$.
Problems of this nature arise in several applications ranging from astronomy,
computer vision, and machine learning. In this paper, we make some concrete
algorithmic progress for the above demixing problem. Specifically, we consider
two scenarios: (i) the case when the demixing procedure has no knowledge of the
link function, and (ii) the case when the demixing algorithm has perfect
knowledge of the link function. In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for
recovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we
support these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive
(nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms
for achieving stable recovery of the component signals. We also provide a range
of numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithms on both real and synthetic signals and images.

vocabulary. Words are assigned to clusters based on their usage pattern in a
given corpus. The resulting clusters and hierarchical structure can be used in
constructing class-based language models and for generating features to be used
in NLP tasks. Because of its high computational cost, the most-used version of
Brown clustering is a greedy algorithm that uses a window to restrict its
search space. Like other clustering algorithms, Brown clustering finds a
sub-optimal, but nonetheless effective, mapping of words to clusters. Because
of its ability to produce high-quality, human-understandable cluster, Brown
clustering has seen high uptake the NLP research community where it is used in
the preprocessing and feature generation steps.
  Little research has been done towards improving the quality of Brown
clusters, despite the greedy and heuristic nature of the algorithm. The
approaches tried so far have focused on: studying the effect of the
initialisation in a similar algorithm; tuning the parameters used to define the
desired number of clusters and the behaviour of the algorithm; and including a
separate parameter to differentiate the window from the desired number of
clusters. However, some of these approaches have not yielded significant
improvements in cluster quality.
  In this thesis, a close analysis of the Brown algorithm is provided,
revealing important under-specifications and weaknesses in the original
algorithm. These have serious effects on cluster quality and reproducibility of
research using Brown clustering. In the second part of the thesis, two
modifications are proposed. Finally, a thorough evaluation is performed,
considering both the optimization criterion of Brown clustering and the
performance of the resulting class-based language models.

magnetars. Here we study the magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars taking
into consideration the effect of strong magnetic fields on the crustal
composition (magnetised crust). We calculate global magneto-elastic (GME) modes
as well as modes confined to the crust (CME) only. The composition of the crust
directly affects its shear modulus which we calculate using three different
nucleon-nucleon interactions: SLy4, SkM and Sk272. The shear modulus of the
crust is found to be enhanced in strong magnetic fields $\geq 10^{17}$ G for
all those Skyrme interactions. It is noted that the shear modulus of the crust
for the SLy4 interaction is much higher than those of the SkM and Sk272
interactions in presence of magnetic fields or not. Though we do not find any
appreciable change in frequencies of fundamental GME and CME modes with and
without magnetised crusts, frequencies of first overtones of CME modes are
significantly affected in strong magnetic fields $\geq 10^{17}$ G. However,
this feature is not observed in frequencies of first overtones of GME modes. As
in earlier studies, it is also noted that the effects of crusts on frequencies
of both types of maneto-elastic modes disappear when the magnetic field reaches
the critical field ($B > 4 \times 10^{15}$ G). Frequencies of GME and CME modes
calculated with magnetised crusts based on all three nucleon-nucleon
interactions, stellar models and magnetic fields, are compared with frequencies
of observed quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOS) in SGR 1806-20 and SGR1900+14.
As in earlier studies, this comparison indicates that GME modes are essential
to explain all the frequencies as CME modes can explain only the higher
frequencies.

Lipschitz-continuous. Since almost all gradient-based optimization algorithms
rely on Lipschitz-continuity, optimizing Poisson likelihood models with a
guarantee of convergence can be challenging, especially for large-scale

  We present a new perspective allowing to efficiently optimize a wide range of
penalized Poisson likelihood objectives. We show that an appropriate saddle
point reformulation enjoys a favorable geometry and a smooth structure.
Therefore, we can design a new gradient-based optimization algorithm with
$O(1/t)$ convergence rate, in contrast to the usual $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ rate of
non-smooth minimization alternatives. Furthermore, in order to tackle problems
with large samples, we also develop a randomized block-decomposition variant
that enjoys the same convergence rate yet more efficient iteration cost.
  Experimental results on several point process applications including social

coincide also with observational estimations from galaxy surveys. This allows
to compare the analytical superwind solution with outflows from different kinds

possible and also characterize distinct flow regimes and enrichment scenarios.
We also constraint the parameter space by giving approximate limits above which
gravitation, self-gravitation and radiative cooling can inhibit the stationary

highly depends on the steepness and concentration of the dynamical mass and the
mass and energy injection rates. We compare our results with observational data

Voronoi shaping, maps short blocks of integers to the dithered Voronoi

Voronoi integers are encoded using a high-dimensional lattice retaining the
same shaping and coding gains of low and high-dimensional lattices. A drawback
to this construction is that there is no isomorphism between the underlying

nested lattice codes, in which a high-dimensional coding lattice is nested
inside a concatenation of low-dimensional shaping lattices. This construction
not only retains the same shaping/coding gains as first construction but also
provides the desired algebraic structure. We numerically study these methods,
for point-to-point channels as well as compute-and-forward using low-density
lattice codes (LDLCs) as coding lattices and E8 and Barnes-Wall as shaping

fuzzy set theory, we transform available prior knowledge into a mathematical

multiview fusion and tracking. Furthermore, the functionality of the proposed
approach is validated on a comprehensive simulated 3D+t benchmark data set that
mimics embryonic development and on large-scale light-sheet microscopy data of
a zebrafish embryo. The general concept introduced in this contribution
represents a new approach to efficiently exploit prior knowledge to improve the
result quality of image analysis pipelines. Especially, the automated analysis
of terabyte-scale microscopy data will benefit from sophisticated and efficient

subject of intense research due to their potential applications in spintronics
and quantum information technology. In particular, in systems which break
inversion symmetry, SOC facilitates the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect, leading to a
lifting of spin degeneracy in the bulk and intricate spin textures of the Bloch
wave functions. Here, by combining angular resolved photoemission (ARPES) and
low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements with
relativistic first-principles band structure calculations, we examine the role
of SOC in single crystals of noncentrosymmetric BiPd. We report the detection
of several Dirac surface states, one of which exhibits an extremely large spin
splitting. Unlike the surface states in inversion-symmetric systems, the Dirac
surface states of BiPd have completely different properties at opposite faces
of the crystal and are not trivially linked by symmetry. The spin-splitting of
the surface states exhibits a strong anisotropy by itself, which can be linked
to the low in-plane symmetry of the surface termination.

Hamilton cycle} if $C$ covers all the vertices of $H$ and there exists a cyclic
ordering of these vertices such that the edges in $C$ are segments of that
order and such that every two consecutive edges share exactly one vertex. The
binomial random $k$-uniform hypergraph $H^k_{n,p}$ has vertex set $[n]$ and an
edge set $E$ obtained by adding each $k$-tuple $e\in \binom{[n]}{k}$ to $E$
with probability $p$, independently at random.
  Here we consider the problem of finding edge-disjoint loose Hamilton cycles
covering all but $o(|E|)$ edges, referred to as the \emph{packing problem}.
While it is known that the threshold probability for the appearance of a loose
Hamilton cycle in $H^k_{n,p}$ is $p=\Theta\left(\frac{\log n}{n^{k-1}}\right)$,
the best known bounds for the packing problem are around
$p=\text{polylog}(n)/n$. Here we make substantial progress and prove the
following asymptotically (up to a polylog$(n)$ factor) best possible result:
For $p\geq \log^{C}n/n^{k-1}$, a random $k$-uniform hypergraph $H^k_{n,p}$ with
high probability contains $N:=(1-o(1))\frac{\binom{n}{k}p}{n/(k-1)}$
edge-disjoint loose Hamilton cycles.
  Our proof utilizes and modifies the idea of ""online sprinkling"" recently
introduced by Vu and the first author.

the consistency of our approach by the preservation of the operator commutation

from the conventional quantum Langevin approach which introduces noise
operators in addition to the quantum Heisenberg equations in order to preserve
commutation relations in the presence of loss. It is shown that the two

we derive is more general, remaining valid far from resonances.

machine translation, speech recognition, and question answering. Though capable
and easy to use, they require that the entirety of the input sequence is
available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not valid for
instantaneous translation and speech recognition. To address this problem, we
present a new method for solving sequence-to-sequence problems using hard
online alignments instead of soft offline alignments. The online alignments
model is able to start producing outputs without the need to first process the
entire input sequence. A highly accurate online sequence-to-sequence model is
useful because it can be used to build an accurate voice-based instantaneous
translator. Our model uses hard binary stochastic decisions to select the
timesteps at which outputs will be produced. The model is trained to produce
these stochastic decisions using a standard policy gradient method. In our
experiments, we show that this model achieves encouraging performance on TIMIT

observations of activities from each entity, an important problem is to learn
the hidden edges depicting directional relationships among these entities.
Here, we study causal relationships (excitations) that are realized by a
multivariate Hawkes process. The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) and its
variations (spatio-temporal point processes) have been used to study contagion
in earthquakes, crimes, neural spiking activities, the stock and foreign
exchange markets, etc. In this paper, we consider the multivariate Hawkes
process with gaps in observations (MHPG). We propose a variational problem for
detecting sparsely hidden relationships with a multivariate Hawkes process that
takes into account the gaps from each entity. We bypass the problem of dealing
with a large amount of missing events by introducing a small number of unknown
boundary conditions. In the case where our observations are sparse (e.g. from
10% to 30%), we show through numerical simulations that robust recovery with
MHPG is still possible even if the lengths of the observed intervals are small
but they are chosen accordingly. The numerical results also show that the
knowledge of gaps and imposing the right boundary conditions are very crucial
in discovering the underlying patterns and hidden relationships.

importance of social norms as solutions to major local and large-scale

reduction of smoking in public places to the change in fertility practices. Yet
a well-founded model of the effect of social norms on human cooperation is
still lacking. Using statistical physics techniques and integrating findings
from cognitive and behavioral sciences, we present an analytically-tractable
model in which individuals base their decisions to cooperate both on the
economic rewards they obtain and on the degree to which their action comply
with social norms. Results from this parsimonious model are in agreement with
what has been observed in recent large-scale experiments with humans. We also
find the phase diagram of the model and show that the experimental human group
is poised near a critical point, a regime where recent work suggests living
systems respond to changing external conditions in an efficient and coordinated

generic non-extremal three-dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black
holes. The proposal is that black hole microstates, which were dubbed as
horizon fluffs, are states labelled by the conserved charges associated with
non-trivial diffeomorphisms on the near horizon geometry and these states are
not in the coadjoint orbits of the asymptotic Virasoro algebra at the
Brown-Henneaux central charge, associated with the BTZ black holes. It is also
known that AdS3 Einstein gravity has more general black hole solutions than the
BTZ family which are generically described by two periodic, but otherwise
arbitrary, holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions. We show that these
general AdS3 black holes which are typically conformal descendants of the BTZ
black holes and are characterised by the associated Virasoro coadjoint orbits,
appear as coherent states in the asymptotic symmetry algebra corresponding to
the black hole family. We apply the horizon fluffs proposal to these generic
AdS3 black holes and identify the corresponding microstates. We then perform
microstate counting and compute the entropy. The entropy appears to be an orbit
invariant quantity, providing an important check for the horizon fluffs
proposal.

mantle from iron core provide abundant energy for heating its interior to
temperatures much higher than the present day Earth. The consequences of
differentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically
addressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible
`rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid
or solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at
sufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact.
Applying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory
molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for
the Fe-MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at
$\sim$4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such
that its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic
temperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core-mantle differentiation
following the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the
mixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that
high-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble
Mg-rich material to the early core. Since MgO is the least soluble major mantle
component in iron at low temperatures, these results may represent an upper
bound on temperature for mixing in terrestrial planets.

high-dimensional wireless communications. In this paper, a high-performance
belief propagation (BP)-based soft multiple-symbol differential detection
(MSDD) framework, dubbed BP-MSDD, is proposed with its illustrative application
in differential space-time block-code (DSTBC)-aided ultra-wideband impulse
radio (UWB-IR) systems. Firstly, we revisit the signal sampling with the aid of
a trellis structure and decompose the trellis into multiple subtrellises.
Furthermore, we derive an APP calculation algorithm, in which the
forward-and-backward message passing mechanism of BP operates on the
subtrellises. The proposed BP-MSDD is capable of significantly outperforming
the conventional hard-decision MSDDs. However, the computational complexity of
the BP-MSDD increases exponentially with the number of MSDD trellis states. To
circumvent this excessive complexity for practical implementations, we
reformulate the BP-MSDD, and additionally propose a Viterbi algorithm
(VA)-based hard-decision MSDD (VA-HMSDD) and a VA-based soft-decision MSDD
(VA-SMSDD). Moreover, both the proposed BP-MSDD and VA-SMSDD can be exploited
in conjunction with soft channel decoding to obtain powerful iterative
detection and decoding based receivers. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in DSTBC-aided UWB-IR systems.

their PageRank values indicating social importance and applied as variable
`term mass', gravitation as a metaphor to express changes in the semantic
content of a vector field lends a new perspective for experimentation. From
`term gravitation' over time, one can compute its generating potential whose

importance, thereby updating Osgood's semantic differential. The dataset

differently electrons and protons responded to the quiet modulation conditions

of four major mechanisms for the solar modulation of cosmic rays, cause
charge-sign dependent solar modulation. Solar minimum activity periods provide
optimal conditions to study these drift effects. The observed behaviour is
compared to the solutions of a three-dimensional model for cosmic rays in the

the former. The ERW model was introduced by Sch\""utz and Trimper [2004] to
study memory effects in a one-dimensional discrete-time random walk with a
complete memory of its past. The influence of the memory is measured in terms
of a parameter $p$ between zero and one. In the past years, a considerable
effort has been undertaken to understand the large-scale behavior of the ERW,
depending on the choice of $p$. Here, we use known results on urns to
explicitly solve the ERW in all memory regimes. The method works as well for
ERWs in higher dimensions and is widely applicable to related models.

are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model. However, there is some tension between the value of the
Hubble parameter $H_0$ inferred from the CMB and that inferred from
observations of the Universe at lower redshifts, and the unusually small value
of the dark-energy density is a puzzling ingredient of the model. In this
paper, we explore a scenario with a new exotic energy density that behaves like
a cosmological constant at early times and then decays quickly at some critical
redshift $z_c$. An exotic energy density like this is motivated by some
string-axiverse-inspired scenarios for dark energy. By increasing the expansion
rate at early times, the very precisely determined angular scale of the sound
horizon at decoupling can be preserved with a larger Hubble constant. We find,
however, that the Planck temperature power spectrum tightly constrains the
magnitude of the early dark-energy density and thus any shift in the Hubble
constant obtained from the CMB. If the reionization optical depth is required
to be smaller than the Planck 2016 $2\sigma$ upper bound $\tau\lesssim 0.0774$,
then early dark energy allows a Hubble-parameter shift of at most 1.6
km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ (at $z_c\simeq 1585$), too small to fully alleviate the
Hubble-parameter tension. Only if $\tau$ is increased by more than $5\sigma$
can the CMB Hubble parameter be brought into agreement with that from local
measurements. In the process, we derive strong constraints to the contribution
of early dark energy at the time of recombination---it can never exceed
$\sim2\%$ of the radiation/matter density for $10 \lesssim z_c \lesssim 10^5$.

$\alpha$ returns to the low value comparable to that in quiescence. In order to

Illustris simulation suite, one of the first simulations of galaxy formation

sizeable volume, to quantify the baryonic spin properties for more than $\sim$
320,000 haloes. We first compare the systematic differences between different
spin parameter and halo definitions, and the impact of sample selection
criteria on the derived properties. We confirm that dark matter only haloes
exhibit a close to self-similar spin distribution in mass and redshift of
lognormal form. However, the physics of galaxy formation radically changes the
baryonic spin distribution. While the dark matter component remains largely
unaffected, strong trends with mass and redshift appear for the spin of diffuse
gas and the formed stellar component. With time the baryons staying bound to
the halo develop a misalignment of their spin vector with respect to dark
matter, and increase their specific angular momentum by a factor of $\sim$ 1.3
in the non-radiative case and $\sim$ 1.8 in the full physics setup at z = 0. We
show that this enhancement in baryonic spin can be explained by the combined
effect of specific angular momentum transfer from dark matter onto gas during
mergers and from feedback expelling low specific angular momentum gas from the
halo. Our results challenge certain models for spin evolution and underline the
significant changes induced by baryonic physics in the structure of haloes.

example of the recently discovered TRAPPIST-1 system, we explore how ultracool
dwarfs facilitate the measurement of the spin--orbit angle for Earth-sized
planets by creating an effect that can be an order of magnitude more ample than
the Doppler reflex motion caused by the planet if the star is undergoing rapid
rotation. In TRAPPIST-1's case we expect the semi-amplitudes of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to be $40-50$ m/s for the known transiting planets.
Accounting for stellar jitter expected for ultracool dwarfs, instrumental
noise, and assuming radial velocity precisions both demonstrated and
anticipated for upcoming near-infrared spectrographs, we quantify the
observational effort required to measure the planets' masses and spin--orbit
angles. We conclude that if the planetary system is well-aligned then $\beta$
can be measured to a precision of $\lesssim 10^{\circ}$ if the spectrograph is
stable at the level of 2 m/s. We also investigate the measure of $\Delta
\beta$, the mutual inclination, when multiple transiting planets are present in
the system. Lastly, we note that the rapid rotation rate of many late M-dwarfs
will amplify the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal to the point where variations in

problems resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion
planning problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a
multi-query roadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate
reachability under different placements of movable objects. This structure
enables the EAS planner to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate
geometric and kinematic planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the
distance to the goal. Additionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete

received considerable attention in the last decade (Ponnuru et al. 2004;
Shapiro 2011; Baral and Dzifcak 2012; Schwitter 2013). Of special interest is
the problem of generating such representations directly from natural language
(NL) or controlled natural language (CNL). An interesting variation of this
problem, and to the best of our knowledge, scarcely explored variation in this
context, is when the input information is inconsistent. In such situations, the
existing encodings of word puzzles produce inconsistent representations and
break down. In this paper, we bring the well-known type of paraconsistent
logics, called Annotated Predicate Calculus (APC) (Kifer and Lozinskii 1992),
to bear on the problem. We introduce a new kind of non-monotonic semantics for
APC, called consistency preferred stable models and argue that it makes APC
into a suitable platform for dealing with inconsistency in word puzzles and,
more generally, in NL sentences. We also devise a number of general principles
to help the user choose among the different representations of NL sentences,
which might seem equivalent but, in fact, behave differently when inconsistent
information is taken into account. These principles can be incorporated into
existing CNL translators, such as Attempto Controlled English (ACE) (Fuchs et
al. 2008) and PENG Light (White and Schwitter 2009). Finally, we show that APC
with the consistency preferred stable model semantics can be equivalently
embedded in ASP with preferences over stable models, and we use this embedding
to implement this version of APC in Clingo (Gebser et al. 2011) and its Asprin

and are bounded by moderately dissected uplands. These plains contain the
highest density of filled and empty lake depressions, and canyons. These units
unconformably overlay a basement rock that outcrops as mountains and SAR-bright
dissected terrains at various elevations across both poles. All these units are
then superposed by surficial units that slope towards the seas, suggestive of
subsequent overland transport of sediment. From estimates of the depths of the
embedded empty depressions and canyons that drain into the seas, the SAR-dark
plains must be >600 m thick in places, though the thickness may vary across the
poles. At the lowest elevations of each polar region, there are large seas,
which are currently liquid methane/ethane filled at the north and empty at the
south. The large plains deposits and the surrounding hillslopes may represent
remnant landforms that are a result of previously vast polar oceans, where
larger liquid bodies may have allowed for a sustained accumulation of soluble

realizing higher dimensional physics in systems with limited spatial
dimensions. Non-spatial degrees of freedom in these systems are dubbed
""synthetic dimensions"". This connection is useful from an experimental
standpoint but complicated by the fact that interactions alter the condensate
ground state. Here we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study ground state
properties of a spin-1 Bose gas under the combined influence of an optical
lattice, spin-orbit coupling, and interactions at the mean field level. The
associated phases depend on the sign of the spin-dependent interaction
parameter and the strength of the optical lattice potential. We find ""charge""
and spin density wave phases which are directly related to helical spin order
in real space and affect the behavior of edge currents in the synthetic
dimension. We determine the resulting phase diagram as a function of the
spin-orbit coupling and spin-dependent interaction strength, considering both
attractive (ferromagnetic) and repulsive (polar) spin-dependent interactions.
Our results are applicable to current and future experiments, specifically with
$^{87}$Rb, $^{7}$Li, $^{41}$K, and $^{23}$Na.

settings is a challenging problem for a variety of reasons. Both servers and
clients may be added and/or removed from the system periodically, and the main
objectives of allocation algorithms are: the uniformity of the allocation, and
the number of moves after adding or removing a server or a client. The most
popular solution for our dynamic settings is Consistent Hashing. However, the
load balancing of consistent hashing is no better than a random assignment of
clients to servers, so with $n$ of each, we expect many servers to be
overloaded with $\Theta(\log n/ \log\log n)$ clients. In this paper, with $n$
clients and $n$ servers, we get a guaranteed max-load of 2 while only moving an
expected constant number of clients for each update.
  We take an arbitrary user specified balancing parameter $c=1+\epsilon>1$.
With $m$ balls and $n$ bins in the system, we want no load above $\lceil
cm/n\rceil$. Meanwhile we want to bound the expected number of balls that have
to be moved when a ball or server is added or removed. Compared with general
lower bounds without capacity constraints, we show that in our algorithm when a
ball or bin is inserted or deleted, the expected number of balls that have to
be moved is increased only by a multiplicative factor $O({1\over \epsilon^2})$
for $\epsilon \le 1$ (Theorem 4) and by a factor $1+O(\frac{\log c}c)$ for
$\epsilon\ge 1$ (Theorem 3). Technically, the latter bound is the most
challenging to prove. It implies that we for superconstant $c$ only pay a
negligible cost in extra moves. We also get the same bounds for the simpler
problem where we instead of a user specified balancing parameter have a fixed
bin capacity $C$ for all bins.

density flow based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. In
addition to the groundwater model, a 3D geophysical model was developed for
direct current resistivity imaging and inversion. The objective function of the
coupled problem consists of data misfit and regularization terms as well as a
coupling term that relates groundwater and geophysical states. We present a
novel approach to solve the inverse problem using an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to minimize this coupled objective function. The
sensitivities are derived analytically for the discretized system of equations,
which allows us to efficiently compute the gradients in the minimization
procedure and reduce the computational complexity of the problem. The method
was tested on different synthetic scenarios with groundwater and geophysical
data represented by solute mass fraction data and direct current resistivity
data. With the ADMM approach, we were able to obtain better estimates for the
solute distribution, compared to just considering each data set separately or
solving with a simple coupled approach.

equation in one-space dimension, $$ u_{tt} - \delta^2 u_{xx} +V'(u) =0 \qquad
x\in [0,1] $$ where $\delta>0$ is a parameter and $V(u)$ is a potential bounded
from below and growing at least like $u^2$ as $|u|\to\infty$. Infinite energy
solutions of this equation preserve a natural Gibbsian invariant measure and
when the potential is double-welled, for example when $V(u) =
\tfrac14(1-u^2)^2$, there is a regime such that two small disjoint sets in the
system's phase-space concentrate most of the mass of this measure. This
suggests that the solutions to the nonlinear wave equation can be metastable
over these sets, in the sense that they spend long periods of time in these
sets and only rarely transition between them. Here we quantify this phenomenon
by calculating exactly via Transition State Theory (TST) the mean frequency at
which the solutions of the nonlinear wave equation with initial conditions
drawn from its invariant measure cross a dividing surface lying in between the
metastable sets. Numerical results suggest that the dynamics of the nonlinear
wave equation is ergodic and rapidly mixing with respect to the Gibbs invariant
measure when the parameter $\delta$ in small enough. This is a regime in which
the dynamics of the nonlinear wave equation displays a metastable behavior that
is not fundamentally different from that observed in its stochastic counterpart
in which random noise and damping terms are added to the equation. For larger
$\delta$, however, the dynamics either stops being ergodic, or its mixing time
becomes larger than the inverse of the TST frequency, indicating that
successive transitions between the metastable sets are correlated and the
coarse-graining to a Markov chain fails.

coupling takes place through a lamda-type three-level system where two ground
spin states couple to a common excited state through a phonon-assisted as well
as a direct dipole optical transition. Both coherent population trapping and
optically-driven spin transitions have been realized. The coherent population
trapping demonstrates the coupling between a SAW and an electron spin coherence
through a dark state. The optically-driven spin transitions, which resemble the
sideband transitions in a trapped ion system, can enable the quantum control of
both spin and mechanical degrees of freedom and potentially a trapped-ion-like
solid state system for applications in quantum computing. These results
establish an experimental platform for spin-based quantum acoustic, bridging
the gap between spintronics and quantum acoustics.

the impact on the host's gas, star formation, and circum-galactic medium. We
find that jet feedback is energy-driven and wind feedback is momentum-driven.
In all the simulations, the jet or wind creates a cavity mostly devoid of dense
gas in the nuclear region where star formation is then quenched, but we find
strong positive feedback in all the simulations at radii greater than 3 kpc.
All four simulations have similar SFRs and stellar velocities with large radial

creates the highest density regions through ram pressure and generates the
highest rates of star formation due to its ongoing strong interaction with the
dense gas of the galactic plane. With increased wind inclination, we find
greater asymmetry in gas distribution and resulting star formation. Our model
generates an expanding ring of triggered star formation with typical velocity
of order 1/3 of the circular velocity, superimposed on the older stellar

a stellar-like object is a topic of permanent interest in the astrometric
community.
  Aims. We analyse bounds for the best position estimation of a stellar-like
object on a CCD detector array in a Bayesian setting where the position is
unknown, but where we have access to a prior distribution. In contrast to a
parametric setting where we estimate a parameter from observations, the
Bayesian approach estimates a random object (i.e., the position is a random
variable) from observations that are statistically dependent on the position.
  Methods. We characterize the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (CR) that bounds the minimum
mean square error (MMSE) of the best estimator of the position of a point
source on a linear CCD-like detector, as a function of the properties of
detector, the source, and the background.
  Results. We quantify and analyse the increase in astrometric performance from
the use of a prior distribution of the object position, which is not available
in the classical parametric setting. This gain is shown to be significant for
various observational regimes, in particular in the case of faint objects or
when the observations are taken under poor conditions. Furthermore, we present
numerical evidence that the MMSE estimator of this problem tightly achieves the
Bayesian CR bound. This is a remarkable result, demonstrating that all the
performance gains presented in our analysis can be achieved with the MMSE
estimator.
  Conclusions The Bayesian CR bound can be used as a benchmark indicator of the
expected maximum positional precision of a set of astrometric measurements in
which prior information can be incorporated. This bound can be achieved through
the conditional mean estimator, in contrast to the parametric case where no
unbiased estimator precisely reaches the CR bound.

reliable extrapolation schemes. We show that a finite oscillator basis

spin-orbit coupled materials have shown an in-plane orbital texture switch at
their respective Dirac points, regardless of whether they are topological

demonstrated in a few materials ($\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$,
$\text{Bi}_2\text{Te}_3$, and $\text{BiTeI}$) though DFT calculations. Here we
present a minimal orbital-derived tight binding model to calculate the electron
wave-function in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. We show that the orbital
components of the wave-function demonstrate an orbital-texture switch in
addition to the usual spin switch seen in spin polarized bands. This orbital
texture switch is determined by the existence of three main properties: local
or global inversion symmetry breaking, strong spin-orbit coupling, and
non-local physics (the electrons are on a lattice). Using our model we
demonstrate that the orbital texture switch is ubiquitous and to be expected in
many real systems. The orbital hybridization of the bands is the key aspect for
understanding the unique wave function properties of these materials, and this
minimal model helps to establish the quantum perturbations that drive these
hybridizations.

quasimetric spaces; that is, spaces that do not necessarily satisfy symmetry.
Quasimetric spaces arise naturally from the shortest-path distances on directed
graphs. Perhaps surprisingly, very little is known about low-distortion
embeddings for quasimetric spaces.
  Random embeddings into ultrametric spaces are arguably one of the most
successful geometric tools in the context of algorithm design. We extend this
to the quasimetric case as follows. We show that any $n$-point quasimetric
space supported on a graph of treewidth $t$ admits a random embedding into
quasiultrametric spaces with distortion $O(t \log^2 n)$, where
quasiultrametrics are a natural generalization of ultrametrics. This result
allows us to obtain $t\log^{O(1)} n$-approximation algorithms for the Directed
Non-Bipartite Sparsest-Cut and the Directed Multicut problems on $n$-vertex
graphs of treewidth $t$, with running time polynomial in both $n$ and $t$.
  The above results are obtained by considering a generalization of random
partitions to the quasimetric case, which we refer to as random
quasipartitions. Using this definition and a construction of [Chuzhoy and
Khanna 2009] we derive a polynomial lower bound on the distortion of random
embeddings of general quasimetric spaces into quasiultrametric spaces. Finally,
we establish a lower bound for embedding the shortest-path quasimetric of a
graph $G$ into graphs that exclude $G$ as a minor. This lower bound is used to
show that several embedding results from the metric case do not have natural
analogues in the quasimetric setting.

used to model $X$-point collapse with a guide-field in two and three spatial
dimensions. We show that in a 2D $X$-point collapse with a guide-field close to
the strength of the in-plane field, the increased induced shear flows along the
diffusion region lead to a new reconnection regime in which electron inertial
terms play a dominant role at the $X$-point. This transition is marked by the
emergence of a magnetic island - and hence a second reconnection site - as well
as electron flow vortices moving along the current sheet. The reconnection
electric field at the $X$-point is shown to exceed all lower guide-field cases
for a brief period, indicating a strong burst in reconnection. By extending the
simulation to three spatial dimensions it is shown that the locations of
vortices along the current sheet (visualised by their $Q$-value) vary in the
out-of-plane direction, producing tilted vortex tubes. The vortex tubes on
opposite sides of the diffusion region are tilted in opposite directions,
similarly to bifurcated current sheets in oblique tearing-mode reconnection.
The tilt angles of vortex tubes were compared to a theoretical estimation and
were found to be a good match. Particle velocity distribution functions for
different guide-field runs, for 2.5D and 3D simulations, are analysed and
compared.

decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis
to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies
present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP

potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false
positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait.
This paper introduces the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to the
GWAS analysis of continuous traits. Our parallel implementation of IHT
accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and
graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to
leverage commodity desktop computers in GWAS analysis and to avoid
supercomputing. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS
data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while
remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression. Source

networks (CNN) are widely deployed in mobile devices, data centers, and even
supercomputers. The number of parameters needed in CNNs, however, are often
large and undesirable. Consequently, various methods have been developed to
prune a CNN once it is trained. Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited
benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size
considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute
heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference
speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable
sparsity levels.
  We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed
improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient
general sparse-with-dense matrix multiplication implementation that is
applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity
patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts
sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer
architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1--7.3$\times$
convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon,

traditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model
selection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories
to a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of
classification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2),
which simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover
the system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal
diffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of
pEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition
among several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key
considerations for employing this analysis methodology.

nucleons participating in the overlap region of each nucleus can be unequal due
to nuclear density fluctuations. The asymmetry due to the unequal number of
participating nucleons, referred to as longitudinal asymmetry, causes a shift
in the center of mass rapidity of the participant zone. The information of the
event asymmetry allows us to isolate and study the effect of longitudinal
asymmetry on rapidity distribution of final state particles. In a Monte Carlo
Glauber model the average rapidity-shift is found to be almost linearly related
to the asymmetry. Using toy models, as well as Monte Carlo data for Pb-Pb
collisions at 2.76 TeV generated with HIJING, two different versions of AMPT
and DPMJET models, we demonstrate that the effect of asymmetry on final state
rapidity distribution can be quantitatively related to the average rapidity
shift via a third-order polynomial with a dominantly linear term. The
coefficients of the polynomial are proportional to the rapidity shift with the
dependence being sensitive to the details of the rapidity
distribution.Experimental estimates of the spectator asymmetry through the
measurement of spectator nucleons in a Zero Degree Calorimeter may hence be
used to further constrain the initial conditions in ultra-relativistic

appealing features. Furthermore, by imposing additional constraints on the
system dynamics and network topology, we show that it is possible to construct
a simpler version of the proposed distributed observer that achieves the same

framework allows extensions to time-varying networks that result from
communication losses, and scenarios including faults or attacks at the nodes.

cloud-level, which is dominated by strong east-west jet-streams. These have
been suggested to result from dynamics in a superficial thin weather-layer, or
alternatively be a manifestation of deep interior cylindrical flows. However,
it is possible that the observed winds are indeed superficial, yet there exists
deep flow that is completely decoupled from it. To date, all models linking the
wind, via the induced density anomalies, to the gravity field, to be measured
by Juno, consider only flow that is a projection of the observed could-level
wind. Here we explore the possibility of complex wind dynamics that include
both the shallow weather-layer wind, and a deep flow that is decoupled from the
flow above it. The upper flow is based on the observed cloud-level flow and is
set to decay with depth. The deep flow is constructed to produce cylindrical
structures with variable width and magnitude, thus allowing for a wide range of
possible scenarios for the unknown deep flow. The combined flow is then related
to the density anomalies and gravitational moments via a dynamical model. An
adjoint inverse model is used for optimizing the parameters controlling the
setup of the deep and surface-bound flows, so that these flows can be
reconstructed given a gravity field. We show that the model can be used for
examination of various scenarios, including cases in which the deep flow is
dominating over the surface wind. We discuss extensively the uncertainties
associated with the model solution. The flexibility of the adjoint method
allows for a wide range of dynamical setups, so that when new observations and
physical understanding will arise, these constraints could be easily
implemented and used to better decipher Jupiter flow dynamics.

important to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation

new insights into some aspects of the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF), in spite of
being a purely kinematic description having no reference to plasma phenomena.
It is able to provide a good fit to the experimental current waveforms in at
least 4 large facilities. It has been used for construction of a local
curvilinear frame of reference, in which conservation laws for mass, momentum
and energy can be reduced to effectively-one-dimensional hyperbolic
conservation law equations. Its utility in global parameter optimization of
device parameters has been demonstrated. These features suggest that the
Gratton-Vargas model deserves a closer look at its supposed limitations near
the singular phase of the DPF. This paper presents a discussion of its
development near the device axis, based on the original work of Gratton and
Vargas, with some differences. It is shown that the Gratton-Vargas partial
differential equation has solutions for times after the current singularity,
which exhibit an expanding bounded volume, (which can serve as model of an
expanding plasma column) and decreasing dynamic inductance of the discharge, in
spite of having no built-in hydrodynamics. This enables the model to
qualitatively reproduce the characteristic shape of the current derivative in
DPF experiments without reference to any plasma phenomena such as
instabilities, anomalous resistance or reflection of hydrodynamic shock wave
from the axis. The axial propagation of the solution exhibits a power-law
dependence on the dimensionless time starting from the time of singularity,
which is similar to the power-law relations predicted by theory of point

recently, finding applications in many vision tasks such as multiple object
recognition and automatic image annotation. Associating multiple labels to a
complex image is very difficult, not only due to the intricacy of describing
the image, but also because of the incompleteness nature of the observed
labels. Existing works on the problem either ignore the label-label and
instance-instance correlations or just assume these correlations are linear and
unstructured. Considering that semantic correlations between images are
actually structured, in this paper we propose to incorporate structured
semantic correlations to solve the missing label problem of multi-label
learning. Specifically, we project images to the semantic space with an
effective semantic descriptor. A semantic graph is then constructed on these
images to capture the structured correlations between them. We utilize the
semantic graph Laplacian as a smooth term in the multi-label learning
formulation to incorporate the structured semantic correlations. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic descriptor and
the usefulness of incorporating the structured semantic correlations. We
achieve better results than state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods on

pumping. Many biological fluids and substances are fibrous, having a preferred
direction in their microstructure; for example cervical mucus is formed of
polymer molecules which create an oriented fibrous network. Moreover,
suspensions of elongated motile cells produce a form of active oriented matter.
To understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion, we extend Taylor's
classical model of small-amplitude zero-Reynolds-number propulsion of a
'swimming sheet' via the transversely-isotropic fluid model of Ericksen, which
is linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction. The energetic
costs of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and
the initial fibre angle. Propulsion in a passive transversely-isotropic fluid
produces an enhanced mean rate of working, independent of the initial fibre
orientation, with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the
extensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres. In this
regime the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the Newtonian case. The
effect of the constant term in Ericksen's model for the stress, which can be
identified as a fibre tension or alternatively a stresslet characterising an
active fluid, is also considered. This stress introduces an angular dependence
and dramatically changes the streamlines and flow field; fibres aligned with
the swimming direction increase the energetic demands of the sheet. The
constant fibre stress may result in a reversal of the mean swimming velocity
and a negative mean rate of working if sufficiently large relative to the other
rheological parameters.

proved, and leads to the construction of unitary, symmetric matrices with

  Efficient Posterior Assessment of Dynamic State-Space Model Classes",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods have gained in their
popularity over the last decade because they expand the horizon of Bayesian
parameter inference methods to the range of models for which only forward
simulation is available. The majority of the ABC methods rely on the choice of
a set of summary statistics to reduce the dimension of the data. However, as
has been noted in the ABC literature, the lack of convergence guarantees that
is induced by the absence of a vector of sufficient summary statistics that
assures inter-model sufficiency over the set of competing models, hinders the
use of the usual ABC methods when applied to Bayesian model selection or
assessment. In this paper, we present a novel ABC model selection procedure for
dynamical systems based on a newly appeared multi-level Markov chain Monte
Carlo method, self-regulating ABC-SubSim, and a hierarchical state-space
formulation of dynamic models. We show that this formulation makes it possible
to independently approximate the model evidence required for assessing the
posterior probability of each of the competing models. We also show that
ABC-SubSim not only provides an estimate of the model evidence as a simple
by-product but also it gives the posterior probability of each model as a
function of the tolerance level, which allows the ABC model choices made in
previous studies to be understood. We illustrate the performance of the
proposed framework for ABC model updating and model class selection by applying
it to two problems in Bayesian system identification: a single
degree-of-freedom bilinear hysteretic oscillator and a three-story shear
building with Masing hysteresis, both of which are subject to a seismic
excitation.

question, one should employ the theory of turbulent boundary layer near an
inflexible boundary (e.g., rigid wall). On the basis of this theory, one can
see how the solutions to the Euler equation become relevant for the description
of flow of low-viscosity fluids, and obtain the small parameter quantifying

The Airy operator is a third order differential operator arising in different
contexts, but our main concern is related to its role as the linear part of the
Korteweg-de Vries equation, usually studied on a line or a half-line. The first
problem treated and solved is its correct definition, with different
characterizations, as a skew-adjoint operator on a star graph, a set of lines
connecting at a common vertex representing, for example, a network of branching
channels. A necessary condition turns out to be that the graph is balanced,
i.e. there is the same number of ingoing and outgoing edges at the vertex. The
simplest example is that of the line with a point interaction at the vertex. In
these cases the Airy dynamics is given by a unitary or isometric (in the real
case) group. In particular the analysis provides the complete classification of
boundary conditions giving momentum (i.e., $L^2$-norm of the solution)
preserving evolution on the graph. A second more general problem here solved is
the characterization of conditions under which the Airy operator generates a
contraction semigroup. In this case unbalanced star graphs are allowed. In both
unitary and contraction dynamics, restrictions on admissible boundary
conditions occur if conservation of mass (i.e., integral of the solution) is
further imposed. The above well posedness results can be considered preliminary
to the analysis of nonlinear wave propagation on branching structures.

show a methodology by which we constrain a split-decomposition tree to avoid

optimally-doped BiS2-based superconductor Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2. Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex
samples with x = 0-1 were synthesized. With increasing x, in-plane chemical
pressure is enhanced. For x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1, superconducting transitions with
a large shielding volume fraction are observed in magnetic susceptibility
measurements, and the highest Tc is 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From low-temperature
electrical resistivity measurements, a zero-resistivity state is observed for
all the samples, and the highest Tc is observed for x = 0.8. With increasing Se
concentration, characteristics of electrical resistivity changes from
semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk
superconductivity is linked with the enhanced metallicity. A superconductivity
phase diagram of the Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor is established.
Temperature dependences of electrical resistivity show an anomalous two-step
transition under high magnetic fields. Hence, the resistivity data are analyzed
with assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field.

(CNNs) are utilized to predict bounding boxes of object candidates, and have
gained performance advantages over the traditional region proposal methods.
However, existing deep CNN methods assume the object bounds to be four
independent variables, which could be regressed by the $\ell_2$ loss
separately. Such an oversimplified assumption is contrary to the well-received
observation, that those variables are correlated, resulting to less accurate
localization. To address the issue, we firstly introduce a novel Intersection
over Union ($IoU$) loss function for bounding box prediction, which regresses
the four bounds of a predicted box as a whole unit. By taking the advantages of
$IoU$ loss and deep fully convolutional networks, the UnitBox is introduced,
which performs accurate and efficient localization, shows robust to objects of
varied shapes and scales, and converges fast. We apply UnitBox on face
detection task and achieve the best performance among all published methods on
the FDDB benchmark.

GWs that enter the horizon in matter-dominated era. Results show that the
anisotropic stress reduces the squared amplitude by $ 0.03\%$ for wavelengths,
entering the horizon during matter-dominated phase. This reduction is less for
those wavelengths that enter the horizon at $ \Lambda $ dominated era in flat
spacetime. All of the calculations have been done in closed spacetime and the
results have been compared with the radiation-dominated case for both flat and
closed spacetimes. Finally the paper investigates the effect of closed

water molecules of the TM channel in the active state flow three times slower
than those in the inactive state. Depending on the location in solvent-protein
interface as well as the receptor state, the average residence time of water in
each residue varies from $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ psec to
$\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ nsec. Especially, water molecules, exhibiting ultraslow

the microswitch residues that are considered activity hotspots for GPCR
function. A continuous allosteric network spanning the TM domain, arising from
water-mediated contacts, is unique in the active state, underscoring the
importance of slow waters in the GPCR activation.

glass transition is a subject of intense research. Even after decades of work,
there is still no clear consensus on the molecular mechanisms that lead to a
rapid slowing down of liquid dynamics approaching this putative transition. The
existence of a correlation length associated with amorphous order has recently
been postulated and also been estimated using multi-point correlation functions
which cannot be calculated easily in experiments. Thus the study of growing
amorphous order remains mostly restricted to systems like colloidal glasses and
simulations of model glass-forming liquids. In this Letter, we propose an
experimentally realizable yet simple correlation function to study the growth
of amorphous order. We then demonstrate the validity of this approach for a few
well-studied model supercooled liquids and obtain results which are consistent
with other conventional methods.

delicate interplay between Hund's exchange energy and $t_{2g}-e_g$ crystal
field splitting is responsible for the high spin to low spin state transition
for Co$^{4+}$ ions. The GGA+DMFT calculations show that at small doping level
the Co$^{4+}$ ions adopt high spin state, while delithiation results in
increase of the crystal field splitting and low spin state becomes preferable.

large-format scientific CCDs onboard have been operating at L2. Due to a
combination of the high-precision measurement requirements of the mission and
the predicted proton environment at L2, the effect of non-ionizing radiation
damage on the detectors was early identified pre-launch as potentially imposing
a major limitation on the scientific value of the data. In this paper we
compare pre-flight radiation-induced Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI)
predictions against in-flight measurements, focusing especially on charge
injection diagnostics, as well as correlating these CTI diagnostic results with
solar proton event data. We show that L2-directed solar activity has been
relatively low since launch, and radiation damage (so far) is less than
originally expected. Despite this, there are clear cases of correlation between
earth-directed solar coronal mass ejection events and abrupt changes in CTI
diagnostics over time. These sudden jumps are lying on top of a rather constant
increase in CTI which we show is primarily due to the continuous bombardment of
the devices by high-energy Galactic Cosmic Rays. We examine the possible
reasons for the lower than expected levels of CTI as well as examining the
effect of controlled payload heating events on the CTI diagnostics.
Radiation-induced CTI in the CCD serial registers and effects of ionizing
radiation are also correspondingly lower than expected, however these topics
are not examined here in detail.

not yet been tested experimentally with suffcient accuracy to really determine
whether the perturbative approach is valid. One sensitive test is the
determination of the 1s Lamb Shift in highly-charged very heavy ions. The 1s
Lamb Shift of hydrogen-like lead (Pb81+) and gold (Au78+) has been determined
using the novel detector concept of silicon microcalorimeters for the detection
of hard X-rays. The results of (260 +- 22) eV for lead and (208 +- 13) eV for
gold are within error bars in good agreement with theoretical predictions. For
hydrogen-like lead, this represents the most accurate determination of the 1s
Lamb Shift to our knowledge.

fluorescence with spectral resolution, we diagrammatically derive an analytical
formula for arbitrary-order spectral correlation functions of the scattered
fields that pass through Fabry-Perot interferometers. Our general expression is
then applied to study correlation signals in the limit of well separated
spectral lines of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. In particular, we study
the normalized second-order temporal intensity correlation functions in the
case of the interferometers tuned to the components of the spectrum and obtain
interferential corrections to the approximate results derived in the secular
limit. In addition, we explore purely spectral correlations and show that they
can fully be understood in terms of the two-photon cascades down the dressed
state ladder.

interaction in a stacked two-dimensional ring-network model. The model was
introduced to simulate light propagation in the corresponding ring-resonator
lattice, and is thus completely bosonic. Without these two items, the model
exhibits Floquet-Weyl and Floquet-topological-insulator phases with
topologically gapless and gapped band structures, respectively. The synthetic
magnetic field implemented in the model results in a three-dimensional
Hofstadter-butterfly-type spectrum in a photonic platform. The resulting gaps
are characterization by the winding number of relevant S-matrices together with
the Chern number of the bulk bands. The pseudospin-orbit interaction is defined
as the mixing term between two pseudospin degrees of freedom in the rings,
namely, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes. It destroys the
Floquet-topological-insulator phases, while the Floquet-Weyl phase with
multiple Weyl points can be preserved by breaking the space-inversion symmetry.
Implementing both the synthetic gauge field and pseudospin-orbit interaction
requires a certain nonreciprocity.

algebras in the context of shifted Poisson geometry, i.e. $P_n$-algebras.
Roughly speaking, a coisotropic morphism is given by a $P_{n+1}$-algebra acting
on a $P_n$-algebra. One of our main results is an identification of the space
of such coisotropic structures with the space of Maurer--Cartan elements in a
certain dg Lie algebra of relative polyvector fields. To achieve this goal, we
construct a cofibrant replacement of the operad controlling coisotropic
morphisms by analogy with the Swiss-cheese operad which can be of independent
interest. Finally, we show that morphisms of shifted Poisson algebras are
identified with coisotropic structures on their graph.

(ISGMR) is systematically analyzed in a wide range of masses covering medium,
rare-earth, actinide, and superheavy axial deformed nuclei. The study is
performed within the fully self-consistent quasiparticle
random-phase-approximation (QRPA) method based on the Skyrme functional. Two
Skyrme forces, one with a large (SV-bas) and one with a small (SkP) nuclear
incompressibility, are considered. The calculations confirm earlier results
that, due to the deformation-induced E0-E2 coupling, the isoscalar E0 resonance
attains a double-peak structure and significant energy upshift. Our results are
compared with available analytic estimations. Unlike earlier studies, we get a
smaller energy difference between the lower and upper peaks and thus a stronger
E0-E2 coupling. This in turn results in more pumping of E0 strength into the
lower peak and more pronounced splitting of ISGMR. We also discuss widths of
the peaks and their negligible correlation with deformation.

scattered at small angles from the ATLAS interaction point. To this end, a
combination of 3D Silicon pixel tracking modules and Quartz-Cherenkov
time-of-flight (ToF) detectors is installed 210m away from the interaction
point at both sides of ATLAS. Beam tests with an AFP prototype detector
combining tracking and timing sub-detectors and a common readout have been
performed at the CERN-SPS test-beam facility in November 2014 and September
2015 to complete the system integration and to study the detector performance.
The successful tracking-timing integration was demonstrated. Good tracker hit
efficiencies above 99.9% at a sensor tilt of 14{\deg}, as foreseen for AFP,
were observed. Spatial resolutions in the short pixel direction with 50 {\mu}m
pitch of 5.5 +/- 0.5 {\mu}m per pixel plane and of 2.8 +/- 0.5 {\mu}m for the
full four-plane tracker at 14{\deg} were found, largely surpassing the AFP
requirement of 10 {\mu}m. The timing detector showed also good hit efficiencies
above 99%, and a full-system time resolution of 35 +/- 6 ps was found for the
ToF prototype detector with two Quartz bars in-line (half the final AFP size)
without dedicated optimisation, fulfilling the requirements for initial
low-luminosity AFP runs.

by a phase transition from low to high values of the overall consenus

the emergence of a collective superior intelligence of the population. While
this state being active, a cooling schedule is applied to make agents closer

features, such as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted Excursions, appearing as
high speed jets in the wings of the H$\alpha$ line, are characterized by short
lifetimes and rapid fading without any descending behavior. To study the
theoretical aspects of their stability without considering their formation
mechanism, we model chromospheric jets as twisted magnetic flux tubes moving
along their axis, and use the ideal linear incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
approximation to derive the governing dispersion equation. Analytical solutions
of the dispersion equation indicate that this type of jet is unstable to
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), with a very short (few seconds) instability
growth time at high upflow speeds. The generated vortices and unresolved
turbulent flows associated with the KHI could be observed as broadening of
chromospheric spectral lines. Analysis of the H$\alpha$ line profiles shows
that the detected structures have enhanced line widths with respect to the
background. We also investigate the stability of a larger scale H$\alpha$ jet
that was ejected along the line-of-sight. Vortex-like features, rapidly
developing around the jet's boundary, are considered as evidence of the KHI.
The analysis of the energy equation in the partially ionized plasma shows that
the ion-neutral collisions may lead to the fast heating of the KH vortices over
timescales comparable to the lifetime of chromospheric jets.

taking advantage of adding more computer nodes to a cluster. We thus argue that

picture to match a target picture's color theme. A natural color transfer not
only matches the color styles but also prevents after-transfer artifacts due to
image compression, noise, and gradient smoothness change. The recently
discovered color homography theorem proves that colors across a change in
photometric viewing condition are related by a homography. In this paper, we
propose a color-homography-based color transfer decomposition which encodes
color transfer as a combination of chromaticity shift and shading adjustment. A
powerful form of shading adjustment is shown to be a global shading curve by
which the same shading homography can be applied elsewhere. Our experiments
show that the proposed color transfer decomposition provides a very close
approximation to many popular color transfer methods. The advantage of our
approach is that the learned color transfer can be applied to many other images
(e.g. other frames in a video), instead of a frame-to-frame basis. We
demonstrate two applications for color transfer enhancement and video color
grading re-application. This simple model of color transfer is also important
for future color transfer algorithm design.

vertices of the graph interactions of $\delta$-type can be present and an
overall external potential is admitted. Under general assumptions on the
potential, we prove that the NLS is globally well-posed in the energy domain.
We are interested in minimizing the energy of the system on the manifold of
constant mass ($L^2$-norm). When existing, the minimizer is called ground state
and it is the profile of an orbitally stable standing wave for the NLS
evolution. We prove that a ground state exists for sufficiently small masses
whenever the quadratic part of the energy admits a simple isolated eigenvalue
at the bottom of the spectrum (the linear ground state). This is a wide
generalization of a result previously obtained for a star graph with a single
vertex. The main part of the proof is devoted to prove the concentration
compactness principle for starlike structures; this is non trivial due to the
lack of translation invariance of the domain. Then we show that a minimizing
bounded $H^1$ sequence for the constrained NLS energy with external linear
potentials is in fact convergent if its mass is small enough. Examples are
provided with discussion of hypotheses on the linear part.

Aims. We show that hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the center of the

Methods. We use the asymmetry in the radial velocity distribution of halo stars
due to escaping HVSs, which depends on the halo potential (escape speed) as
long as the round trip orbital time is shorter than the stellar lifetime, to
discriminate between different models for the Milky Way gravitational
potential. Results. Adopting a characteristic HVS travel time of $330$ Myr,

strong young bursts of star formation, implying that their luminosities
experience rapid variations on a time scale of a few Myr. Reducing integrated
characteristics of these galaxies to zero burst age would result in a
considerably tighter and almost linear relation between stellar mass and star
formation rate (SFR). The same correction implies that the specific star
formation rate (the ratio of SFR and stellar mass) is not dependent on the
galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that the correction for rapid luminosity
evolution must be taken into account in a similar way when comparing different

spectral domains at rates much lower than dictated by the Nyquist sampling
theorem. Our prototype realizes an X-band MIMO radar that can be configured to
have a maximum of 8 transmit and 10 receive antenna elements. We use frequency
division multiplexing (FDM) to achieve the orthogonality of MIMO waveforms and
apply the Xampling framework for signal recovery. The prototype also implements
a cognitive transmission scheme where each transmit waveform is restricted to
those pre-determined subbands of the full signal bandwidth that the receiver
samples and processes. Real-time experiments show reasonable recovery
performance while operating as a 4x5 thinned random array wherein the combined
spatial and spectral sampling factor reduction is 87.5% of that of a filled
8x10 array.

exists an auxiliary degree of freedom which can be used to label and
effectively distinguish the two particles. For some types of entanglement
between two indistinguishable particles one can observe duality, i.e., if the
entanglement is present in the Hilbert space H and an auxiliary Hilbert space
H' is used to label the particles, then if we used H as a label the
entanglement would be present in H'. For distinguishable particles this effect
does not occur because of superselection rules which prevent superpositions of
different types of particles. However, it is known that superselection rules
can be bypassed if one uses special auxiliary states that are known as
reference frames. Here we study properties of reference frames which allow for
an observation of a duality in entanglement between two distinguishable
particles. Finally, we discuss the consequences of this result from the
resource-theoretic point of view.

absent control. At any time, one may increase or decrease the content at a cost
proportional to the amount of adjustment. A decrease of the content takes
effect immediately, while an increase is realized after a fixed lead time
$\lt$. Holding costs are incurred continuously over time and are a convex
function of the content. The objective is to find a control policy that
minimizes the expected present value of the total costs. Due to the positive
lead time for upward adjustments, one needs to keep track of all the
outstanding upward adjustments as well as the actual content at time $t$ as
there may also be downward adjustments during $[t,t+\lt)$, i.e., the state of
the system is a function on $[0,\ell]$. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper to study instantaneous control of stochastic systems in such a
functional setting. We first extend the concept of $L^\natural$-convexity to
function spaces and establish the $L^\natural$-convexity of the optimal cost
function. We then derive various properties of the cost function and identify
the structure of the optimal policy as a state-dependent two-sided reflection
mapping making the minimum amount of adjustment necessary to keep the system
states within a certain region.

in films with a thickness above a critical value ($d_{cr}$), which is strongly
determined by the sputtering conditions (i.e. deposition rate, temperature,
magnetic field). So far, $d_{cr}$ has usually been presented as the boundary
between the homogeneous (H) and stripe-domains (SD) regime, respectively below

regime in thin films and microstructured bridges of Py with different
thicknesses. We find there is an intermediate regime, over a quite significant
thickness range below d$_{cr}$, which is signaled in confined structures by a
quickly changing domain-wall configuration and by a broadening of the
magnetoresistance dip at the coercive field. We call this the emerging
stripe-domains (ESD) regime. The transition from the ESD to the SD regime is
accompanied by a sharp increase of the magnetoresistance ratio at the thickness
where stripes appear in MFM.

(detection) and classification of multiple concurrent actions within temporally

appearance and motion detection networks are employed to localise and score
actions from colour images and optical flow. In stage 2, the appearance network
detections are boosted by combining them with the motion detection scores, in
proportion to their respective spatial overlap. In stage 3, sequences of
detection boxes most likely to be associated with a single action instance,
called action tubes, are constructed by solving two energy maximisation
problems via dynamic programming. While in the first pass, action paths
spanning the whole video are built by linking detection boxes over time using
their class-specific scores and their spatial overlap, in the second pass,
temporal trimming is performed by ensuring label consistency for all
constituting detection boxes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm
on the challenging UCF101, J-HMDB-21 and LIRIS-HARL datasets, achieving new
state-of-the-art results across the board and significantly increasing
detection speed at test time. We achieve a huge leap forward in action
detection performance and report a 20% and 11% gain in mAP (mean average

the CBP is cut along the moving direction with a curved slit from the AIA and
SJI images. Then we can obtain the time-distance slices, including the
intensity and intensity-derivative diagrams, from which, the moving structures
are recognized as the oblique streaks, and they are characterized by the
bi-direction, simultaneity, symmetry, and periodicity. The average speed is
around 300 km/s, while the typically period is about 90 s. All these features
(including the bi-directional flows and their periodicity) can be detected
simultaneously at all the 9 wavelengths. This CBP takes place at the site
between a small pair of magnetic polarities. High time resolution observations
show that they are moving close to each other during its lifetime. These facts
support the magnetic reconnection model of the CBP and the bi-directional
moving structures could be the observational outflows after the reconnection.
Therefore, they can be as the direct observation evidence of the magnetic
reconnection.

from multiple saliency models. Previous offline integration methods usually
face two challenges: 1. if most of the candidate saliency models misjudge the
saliency on an image, the integration result will lean heavily on those
inferior candidate models; 2. an unawareness of the ground truth saliency
labels brings difficulty in estimating the expertise of each candidate model.
To address these problems, in this paper, we propose an arbitrator model (AM)

saliency models and the external knowledge into a reference map to effectively
rectify the misleading by candidate models. Secondly, our quest for ways of
estimating the expertise of the saliency models without ground truth labels
gives rise to two distinct online model-expertise estimation methods. Finally,
we derive a Bayesian integration framework to reconcile the saliency models of
varying expertise and the reference map. To extensively evaluate the proposed
AM model, we test twenty-seven state-of-the-art saliency models, covering both
traditional and deep learning ones, on various combinations over four datasets.
The evaluation results show that the AM model improves the performance
substantially compared to the existing state-of-the-art integration methods,

different paths for two-phonon excitation in the NAMR-qubit system with a

that two external driving fields are applied to the NAMR and qubit,

An autocorrelation of the time series was used to select stars presenting
photometric signal stability from a sample of 881 stars with light curves
collected by the $Kepler$ space-borne telescope, in which we have identified 17
stars with stable signals. A simple two-spot model together with a Bayesian
information criterion were applied to these stars in the search for indications
of differential rotation; in addition, for all 17 stars, it was possible to
compute the spot rotation period $P$, the mean values of the individual spot
rotation periods and their respective colatitudes, and the relative amplitude
of the differential rotation.

preprocessing algorithms for deep neural network, we revisit the mean-field
equations (belief-propagation and TAP equations) in the best understood such
machine, namely the Hopfield model of neural networks, and we explicit how they
can be used as iterative message-passing algorithms, providing a fast method to
compute the local polarizations of neurons. In the ""retrieval phase"" where
neurons polarize in the direction of one memorized pattern, we point out a
major difference between the belief propagation and TAP equations : the set of
belief propagation equations depends on the pattern which is retrieved, while
one can use a unique set of TAP equations. This makes the latter method much
better suited for applications in the learning process of restricted Boltzmann
machines. In the case where the patterns memorized in the Hopfield model are
not independent, but are correlated through a combinatorial structure, we show
that the TAP equations have to be modified. This modification can be seen
either as an alteration of the reaction term in TAP equations, or, more
interestingly, as the consequence of message passing on a graphical model with
several hidden layers, where the number of hidden layers depends on the depth
of the correlations in the memorized patterns. This layered structure is
actually necessary when one deals with more general restricted Boltzmann
machines.

to solve in the recent years due to the growth of content in multiple languages
in the Web. One of the standard methods is to use query translation from source
to target language. In this paper, we propose an approach based on word
embeddings, a method that captures contextual clues for a particular word in
the source language and gives those words as translations that occur in a
similar context in the target language. Once we obtain the word embeddings of
the source and target language pairs, we learn a projection from source to
target word embeddings, making use of a dictionary with word translation
pairs.We then propose various methods of query translation and aggregation. The
advantage of this approach is that it does not require the corpora to be
aligned (which is difficult to obtain for resource-scarce languages), a
dictionary with word translation pairs is enough to train the word vectors for
translation. We experiment with Forum for Information Retrieval and Evaluation
(FIRE) 2008 and 2012 datasets for Hindi to English CLIR. The proposed word
embedding based approach outperforms the basic dictionary based approach by 70%
and when the word embeddings are combined with the dictionary, the hybrid
approach beats the baseline dictionary based method by 77%. It outperforms the
English monolingual baseline by 15%, when combined with the translations
obtained from Google Translate and Dictionary.

the losses using a standard distribution is usually very hard and often
impossible due to the specific characteristics of the body and the tail of the
loss distribution. A possible solution is to combine two distributions in a
splicing model: a light-tailed distribution for the body which covers light and
moderate losses, and a heavy-tailed distribution for the tail to capture large
losses. We propose a splicing model with a mixed Erlang (ME) distribution for
the body and a Pareto distribution for the tail. This combines the flexibility
of the ME distribution with the ability of the Pareto distribution to model
extreme values. We extend our splicing approach for censored and/or truncated
data. Relevant examples of such data can be found in financial risk analysis.
We illustrate the flexibility of this splicing model using practical examples

systems with an anharmonic excitation ladder. For a single atom strongly
coupled to an optical cavity, we show that driving the atom gives a decisively
larger optical nonlinearity than driving the cavity. This enhances
single-photon blockade and allows for the implementation of two-photon blockade
where the absorption of two photons suppresses the absorption of further
photons. As a signature, we report on three-photon antibunching with
simultaneous two-photon bunching observed in the light emitted from the cavity.
Our experiment constitutes a significant step towards multi-photon
quantum-nonlinear optics.

instability of a homogeneous solution of a spatially extended multispecies
model, defined on a network. The inherent discreteness of the space makes it
possible to act on the topology of the inter-nodes contacts to achieve the
desired degree of stabilization, without altering the dynamical parameters of
the model. Both symmetric and asymmetric couplings are considered. In this
latter setting the web of contacts is assumed to be balanced, for the
homogeneous equilibrium to exist. The performance of the proposed method are
assessed, assuming the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a reference model.
In this case, the implemented control allows one to stabilize the synchronous
limit cycle, hence time-dependent, uniform solution. A system of coupled real
Ginzburg-Landau equations is also investigated to obtain the topological
stabilization of a homogeneous and constant fixed point.

$\langle e^{-\beta(W-\Delta F)}\rangle = 1$ holds, how to relax this

derive a general expression for the fluctuation relation of the measured work

standard Jarzynski-Sagawa-Ueda relation should be formulated differently. We
again explicitly demonstrate this for an overdamped Brownian particle and a

also demonstrate that the topology of the ground state impacts the dynamics of
the ensuing density waves, and that the instability onset times of Faraday and

corresponds to the event that the target rate exceeds the achievable rate of

some filtering of the raw time-ordered data. Filtering is frequently used to
minimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or
scan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we explicitly
construct a general filtering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set
of unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order
to incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is
mathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal
and unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized
over. We investigate the conditions under which this amended map-making
procedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic
circumstances. We then study the effects of time-domain filtering on the noise
correlation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may have on the
performance of the popular pseudo-spectrum estimators. We conclude that
although maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most
faithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not
straightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the
underlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is
the case. By contrast, simplified map-makers which do not explicitly correct
for time-domain filtering, but leave it to subsequent steps in the data
analysis, may perform equally well and be easier and faster to implement. We
focus on polarization-sensitive measurements targeting the B-mode component of
the CMB signal and apply the proposed methods to realistic simulations based on
characteristics of an actual CMB polarization experiment, POLARBEAR.

between the clusters. $Suzaku$ and $XMM-Newton$ observations revealed that each
cluster hosts gas with moderate temperature of $kT_{1E2216.0-0401}=$4.8$\pm$0.1
keV and $kT_{1E2215.7-0404}=$5.8$\pm$0.2 keV, respectively. On the other hand,
the bridge region shows a remarkably high temperature ({\it kT}=6.6$\pm$0.5
keV). Furthermore, at the position of the bridge, we detected an enhancement in
the wavelet-decomposed soft-band (0.5-4.0 keV) $XMM-Newton$ image at 3 sigma
significance, this is most likely due to a compression of the intracluster
medium (ICM) as a consequence of the merging activity. This X-ray intensity and
temperature enhancement are not consistent with those expected from a late
phase, but are in agreement with the predictions by numerical simulations of an
early phase merger. From the temperature jump at the location of the bridge,
the Mach number is estimated to be ${\cal M}=1.4\pm0.1$, which corresponds to a
shock propagation velocity of about 1570 km/s. From the shock properties, we
estimate that core-passage will occur in 0.3-0.6 Gyr and that the age of the
shock structure is 50--100 Myr. Based on the measured properties of the ICM at
the bridge and estimation of timescales, we find indications for
non-equilibrium ionization. We also discover possible diffuse radio emission
located between the merging clusters. Combining the radio, X-ray, and optical
image data, we speculate that the detected radio sources are most likely
related to the merger event. Thus, 1E2216.0-0401 and 1E2215.7-0404 is a new
example of an early phase cluster merger with remarkable characteristics.

stellar interiors, where their dynamics can have significant impact on
thermo-chemical processes. Investigating the complex dynamics of shear flows
requires numerical calculations that provide a long time evolution of the
system. To achieve a sufficiently long lifetime in a local numerical model the
system has to be forced externally. However, at present, there exist several
different forcing methods to sustain large-scale shear flows in local models.
In this paper we examine and compare various methods used in the literature in
order to resolve their respective applicability and limitations. These
techniques are compared during the exponential growth phase of a shear flow
instability, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, and some are
examined during the subsequent non-linear evolution. A linear stability
analysis provides reference for the growth rate of the most unstable modes in
the system and a detailed analysis of the energetics provides a comprehensive
understanding of the energy exchange during the system's evolution. Finally, we
discuss the pros and cons of each forcing method and their relation with
natural mechanisms generating shear flows.
