three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), by numerically solving the
optical Bloch equations. We focus on the case where there are dark states
because the atom is driven on a ""type-II"" system where the angular momentum of
the excited state, $F'$, is less than or equal to that of the ground state,
$F$. For these systems we find that the force in a three-dimensional light
field has very different behaviour to its one dimensional counterpart. This
differs from the more commonly used ""type-I"" systems ($F'=F+1$) where the 1D
and 3D behaviours are similar. Unlike type-I systems where, for red-detuned
light, both Doppler and sub-Doppler forces damp the atomic motion towards zero
velocity, in type-II systems in 3D, the Doppler force and polarization gradient
force have opposite signs. As a result, the atom is driven towards a non-zero
equilibrium velocity, $v_{0}$, where the two forces cancel. We find that
$v_{0}^{2}$ scales linearly with the intensity of the light and is fairly
insensitive to the detuning from resonance. We also discover a new
magneto-optical force that alters the normal MOT force at low magnetic fields
and whose influence is greatest in the type-II systems. We discuss the
implications of these findings for the laser cooling and magneto-optical
trapping of molecules where type-II transitions are unavoidable in realising
closed optical cycling transitions.

article, we extend this kind of calculus in order to include the semantic of
classical logical operations. We show that this extension to logics is strongly
helped if we submerge the elementary logical calculus in a matrix-vector
formalism that naturally includes a kind of fuzzy-logic. In this way, guided by
the laws of matrix algebra, we can construct compact representations for the
derivatives and the integrals of logical functions. Inside this
semantic-algebraic calculus, we obtain expressions for the derivatives of some
of the basic logical operations and show the general way to obtain the
derivatives of any well-formed formula of propositional calculus. We show that
some of the basic tautologies (Excluded middle, Modus ponens, Hypothetical
syllogism) are members of a kind of hierarchical system linked by the
differentiation algorithm. In addition using the logical derivatives we show
that relatively complex formulas can collapse in simple expressions that reveal
clearly their hidden logical meaning. The search for the antiderivatives
produces naturally an integral calculus. Within this logical formalism an
indefinite integral can always be found for any logical expression. Moreover,
particular integrals can be constructed based on detachment properties that
lead to logical expressions of growing complexity. We show that these
particular integrals have some similarities with the 'generalizing deduction'
procedures investigated by Lukasiewicz.

We find that the tetraquark-type current widely used in the literature for the

enhancement by a factor of 6-7 for the $\bar D D^\ast$ modes compared with the
$Z_c^+\to J/\psi\pi^+$, $\eta_c\rho^+$ modes in agreement with recent

we test a sensitivity of the ratio $R_Z$ of the $Z(4430)^+ \to \psi(2s) \pi^+$

analysis and verification framework and enables the assessment of commonly
accepted data protection goals of privacy. The formalization is based on static
taint analysis and makes flow and processing of privacy-critical data explicit,
globally as well as on the level of individual data subjects. Formally, we show
equivalence to traditional label-based information flow security and prove
overall soundness of our tool with Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate applicability
in two real-world case studies, thereby uncovering previously unknown
violations of privacy constraints in the analyzed software architectures.

(SCTD) is based upon the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition which produces
$r$-rank approximations of data tensors via outer products of vectors in each
dimension of the data. By constraining the vector in the temporal dimension to
known analytic forms which are selected from a large set of candidate
functions, more readily interpretable decompositions are achieved and analytic
time dependencies discovered. The SCTD method circumvents traditional {\em
flattening} techniques where an $N$-way array is reshaped into a matrix in
order to perform a singular value decomposition. A clear advantage of the SCTD
algorithm is its ability to extract transient and intermittent phenomena which
is often difficult for SVD-based methods. We motivate the SCTD method using
several intuitively appealing results before applying it on a number of
high-dimensional, real-world data sets in order to illustrate the efficiency of
the algorithm in extracting interpretable spatio-temporal modes. With the rise
of data-driven discovery methods, the decomposition proposed provides a viable
technique for analyzing multitudes of data in a more comprehensible fashion.

among sampling rate, bitrate, and quadratic distortion in this setting. This
expression is given in terms of a reverse waterfilling formula over the
asymptotic spectral distribution of a sequence of finite-rank operators
associated with the optimal estimator of the Wiener process from its samples.
We show that the ratio between this expression and the standard distortion rate
function of the Wiener process, describing the optimal tradeoff between bitrate
and distortion without a sampling constraint, is only a function of the number
of bits per sample. For example using one bit per sample on average, the
expected distortion is approximately 1.2 times the standard distortion rate
function, indicating a performance loss of about 20% due to sampling. We next
consider the distortion when the continuous-time process is estimated from the
output of an encoder that is optimal with respect to the discrete-time samples.
We show that while the latter is strictly greater than the distortion under
optimal encoding, the ratio between the two does not exceed 1.027. We therefore
conclude that nearly optimal performance is attained even if the encoder is
unaware of the sampling rate and encodes the samples without taking into
account the continuous-time underlying process.

Recently, similar effects (mixed-valence, Kondo fluctuations, heavy Fermi

Eu has a multiple electron (hole) occupancy of its $4f$ shell, and the magnetic
Eu$^{2+}$ state ($4f^7$) has no orbital component in the usual $LS$ coupling
scheme, which can lead to a quite different and interesting physics. In the

varying the Si/Ge ratio, it has been reported that a significant valence
fluctuation can exist even in the magnetic order regime. This paper presents a
detailed study of the latter material using different microscopic probes
(XANES, M\""ossbauer spectroscopy, elastic and inelastic neutron scattering), in
which the composition dependence of the magnetic order and dynamics across the

results support the persistence of valence fluctuations into the

for the fundamental constants, this paper considers stellar models in universes
where $^8$Be is stable. Many previous authors have noted that stars in our
universe would have difficulty producing carbon and other heavy elements in the
absence of the well-known $^{12}$C resonance at 7.6 MeV. This resonance is
necessary because $^8$Be is unstable in our universe, so that carbon must be
produced via the triple alpha reaction to achieve the requisite abundance.
Although a moderate change in the energy of the resonance (200 -- 300 keV) will
indeed affect carbon production, an even smaller change in the binding energy
of beryllium ($\sim100$ keV) would allow $^8$Be to be stable. A stable isotope
with $A=8$ would obviate the need for the triple alpha process in general, and
the $^{12}$C resonance in particular, for carbon production. This paper
explores the possibility that $^8$Be can be stable in other universes. Simple
nuclear considerations indicate that bound states can be realized, with binding
energy $\sim0.1-1$ MeV, if the fundamental constants vary by a $\sim {\rm
few}-10$ percent. In such cases, $^8$Be can be synthesized through helium
burning, and $^{12}$C can be produced later through nuclear burning of
beryllium. This paper focuses on stellar models that burn helium into
beryllium; once the universe in question has a supply of stable beryllium,
carbon production can take place during subsequent evolution in the same star
or in later stellar generations. Using both a semi-analytic stellar structure
model as well as a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code, we find that viable
stellar configurations that produce beryllium exist over a wide range of
parameter space. Finally, we demonstrate that carbon can be produced during
later evolutionary stages.

accuracy and performance. Since finding the optimal configuration of these
parameters is a highly complex task, it extremely common that the software is
used suboptimally. In a typical scenario, accuracy requirements are imposed,
and attained through suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a
methodology for the automatic selection of parameters for simulation codes, and
a corresponding prototype tool. To be amenable to our methodology, the target
code must expose the parameters affecting accuracy and performance, and there
must be formulas available for error bounds and computational complexity of the
underlying methods. As a case study, we consider the particle-particle
particle-mesh method (PPPM) from the LAMMPS suite for molecular dynamics, and
use our tool to identify configurations of the input parameters that achieve a
given accuracy in the shortest execution time. When compared with the
configurations suggested by expert users, the parameters selected by our tool
yield reductions in the time-to-solution ranging between 10% and 60%. In other
words, for the typical scenario where a fixed number of core-hours are granted
and simulations of a fixed number of timesteps are to be run, usage of our tool
may allow up to twice as many simulations. While we develop our ideas using
LAMMPS as computational framework and use the PPPM method for dispersion as
case study, the methodology is general and valid for a range of software tools
and methods.

expect the face of a 40 year old to be more similar to the face of a 30 year
old than to a baby face. We introduce a novel manifold approximation method,
parameterized principal component analysis (PPCA) that models data with linear
subspaces that change continuously according to the extra parameter of
contextual information (e.g. age), instead of ad-hoc atlases. Special care has
been taken in the loss function and the optimization method to encourage
smoothly changing subspaces across the parameter values. The approach ensures
that each observation's projection will share information with observations
that have similar parameter values, but not with observations that have large
parameter differences. We tested PPCA on artificial data based on known, smooth
functions of an added parameter, as well as on three real datasets with
different types of parameters. We compared PPCA to PCA, sparse PCA and to
independent principal component analysis (IPCA), which groups observations by
their parameter values and projects each group using PCA with no sharing of
information for different groups. PPCA recovers the known functions with less
error and projects the datasets' test set observations with consistently less
reconstruction error than IPCA does. In some cases where the manifold is truly
nonlinear, PCA outperforms all the other manifold approximation methods

per site, Wannier functions are $n$-component vector functions of position that
fall off rapidly away from some location, and such that a set of them in some
sense span all states in a given energy band or set of bands;
compactly-supported Wannier functions are such functions that vanish outside a
bounded region. They arise not only in band theory, but also in connection with
tensor-network states for non-interacting fermion systems, and for flat-band
Hamiltonians with strictly short-range hopping matrix elements. In earlier
work, it was proved that for general complex band structures (vector bundles)
or general complex Hamiltonians---that is, class A in the ten-fold
classification of Hamiltonians and band structures---a set of
compactly-supported Wannier functions can span the vector bundle only if the
bundle is topologically trivial, in any dimension $d$ of space, even when use
of an overcomplete set of such functions is permitted. This implied that, for a
free-fermion tensor network state with a non-trivial bundle in class A, any
strictly short-range parent Hamiltonian must be gapless. Here, this result is
extended to all ten symmetry classes of band structures without additional
crystallographic symmetries, with the result that in general the non-trivial
bundles that can arise from compactly-supported Wannier-type functions are
those that may possess, in each of $d$ directions, the non-trivial winding that
can occur in the same symmetry class in one dimension, but nothing else. The
results are obtained from a very natural usage of algebraic $K$-theory, based
on a ring of polynomials in $e^{\pm ik_x}$, $e^{\pm ik_y}$, . . . , which occur
as entries in the Fourier-transformed Wannier functions.

constraint compatible with walking. For an initial value of the wave function
corresponding to a localized configuration at the origin, the probability law
of the first leg of the centipede can be expressed in closed form in terms of

Krapivsky, Luck and Mallick to give rise to ballistic spreading of extremal

growth of the maximal group velocity when the strong constraint is gradually
relaxed is explored, and observed to be linear in the density of gaps allowed

occupancy grid mapping, each cell contains a single number representing the

more importantly inconsistency between the map error and reported confidence

that in addition to achieving maps that are often more accurate than tradition
methods, the proposed filtering scheme demonstrates a much higher level of

planner to reason about acquisition of the future sensory information. Such
planning can lead to active perception maneuvers that while guiding the robot

which is a SAT solver-based cryptanalysis tool for inverting hash functions. We
reduce the hash function inversion problem for fixed targets into the
satisfiability problem for Boolean logic, and use MapleCrypt to construct
preimages for these targets. MapleCrypt has two key features, namely, a
multi-armed bandit based adaptive restart (MABR) policy and a
counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) technique. The MABR
technique uses reinforcement learning to adaptively choose between different
restart policies during the run of the solver. The CEGAR technique abstracts
away certain steps of the input hash function, replacing them with the identity
function, and verifies whether the solution constructed by MapleCrypt indeed
hashes to the previously fixed targets. If it is determined that the solution
produced is spurious, the abstraction is refined until a correct inversion to
the input hash target is produced. We show that the resultant system is faster
for inverting the SHA-1 hash function than state-of-the-art inversion tools.

fluctuations of the stationary asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), run
for some long time $T$, and show that they are of order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a
characteristic line. Upon scaling by $T^{1 / 3}$, we establish that these
fluctuations converge to the long-time height fluctuations of the stationary
KPZ equation, that is, to the Baik-Rains distribution. This result has long
been predicted under the context of KPZ universality and in particular extends
upon a number of results in the field, including the work of Ferrari and Spohn
in 2005 (who established the same result for the TASEP), and the work of Balazs
and Seppalainen in 2010 (who established the $T^{1 / 3}$ scaling for the
general ASEP).
  Second, we introduce a class of translation-invariant Gibbs measures that
characterizes a one-parameter family of slopes for an arbitrary ferroelectric,
symmetric six-vertex model. This family of slopes corresponds to what is known
as the conical singularity (or tricritical point) in the free energy profile
for the ferroelectric six-vertex model. We consider fluctuations of the height
function of this model on a large grid of size $T$ and show that they too are
of order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a certain characteristic line; this confirms a
prediction of Bukman and Shore from 1995 stating that the ferroelectric
six-vertex model should exhibit KPZ growth at the conical singularity.
  Upon scaling the height fluctuations by $T^{1 / 3}$, we again recover the
Baik-Rains distribution in the large $T$ limit. Recasting this statement in
terms of the (asymmetric) stochastic six-vertex model confirms a prediction of
Gwa and Spohn from 1992.

reconstruction of signals and images from a low number of samples. A
particularly exciting application of CS is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
where CS significantly speeds up scan time by requiring far fewer measurements
than standard MRI techniques. Such a reduction in sampling time leads to less
power consumption, less need for patient sedation, and more accurate images.
This accuracy increase is especially pronounced in pediatric MRI where patients
have trouble being still for long scan periods. Although such gains are already
significant, even further improvements can be made by utilizing past MRI scans
of the same patient. Many patients require repeated scans over a period of time
in order to track illnesses and the prior scans can be used as references for
the current image. This allows samples to be taken adaptively, based on both
the prior scan and the current measurements.
  Work by Weizman has shown that so-called reference based adaptive-weighted
temporal Compressed Sensing MRI (LACS-MRI) requires far fewer samples than
standard Compressed Sensing (CS) to achieve the same reconstruction
signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR). The method uses a mixture of reference-based and
adaptive-sampling. In this work, we test this methodology by using various
adaptive sensing schemes, reconstruction methods, and image types. We create a
thorough catalog of reconstruction behavior and success rates that is
interesting from a mathematical point of view and is useful for practitioners.
We also solve a grayscale compensation toy problem that supports the
insensitivity of LACS-MRI to changes in MRI acquisition parameters and thus
showcases the reliability of LACS-MRI in possible clinical situations.

phase transition is presented. The source of gravitational radiation is the
sound waves generated by the explosive growth of bubbles of the stable phase.
The model assumes that the sound waves are linear and that their power spectrum
is determined by the characteristic form of the sound shell around the
expanding bubble. The predicted power spectrum has two length scales, the
average bubble separation and the sound shell width when the bubbles collide.
The peak of the power spectrum is at wavenumbers set by the sound shell width.
For higher wavenumber $k$, the power spectrum decreases as $k^{-3}$. At
wavenumbers below the inverse bubble separation, the power spectrum goes as
$k^5$. For bubble wall speeds near the speed of sound where these two length
scales are distinguished, there is an intermediate $k^{1}$ power law. The
detailed dependence of the power spectrum on the wall speed and the other
parameters of the phase transition raises the possibility of their constraint
or measurement at a future space-based gravitational wave observatory such as
eLISA.

galaxy formation and evolution requires accurate measurements of their
clustering, which can constrain the masses of their host dark matter halos.
Recent work has shown that the clustering measurements of these galaxies may be
affected by a `blending bias,' which results in the angular correlation
function of the sources extracted from single-dish imaging surveys being
boosted relative to that of the underlying galaxies. This is due to confusion
introduced by the coarse angular resolution of the single-dish telescope and
could lead to the inferred halo masses being significantly overestimated. We
investigate the extent to which this bias affects the measurement of the
correlation function of SMGs when it is derived via a cross-correlation with a
more abundant galaxy population. We find that the blending bias is essentially
the same as in the auto-correlation case and conclude that the best way to
reduce its effects is to calculate the angular correlation function using SMGs
in narrow redshift bins. Blending bias causes the inferred host halo masses of
the SMGs to be overestimated by a factor of $\sim6$ when a redshift interval of
$\delta z=3$ is used. However, this reduces to a factor of $\sim2$ for $\delta
z=0.5$. The broadening of photometric redshift probability distributions with
increasing redshift can therefore impart a mild halo `downsizing' effect onto
the inferred host halo masses, though this trend is not as strong as seen in
recent observational studies.

and [alpha/Fe] has recently been proposed as a powerful method to understand
the Galactic thick and thin disk formation. It has been assumed so far that
these mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also coeval, or mono-age,
populations. Here we study this relationship for a Milky Way chemo-dynamical
model and show that equivalence between MAPs and mono-age populations exists
only for the high-[alpha/Fe] tail, where the chemical evolution curves of
different Galactic radii are far apart. At lower [alpha/Fe]-values a MAP is
composed of stars with a range in ages, even for small observational
uncertainties and a small MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation,
for these MAPs younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which
results in negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr/kpc.
Positive radial age gradients can result for MAPs at the lowest [alpha/Fe] and
highest [Fe/H] end. Such variations with age prevent the simple interpretation
of observations for which accurate ages are not available. Studying the
variation with radius of the stellar surface density and scale-height in our
model, we find good agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC)
sample when 1-4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results
suggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for which
mono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational tests for the
validity of our predictions and argue that using accurate age measurements,
such as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting constraints on the
Galactic formation and evolution.

properties of the Galaxy, we explore a set of six initial conditions for the

current position and velocity with respect to the Galactic Center. We find that
the LMC can produce strong disturbances - warping of the stellar and gaseous
discs - in the Galaxy, without violating constraints from the phase-space
distribution of stars in the Solar Neighbourhood. All models correctly
reproduce the phases of the warp and its anti-symmetrical shape about the
disc's mid-plane. If the warp is due to the LMC alone, then the largest mass
model is favoured ($2.5\times10^{11}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$). Still, some
quantitative discrepancies remain, including deficits in height of $\Delta
Z=0.7 \, \rm{kpc}$ at $R=22 \,\rm{kpc}$ and $\Delta Z=0.7\, \rm{kpc}$ at $R=16
\,\rm{kpc}$. This suggests that even higher infall masses for the LMC's halo
are allowed by the data. A comparison with the vertical perturbations induced
by a heavy Sagittarius dSph model ($10^{11}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) suggest that
positive interference with the LMC warp is expected at $R=16 \, \rm{kpc}$. We
conclude that the vertical structure of the Galactic disc beyond the Solar
Neighbourhood may jointly be shaped by its most massive satellites. As such,
the current structure of the MW suggests we are seeing the process of disc
heating by satellite interactions in action.

ground-state and radial excitations, and the radial excitations of vector
mesons. Owing to the fact that the scale-independent leptonic decay constant of
a scalar meson constituted from equal-mass valence-constituents vanishes, it is
found that the PDA of a given scalar system possesses one more zero than that
of an analogous vector meson. Consequently, whereas the mean light-front
relative momentum of the valence-constituents within a vector meson is zero,
that within a scalar meson is large, an outcome which hints at a greater role
for light-front angular momentum in systems classified as $P$-wave in quantum
mechanical models. Values for the scale-dependent decay constants of
ground-state scalar and vector systems are a by-product of this analysis, and
they turn out to be roughly equal, viz. $\simeq 0.2\,$GeV at an hadronic scale.
In addition, it is confirmed that the dilation characterising ground-state PDAs
is manifest in the PDAs of radial excitations too. The impact of
$SU(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking is also considered. When compared with
pseudoscalar states, it is a little stronger in scalar systems, but the size is
nevertheless determined by the flavour-dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking and the PDAs are still skewed toward the heavier valence-quark in

study this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify
its role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the
channel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between
individual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does
not imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply
a type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs. When the CMI is
maximal, we find that the residual channel from an individual input to an
individual output is completely depolarizing when the other input is maximally
mixed. However, we again find that this result is not robust. We also extend
some of these results to the multipartite case and to the case of Haar-random
pure input states. Finally, we look at the relationship between tripartite

out-of-time-order correlation functions. In particular, we demonstrate an

white dwarf (primary) that is accreting matter from a low-mass companion star
(secondary). From time to time such systems undergo large-amplitude
brightenings. The most spectacular eruptions, over $10^4$ times in brightness,
occur in classical novae and are caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the
surface of the white dwarf. Such eruptions are thought to recur on timescales
of $10^4-10^6$. In between, the system's properties depend primarily on the
mass-transfer rate: if it is lower than a $10^{-9} M_{\odot}$/year, the
accretion becomes unstable and the matter is dumped onto the white dwarf during
quasi-periodic dwarf nova outbursts. The hibernation hypothesis predicts that
nova eruptions strongly affect the mass-transfer rate, keeping it high for
centuries after the event. Subsequently, the mass-transfer rate should
significantly decrease for $10^3-10^6$ years, starting the hibernation phase.
After that the nova awakes again - with accretion returning to the pre-eruption
level and leading to a new nova explosion. The hibernation model predicts
cyclical evolution of CVs through phases of high and low mass-transfer. The
theory gained some support from the discovery of ancient nova shells around
dwarf novae Z Cam and AT Cnc, but direct evidence for considerable
mass-transfer changes prior, during and after nova eruptions has not hitherto
been found. Here we report long-term observations of the classical nova V1213
Cen (Nova Cen 2009) covering its pre- and post-eruption phases. Within the six
years before the explosion, the system revealed dwarf nova outbursts indicative
of a low mass-transfer rate. The post-nova is two orders of magnitude brighter
than the pre-nova at minimum light with no trace of dwarf nova behavior,
implying that the mass-transfer rate increased considerably as a result of the
nova explosion.

to follow different spatial distributions; we assume power-law model profiles
and use the model distribution functions described in Evans et al. (1997);
Deason et al (2011, 2012a). We explore the relationships between assumptions
about model parameters and how these assumptions affect mass profile estimates.
We also explore how using subsamples of the GC population beyond certain radii
affect mass estimates. After exploring the posterior distributions of different
parameter assumption scenarios, we conclude that a conservative estimate of the
Galaxy's mass within 125kpc is $5.22\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, with a $50\%$
probability region of $(4.79, 5.63) \times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Extrapolating out
to the virial radius, we obtain a virial mass for the Milky Way of
$6.82\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ with $50\%$ credible region of $(6.06, 7.53)

velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ of the GC population, which is
$\beta=0.28$ with a $50\%$ credible region (0.21, 0.35). Interestingly, the
mass estimates are sensitive to both the dark matter halo potential and visible

samples from the conditional distribution of D restricted to a specified subset

requires only polylogarithmic or even constant number of samples to solve
distribution testing problems like identity and uniformity. This significantly
improves over the standard sampling model where polynomially many samples are

  Inspired by these results, we introduce a computational model based on
conditional sampling to develop sublinear algorithms with exponentially faster

optimization problems over points in high dimensional Euclidean space. Access
to these points is provided via a conditional sampling oracle that takes as
input a succinct representation of a subset of the domain and outputs a
uniformly random point in that subset. We study two well studied problems:
k-means clustering and estimating the weight of the minimum spanning tree. In
contrast to prior algorithms for the classic model, our algorithms have time,
space and sample complexity that is polynomial in the dimension and
polylogarithmic in the number of points.
  Finally, we comment on the applicability of the model and compare with

($\mathrm{Kp = 15.5\,mag}$) $\mathrm{M3.0\pm0.5}$ dwarf from K2's Campaign 5

differences between field-star and cluster planet populations.

based on phylogenetic invariants, alongside the related Markov invariants.
Broadly speaking, both these approaches give rise to polynomial functions of
sequence site patterns that, in expectation value, either vanish for particular
evolutionary trees (in the case of phylogenetic invariants) or have well
understood transformation properties (in the case of Markov invariants). While
both approaches have been valued for their intrinsic mathematical interest, it
is not clear how they relate to each other, and to what extent they can be used
as practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees.
  In this paper, by focusing on the special case of binary sequence data and
quartets of taxa, we are able to view these two different polynomial-based
approaches within a common framework. To motivate the discussion, we present
three desirable statistical properties that we argue any phylogenetic method
should satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input sequences; (2)
stability as the taxa evolve independently according to a Markov process; and
(3) ability to detect if the conditions of a continuous-time process are
violated. Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop and explore
several new phylogenetic inference methods. In particular, we develop a
statistical bias-corrected version of the Markov invariants approach which
satisfies all three properties. We also extend previous work by showing that
the phylogenetic invariants can be implemented in such a way as to satisfy
property (3). A simulation study shows that, in comparison to other methods,
our new proposed approach based on bias-corrected Markov invariants is
extremely powerful for phylogenetic inference.

the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from mini-haloes with $M_{\rm halo}
\le 10^8\,M_\odot$. Our simulations include a new thermo-turbulent star
formation model, non-equilibrium chemistry, and relevant stellar feedback
processes (photoionisation by young massive stars, radiation pressure, and
mechanical supernova explosions). We find that feedback reduces star formation
very efficiently in mini-haloes, resulting in the stellar mass consistent with
the slope and normalisation reported in Kimm \& Cen and the empirical stellar
mass-to-halo mass relation derived in the local Universe. Because star
formation is stochastic and dominated by a few gas clumps, the escape fraction
in mini-haloes is generally determined by radiation feedback (heating due to
photo-ionisation), rather than supernova explosions. We also find that the
photon number-weighted mean escape fraction in mini-haloes is higher
($\sim20$-$40\%$) than that in atomic-cooling haloes, although the
instantaneous fraction in individual haloes varies significantly. The escape
fraction from Pop III stars is found to be significant ($\ge10\%$) only when
the mass is greater than $\sim$100\,\msun. Based on simple analytic
calculations, we show that LyC photons from mini-haloes are, despite their high
escape fractions, of minor importance for reionisation due to inefficient star
formation. We confirm previous claims that stars in atomic-cooling haloes with
masses $10^8\,M_\odot\le M_{\rm halo} \le 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ are likely to be
the most important source of reionisation.

monetary compensation mechanisms that incentivize truth-telling,
self-interested market participants may be inclined to misreport their private

positions in the transmit/receive NULAs. Here the EMG is defined as the number
of signal streams that are practically supported by the channel at a finite
SNR. We first derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic channel
eigenvalues with arbitrarily deployed NULAs when, asymptotically, the
end-to-end distance is sufficiently large compared to the aperture sizes of the
transmit/receive NULAs. Based on the derived expressions, we prove that, the
asymptotically optimal NULA deployment that maximizes the achievable EMG should
follow the groupwise Fekete-point distribution. Specifically, the antennas
should be physically grouped into K separate uniform linear antenna arrays
(ULAs) with the minimum feasible antenna spacing within each ULA, where K is
the target EMG to be achieved; in addition, the centers of these K ULAs follow
the Fekete-point distribution. We numerically verify the asymptotic optimality
of such an NULA deployment and extend it to a groupwise projected arch type
(PAT) NULA deployment, which provides a more practical option for mmWave LoS
MIMO systems with realistic non-asymptotic configurations. Numerical examples
are provided to demonstrate a significant capacity gain of the optimized NULAs
over traditional ULAs.

radial velocity data from McDonald Observatory. For our HST/FGS sample of 15

1.8%. With these and masses from other sources, we construct a V-band MLR for
the lower main sequence with 47 stars, and a K-band MLR with 45 stars with fit

clouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust
growth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the
temperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From
detailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}
measured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average
[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical
constraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that
decreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the
spatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation
in cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is
explained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of
the minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of
a_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and
higher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values. For a_{min} below 3 nm, the
ion-grain interactions enhance the growth rates, steepen the slope of
[Si/H]_{gas}-n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The
rates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust
production by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models. After
the cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, the dust growth
balances the destruction operating on similar timescales of 350 Myr.

learners take as they interact with learning materials and complete exercises
towards comprehension. With this high quantity of sequential data comes the
potential to apply time series models to learn about underlying behavioral
patterns and trends that characterize successful learning based on the granular
record of student actions. There exist several methods for looking at
longitudinal, sequential data like those recorded from learning environments.
In the field of language modelling, traditional n-gram techniques and modern
recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches have been applied to algorithmically
find structure in language and predict the next word given the previous words
in the sentence or paragraph as input. In this paper, we draw an analogy to
this work by treating student sequences of resource views and interactions in a
MOOC as the inputs and predicting students' next interaction as outputs. In
this study, we train only on students who received a certificate of completion.
In doing so, the model could potentially be used for recommendation of
sequences eventually leading to success, as opposed to perpetuating
unproductive behavior. Given that the MOOC used in our study had over 3,500
unique resources, predicting the exact resource that a student will interact
with next might appear to be a difficult classification problem. We find that
simply following the syllabus (built-in structure of the course) gives on
average 23% accuracy in making this prediction, followed by the n-gram method
with 70.4%, and RNN based methods with 72.2%. This research lays the ground

will result in an optimally combined sensitivity curve that is ""white"" from a

of self-assembly. For the problem of \emph{shape construction}, we consider an
extended version of the Two-Handed Tile Assembly Model (2HAM), which contains
positive (attractive) and negative (repulsive) interactions. As a result,
portions of an assembly can become unstable and detach. In this model, we
utilize fuel-efficient computation to perform Turing machine simulations for
the construction of the shape. In this paper, we show how an arbitrary shape
can be constructed using an asymptotically optimal number of distinct tile
types (based on the shape's Kolmogorov complexity). We achieve this at $O(1)$
scale factor in this straightforward model, whereas all previous results with
sublinear scale factors utilize powerful self-assembly models containing
features such as staging, tile deletion, chemical reaction networks, and tile
activation/deactivation. Furthermore, the computation and construction in our
result only creates constant-size garbage assemblies as a byproduct of
assembling the shape.

nature and industry. Some examples are the transport of sand in rivers and
hydrocarbon pipelines. When the shear stresses exerted by a fluid flow on a
granular bed remain moderate, some grains are set in motion without fluidizing
the bed; the moving grains form a layer, known as bed load, that moves while
maintaining contact with the fixed part of the bed. Under bed load conditions,
the granular bed may become unstable, generating ripples and dunes. Sand
ripples are commonly observed in closed conduits and pipes such as in petroleum
pipelines, sewer systems, and dredging lines. Although of importance for many
scientific domains and industrial applications, the formation of ripples in
closed conduits is not well understood, and the problem is still open. This
paper presents an experimental study on the formation and migration of sand
ripples under a turbulent closed-conduit flow and bed-load conditions. In our
experiments, fully-developed turbulent water flows were imposed over a granular
bed of known granulometry in a transparent channel, and bed load took place.
For different water flow rates and grain diameters, the growth and migration of
bedforms were filmed by a high-definition camera, and a numerical code was
developed to determine the wavelength and celerity of the bedforms from the
acquired images. The obtained results are compared with published stability
analyses.

and thus has attracted intensive interest recently. Here, we demonstrate a
systematic study of atomically thin WTe$_{2}$ in its low temperature quantum
electronic transport properties. Strikingly, while the temperature dependence
of few layered WTe$_{2}$ showed clear metallic tendency in the fresh state,
degraded devices first exhibited a re-entrant insulating behavior, and finally
entered a fully insulating state. Correspondingly, a crossover from parabolic
to linear magnetoresistance, and finally to weak anti-localization was seen.
Real-time Raman scattering measurement, together with transmission electron
microscopy studies done before and after air degradation of atomically thin
WTe$_{2}$ further confirmed that the material gradually form amorphous islands.
It thus leads to localized electronic states and explains the low temperature
Coulomb gap observed in transport measurements. Our study reveals for the first
time the correlation between the unusual magnetotransport and disorder in
few-layered WTe$_{2}$, which is indispensable in providing guidance on its
future devices application.

single step of a search algorithm. Quality gain analysis reveals the
dependencies of the quality gain on the parameters of a search algorithm, based
on which one can derive the optimal values for the parameters. In this paper,
we investigate evolution strategies with weighted recombination on general
convex quadratic functions. We derive a bound for the quality gain and two
limit expressions of the quality gain. From the limit expressions, we derive
the optimal recombination weights and the optimal step-size, and find that the
optimal recombination weights are independent of the Hessian of the objective
function. Moreover, the dependencies of the optimal parameters on the dimension
and the population size are revealed. Differently from previous works where the
population size is implicitly assumed to be smaller than the dimension, our
results cover the population size proportional to or greater than the
dimension. Numerical simulation shows that the asymptotically optimal step-size
well approximates the empirically optimal step-size for a finite dimensional
convex quadratic function.

that makes this entanglement transformation process possible. Indeed, this
process can be achieved if and only if the majorization relation $\psi \prec
\phi$ holds, where $\psi$ and $\phi$ are probability vectors obtained by taking
the squares of the Schmidt coefficients of the initial and target states,
respectively. In general, this condition is not fulfilled. However, one can
look for an \textit{approximate} entanglement transformation. Vidal \textit{et.

maximal fidelity between them. Here, we show a strategy to deal with
approximate entanglement transformations based on the properties of the
\textit{majorization lattice}. More precisely, we propose as approximate target
state one whose Schmidt coefficients are given by the supremum between $\psi$

respect the majorization relation in general. Remarkably enough, we find that
for some particular interesting cases, like two-qubit pure states or the

reducing unwanted noise, TV regularization encourages a piecewise constant

sparse boundary regions. In smooth regions however, the solution is not limited
to piecewise constant behavior. We demonstrate that this allows for more
accurate reconstruction of a broader class of images -- even those for which TV
was designed for -- particularly when dealing with pragmatic tomographic

decays linearly in general. The occurrence rate of AFs inside ICMEs is much

interfering with function. However, early in the 20th century, mechanical
engineers found that mechanisms inducing additional vibration in mechanical
systems could prevent sticking and hysteresis. This so-called ""dither"" noise
was later introduced in an entirely different context at the advent of digital
information transmission and recording in the early 1960s. Ironically, the
addition of noise allows one to preserve information that would otherwise be
lost when the signal or image is digitized. As we shall see, the benefits of
added noise in these contexts are closely related to the phenomenon which has
come to be known as stochastic resonance, the original version of which
appealed to noise to explain how small periodic fluctuations in the
eccentricity of the earth's orbit might be amplified in such a way as to bring
about the observed periodic transitions in climate from ice age to temperate
age and back. These noise-induced transitions have since been invoked to
explain a wide array of biological phenomena, including the foraging and
tracking behavior of ants. Many biological phenomena, from foraging to gene
expression, are noisy, involving an element of randomness. In this paper, we
illustrate the general principles behind dithering and stochastic resonance
using examples from image processing, and then show how the constructive use of
noise can carry over to systems found in nature.

a quantum error-correction code and sends it to Arthur, Arthur can correct the
error caused by the noisy channel. If we further assume that Arthur can do only
single-qubit measurements, however, the problem becomes nontrivial, since in
this case Arthur cannot do the universal quantum computation by himself. In
this paper, we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent
to QMA. To show it, we use measurement-based quantum computing: honest Merlin
sends the graph state to Arthur, and Arthur does fault-tolerant
measurement-based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only
single-qubit measurements. By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also
checks the correctness of the graph state. Although this idea itself was
already used in several previous papers, these results cannot be directly used
to the present case, since the test that checks the graph state used in these
papers is so strict that even honest Merlin is rejected with high probability

density. We propose to use \emph{free-energy} derived from Mv.RBM as outlier
score to detect outliers as those data points lying in low density regions. The
method is fast to learn and compute, is scalable to massive datasets. At the

additive constant. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and real-world

the problems are exemplified by means of the explicit Euler box scheme, and
Hamiltonian-preserving discretisations are exemplified by means of the discrete

elastic behavior of skX under applied mechanical forces as well as other

expressed analytically in terms of the thermodynamic parameters describing the
magnetoelastic interaction of the underlying chiral magnet. Through the
deduction of equations, we clarify that two types of coupled deformation may
occur for skX, that is the internal deformation, described by variation of the
Fourier magnitudes, and the lattice deformation, described by the emergent
elastic strains. We also find that besides mechanical loads, bias magnetic
field, spatially periodic magnetic field, spatially periodic mechanical loads,
and emergent stresses can all lead to deformation of the skX. When homogeneous
stresses are applied only, the emergent elastic strains are linearly related to
the elastic strains through the emergent strain ratio matrix {\lambda}. We
calculate {\lambda} for the skX in bulk MnSi and discuss its variation with the
temperature and magnetic field. In particular, we find that all components of
{\lambda} are sensitive to variation of magnetic field b, such that they change
sign as b increases. Moreover, as b approaches the critical magnetic field of
the skX-ferromagnetic phase transition, the dominant components of {\lambda}
diverges. The constitutive equations are of fundamental significance in

we prove that no protocol can guarantee security and liveness in all settings,
we establish conditions for sets of transactions that can safely complete under
secure scheduling. Based on these conditions, we introduce staged commit, a
secure scheduling protocol for federated transactions. This protocol avoids
insecure information channels by dividing transactions into distinct stages. We
implement a compiler that statically checks code to ensure it meets our
conditions, and a system that schedules these transactions using the staged
commit protocol. Experiments on this implementation demonstrate that realistic
federated transactions can be scheduled securely, atomically, and efficiently.

two-dimensional poroviscoelastic model for the mechanical behavior of porous
electrodes is formulated and posed on a geometry corresponding to a thin
rectangular electrode, with a regular square array of microscopic circular
electrode particles, stuck to a rigid base formed by the current collector.
Deformation is forced both by (i) electrolyte absorption driven binder
swelling, and; (ii) cyclic growth and shrinkage of electrode particles as the
battery is charged and discharged. The governing equations are upscaled in
order to obtain macroscopic effective-medium equations. A solution to these
equations is obtained, in the asymptotic limit that the height of the
rectangular electrode is much smaller than its width, that shows the
macroscopic deformation is one-dimensional. The confinement of macroscopic
deformations to one dimension is used to obtain boundary conditions on the
microscopic problem for the deformations in a 'unit cell' centered on a single
electrode particle. The resulting microscale problem is solved using numerical
(finite element) techniques. The two different forcing mechanisms are found to
cause distinctly different patterns of deformation within the microstructure.
Swelling of the binder induces stresses that tend to lead to binder
delamination from the electrode particle surfaces in a direction parallel to
the current collector, whilst cycling causes stresses that tend to lead to
delamination orthogonal to that caused by swelling. The differences between the
cycling-induced damage in both: (i) anodes and cathodes, and; (ii) fast and
slow cycling are discussed. Finally, the model predictions are compared to

temperature. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we consider the
susceptibility as well as the symmetrized spin correlation function (SSCF)
which can be expressed in terms of Green's functions. Thorough investigations
are made on systems embedded in Ohmic or sub-Ohmic bosonic baths. We found the
so-obtained SSCF is the same as that of the non-interacting blip approximation
(NIBA) in unbiased systems while it is applicable for a wider range of
temperature in the biased systems compared with the NIBA. We also show that a
previous perturbation result is recovered as a weak coupling limit of the
so-obtained SSCF. Furthermore, by studying the quantum criticality of the
susceptibility, we confirm the validity of the quantum-toclassical mapping in
the whole sub-Ohmic regime.

rescattered electron trajectories plays unimportant role and the interplay
between the intracycle and inter-cycle results in a ring-like interference
pattern. The ring-like interference pattern will mask the holographic
interference structure in the low longitudinal momentum region. When the
nonadiabatic tunneling contributes significantly to ionization, i.e., the
Keldysh parameter 1, the contribution of the rescattered electron trajectories
become large, thus holographic interference pattern can be clearly observed.

on existing tweet data [43] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also
found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics
performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that
adding point process information to the feature set further improves

prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling

pedestrian evacuation through a narrow exit. To this end, experiments involving
about 80 participants with distinct prescribed behaviours are performed;
reinjection of participants into the setup allowed us to improve the
statistics. Notwithstanding the fluctuations in the instantaneous flow rate, we
find that a stationary regime is almost immediately reached. The average flow
rate increases monotonically with the fraction c\_s of vying (selfish)
pedestrians, which corresponds to a ""faster-is-faster"" effect in our
experimental conditions; it is also positively correlated with the average
density of pedestrians in front of the door, up to nearly close-packing. At
large c\_s , the flow displays marked intermittency, with bursts of
quasi-simultaneous escapes. In addition to these findings, we wonder whether
the effect of cooperation is specific to systems of intelligent beings, or
whether it can be reproduced by a purely mechanical surrogate. To this purpose,
we consider a bidimensional granular flow through an orifice in which some
grains are made ""cooperative"" by repulsive magnetic interactions which impede
their mutual collisions.

data to the cloud prior to computing, called offline prefetching. However, this
approach can potentially result in excessive fetching of large volumes of data
and cause heavy loads on radio-access networks. To solve this problem, the
novel technique of live prefetching is proposed in this paper that seamlessly
integrates the task-level computation prediction and prefetching within the
cloud-computing process of a large program with numerous tasks. The technique
avoids excessive fetching but retains the feature of leveraging prediction to
reduce the program runtime and mobile transmission energy. By modeling the
tasks in an offloaded program as a stochastic sequence, stochastic optimization
is applied to design fetching policies to minimize mobile energy consumption
under a deadline constraint. The policies enable real-time control of the
prefetched-data sizes of candidates for future tasks. For slow fading, the
optimal policy is derived and shown to have a threshold-based structure,
selecting candidate tasks for prefetching and controlling their prefetched data
based on their likelihoods. The result is extended to design close-to-optimal
prefetching policies to fast fading channels. Compared with fetching without
prediction, live prefetching is shown theoretically to always achieve reduction
on mobile energy consumption.

controlling devices for Volt-VAR regulation. These slow controlling devices,
such as capacitors or voltage regulators, cannot be operated frequently and
should be scheduled tens of minutes ahead (Hereafter named as slow control).
Since of the uncertainties in predicting the load and distributed generation,
the voltage violations cannot be eliminated by fast controlling devices with
improper schedule of the slow controlling devices. In this paper we propose
dual time-scale coordination for the Volt-VAR control scheme, corresponding to
slow and fast control. In the case of slow control, a robust voltage and
reactive power optimization model is developed. This guarantees that subsequent
fast controls can maintain the system's voltage security if the uncertain
parameters vary within predefined limits. This nonconvex optimization problem
is relaxed to a mix integer second order conic problem, and the dual form of
its sub-problem is also derived. Then a column-and-constraint generation
algorithm was used to solve the robust convexified model. A conventional
deterministic optimization model can be used to determine the fast control
mechanism. Numerical tests were conducted on a real distribution feeder in
China, a balanced IEEE 69-bus and unbalanced 123-bus benchmark distribution

not always feasible and voltage violation may occur. The robust model was shown
to be effective with respect to all possible scenarios in the uncertainty set,

develop a generic model to study the impact of mating disruption control using
an artificial female pheromone to confuse males and adversely affect their
mating opportunities. Consequently the reproduction rate is diminished leading
to a decline in the population size. For more efficient control, trapping is
used to capture the males attracted to the artificial pheromone. The model,
derived from biological and ecological assumptions, is governed by a system of
ODEs. A theoretical analysis of the model without control is first carried out
to establish the properties of the endemic equilibrium. Then, control is added
and the theoretical analysis of the model enables to identify threshold values
of pheromone which are practically interesting for field applications. In
particular, we show that there is a threshold above which the global asymptotic
stability of the trivial equilibrium is ensured, i.e. the population goes to
extinction. Finally we illustrate the theoretical results via numerical

distant parties via an imperfect optical channel. In this scheme, two copies of
hybrid entangled states are prepared and the continuous-variable parts
propagate through lossy media. In order to perform successful entanglement
swapping, several different measurement schemes are considered for the
continuousvariable parts such as single-photon detection for ideal cases and a
homodyne detection for practical cases. We find that the entanglement swapping
using hybrid states with small amplitudes offers larger entanglement than the
discrete-variable entanglement swapping in the presence of large losses.
Remarkably, this hybrid scheme still offers excellent robustness of
entanglement to the detection inefficiency. Thus, the proposed scheme could be
used for the practical quantum key distribution in hybrid optical states under
photon losses.

  Services for Service Virtualisation","PhD Thesis. Swinburne University of Technology, Australia",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Service virtualisation is a method to create virtual service models that can
mimic interaction behaviors between a system under test and the target system.
With service virtualisation, the development team can get access to the
production-like conditions whenever and however many times they need, enabling
frequent and comprehensive testing. Previous techniques for service
virtualisation have relied on explicitly modelling the target services by a
service expert and require detailed knowledge of message protocol and
structure. However, neither of these are necessarily available.
  In this thesis, we introduce our novel opaque response generation approach.
This approach enables services to be virtualised automatically without any
expert knowledge or documentation of system protocol and interaction
behaviours. Given a collection of interactions exchanged between a system under
test and a target real service, our approach can 1) organise the same type of
interactions into the same cluster and derive a cluster prototype for each
cluster; 2) search a given incoming request for its the most similar request in
the interaction library; 3) learn knowledge from the incoming request and the
recorded interaction; and 4) generate a response. A framework and
proof-of-concept implementation of our opaque response generation approach is
described. Experimental results show our opaque response generation approach is
able to automatically generate accurate responses in real time with an accuracy
rate over 99% on average.

bursts with a long e-folding decay time, ranging from 0.27 to 5.2 hours, since
its launch in 2009 August until 2015 August. The majority of the nine events
were found to originate from transient X-ray sources. The persistent
luminosities of the sources, when these prolonged bursts were observed, were
lower than 1% of the Eddington luminosity for five of them and lower than 20%

MAXI, all but two of which originated from bright persistent sources. The

acoustic and magnetic character. In addition, the thermal structure of sunspots
is very different than that of the quiet Sun. As a consequence, the
interpretation of local helioseismic measurements of sunspots has long been a
challenge. With the aim of understanding these measurements, we carry out
numerical simulations of wave propagation through sunspots. Helioseismic
holography measurements made from the resulting simulated wavefields show
qualitative agreement with observations of real sunspots. We use additional
numerical experiments to determine, separately, the influence of the thermal
structure of the sunspot and the direct effect of the sunspot magnetic field.
We use the ray approximation to show that the travel-time shifts in the thermal
(non-magnetic) sunspot model are primarily produced by changes in the wave path
due to the Wilson depression rather than variations in the wave speed. This
shows that inversions for the subsurface structure of sunspots must account for
local changes in the density. In some ranges of horizontal phase speed and
frequency there is agreement (within the noise level in the simulations)
between the travel times measured in the full magnetic sunspot model and the
thermal model. If this conclusion proves to be robust for a wide range of
models, it would suggest a path towards inversions for sunspot structure.

speculative. For instance the exact composition of the magnetospheric plasma is
not yet known. Is it solely filled with a mixture of $e^\pm$~leptons, or does
it contain a non negligible fraction of protons and/or ions? Actually, is it
almost entirely filled or mostly empty except for some small anecdotal plasma
filled regions? Answers to these questions will strongly direct the description

because of the fact that encoding sparsely distributed coefficients may consume
more bits for representing the index of nonzero coefficients. Therefore,
introducing an accurate rate-constraint in sparse coding and dictionary
learning becomes meaningful, which has not been fully exploited in the context
of sparse representation. According to the Shannon entropy inequality, the
variance of a Gaussian distributed data bounds its entropy, indicating the
actual bitrate can be well estimated by its variance. Hence, a Globally
Variance-Constrained Sparse Representation (GVCSR) model is proposed in this
work, where a variance-constrained rate term is introduced to the optimization
process. Specifically, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the non-convex optimization problem for sparse
coding and dictionary learning, both of them have shown the state-of-the-art
rate-distortion performance for image representation. Furthermore, we
investigate the potential of applying the GVCSR algorithm in the practical
image set compression, where the optimized dictionary is trained to efficiently
represent the images captured in similar scenarios by implicitly utilizing
inter-image correlations. Experimental results have demonstrated superior
rate-distortion performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

black hole evaporation Hawking first introduced a distinctly quantum effect in
nonlinear gravitational physics.Here we show the existence of a general and
universal quantum process whereby a soliton emits quantum radiation with a
specific frequency content, and a temperature given by the number of quanta,
the soliton Schwarzschild radius, and the amount of nonlinearity, in a precise
and surprisingly simple way. This result may ultimately lead to the first
experimental evidence of genuine quantum black hole evaporation. In addition,
our results show that black hole radiation occurs in a fully quantised theory,
at variance with the common approach based on quantum field theory in a curved

findings also have relevance to the entire field of nonlinear waves, including
cold atomic gases and extreme phenomena such as shocks and rogue-waves.

breaking of the mass degeneracy as small as $ \mathcal{O}(10^{-8}) $. The
origin of such a small mass splitting is explained by considering supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking in supergravity, which requires a constant in the
superpotential of the order of the gravitino mass $ m_{3/2} $ to cancel the
cosmological constant. This yields additional terms in the (s)neutrino mass

to learning discriminative SPD matrices with encoding the Riemannian geometry

directly pursuing manifold-manifold transformation matrix of column full-rank.
Specifically, by exploiting the Riemannian geometry of the manifold of
fixed-rank Positive Semidefinite (PSD) matrices, we present a new solution to
reduce optimizing over the space of column full-rank transformation matrices to
optimizing on the PSD manifold which has a well-established Riemannian
structure. Under this solution, we exploit a new supervised SPD similarity
learning technique to learn the transformation by regressing the similarities
of selected SPD data pairs to their ground-truth similarities on the target SPD
manifold. To optimize the proposed objective function, we further derive an
algorithm on the PSD manifold. Evaluations on three visual classification tasks

cause the jet to breakup into drops. The effect of perturbation waves have been
investigated experimentally and found to confirm the essentials of the theory.
However, there is no unanimity about the origin of these perturbation waves.
Recently, the idea of recoil capillary waves as an important source of the
perturbation waves has been emphasized. The recoil of the end point of the
remaining continuous jet at its breakup point is considered to travel upward as
a recoil capillary wave which gets reflected at the mouth of the nozzle from
which the jet originates. The reflected capillary wave travels along the jet
downward with its Doppler shifted wavelength as a perturbation wave. We set up

$r_0\approx 25$ mag at 50% completeness level has allowed accurate measurements
of its photometric and structural properties. The color-magnitude diagram of
Peg III confirms that the stellar system is well described by an old
($\gtrsim12$ Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-2.0$ dex) stellar population
at a heliocentric distance of $215\pm12$ kpc. The revised half-light radius
$r_{h}=53\pm14$ pc, ellipticity $\epsilon=0.38^{+0.22}_{-0.38}$, and total
luminosity $M_{V}=-3.4\pm0.4$ are in good agreement with the values quoted in
our previous paper. We further report on the spectroscopic identification of
seven, possibly eight member stars of Peg III. The Ca II triplet lines of the
brightest member stars indicate that Peg III contains stars with metallicity as
low as [Fe/H]=$-2.55\pm0.15$ dex. Peg III has a systemic velocity of $-222.9
\pm 2.6$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity dispersion of $5.4^{+3.0}_{-2.5}$ km
s$^{-1}$. The inferred dynamical mass within the half-light radius is
$1.4^{+3.0}_{-1.1} \times 10^6\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and the mass-to-light ratio
$\rm{M/L}$$_{V} = 1470^{+5660}_{-1240}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}}$, providing
further evidence that Peg III is a dwarf galaxy satellite. We find that Peg III
and another distant dwarf satellite Pisces II lie relatively close to each
other ($\Delta d_{spatial}=43\pm19$ kpc) and share similar radial velocities in
the Galactic standard-of-rest frame ($\Delta v_{GSR}=12.3\pm3.7$ km s$^{-1}$).
This suggests that they may share a common origin.

spatially distributed brain regions. In this context, noninvasive M/EEG source
connectivity is an emerging technique to identify functional brain networks at

effect of the two key factors involved in EEG source connectivity processing:
i) the algorithm used in the solution of the EEG inverse problem and ii) the
method used in the estimation of the functional connectivity. We evaluate four
inverse solutions algorithms and four connectivity measures on data simulated
from a combined biophysical/physiological model to generate realistic
interictal epileptic spikes reflected in scalp EEG. We use a new network-based
similarity index (SI) to compare between the network identified by each of the
inverse/connectivity combination and the original network generated in the
model. The method will be also applied on real data recorded from one epileptic
patient who underwent a full presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant focal
epilepsy. In simulated data, results revealed that the selection of the
inverse/connectivity combination has a significant impact on the identified
networks. Results suggested that nonlinear methods for measuring the
connectivity are more efficient than the linear one. The wMNE inverse solution
showed higher performance than dSPM, cMEM and sLORETA. In real data, the
combination (wMNE/PLV) led to a very good matching between the interictal
epileptic network identified from noninvasive EEG recordings and the network
obtained from connectivity analysis of intracerebral EEG recordings. These
results suggest that source connectivity method, when appropriately configured,
is able to extract highly relevant diagnostic information about networks
involved in interictal epileptic spikes from non-invasive dense-EEG data.

rise in the last decades to an active and interdisciplinary field of study.
Such behaviors are often modeled by active matter, in which each individual is
self-driven and tends to update its velocity depending on the one of its
neighbors.
  In a classical model introduced by Vicsek and al., as well as in numerous
related active matter models, a phase transition between chaotic behavior at
high temperature and global order at low temperature can be observed. Even
though ample evidence of these phase transitions has been obtained for
collective dynamics, from a mathematical standpoint, such active systems are
not fully understood yet. Significant progress has been achieved in the recent
years under an assumption of mean-field interactions, however to this day, few
rigorous results have been obtained for models involving purely local
interactions.
  In this paper, as a first step towards the mathematical understanding of
active microscopic dynamics, we describe a lattice active particle system, in
which particles interact locally to align their velocities. We obtain
rigorously, using the formalism developed for hydrodynamic limits of lattice
gases, the scaling limit of this out-of-equilibrium system.

work we study how a nonzero mass of charged particles, which are degenerate
relativistic electrons and nonrelativistic protons, influences the generation
of the magnetic field in frames of this approach. For this purpose we calculate
the induced electric current of these charged particles, electroweakly
interacting with background neutrons and an external magnetic field, exactly
accounting for the particle mass. This current is calculated by two methods:
using the exact solution of the Dirac equation for a charged particle in
external fields and computing the polarization operator of a photon in matter
composed of background neutrons. We show that the induced current is vanishing
in both approaches leading to the zero contribution of massive particles to the

evolution, the pion momentum spectrum and elliptic flow change little for
granular sources with and without viscosity. On the other hand, the influence
of viscosity on HBT radius $R_{\rm out}$ is considerable. It makes $R_{\rm
out}$ decrease in the granular source model. We determine the model parameters
of granular sources using the experimental data of pion transverse-momentum
spectrum, elliptic flow, and HBT radii together, and investigate the effects of
viscosity on the model parameters. The results indicate that the granular
source model may reproduce the experimental data of pion transverse-momentum
spectrum, elliptic flow, and HBT radii in heavy-ion collisions of Au-Au at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV in different
centrality intervals. The viscosity of the droplet leads to an increase in the
initial droplet radius and a decrease of the source shell parameter in the
granular source model.

difficulty in supporting the increased traffic demand with rigid, fixed

for spontaneous large-scale events that require service providers to augment
capacity of their networks quickly. Today, the use of aerial devices equipped
with high-rate radio access capabilities has the potential to offer the much
needed ""on-demand"" capacity boost. Conversely, it also threatens to rattle the
long-standing business strategies of wireless operators, especially as the
""gold rush"" for cheaper millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum lowers the market
entry barriers. However, the intricate structure of this new market presently
remains a mystery. This paper sheds light on competition and cooperation
behavior of dissimilar aerial mmWave access suppliers, concurrently employing
licensed and license-exempt frequency bands, by modeling it as a vertically
differentiated market where customers have varying preferences in price and
quality. To understand viable service provider strategies, we begin with
constructing the Nash equilibrium for the initial market competition by
employing the Bertrand and Cournot games. We then conduct a unique assessment
of short-term market dynamics, where two licensed-band service providers may
cooperate to improve their competition positions against the unlicensed-band
counterpart intruding the market. Our unprecedented analysis studies the
effects of various market interactions, price-driven demand evolution, and
dynamic profit balance in this novel type of ecosystem.

  From the analysis of the mass-ratio distribution for the cluster binary

are thus candidate post-mass-transfer systems. Among these candidates which
occupy the same locus as the barium and S stars in the (P-e) diagram, only 33%
(= 4/12) show a chemical signature of mass transfer in the form of s-process
overabundances (from rather moderate -- about 0.3 dex -- to more extreme --
about 1 dex). These s-process-enriched cluster stars show a clear tendency to
be in the clusters with the lowest metallicity in the sample, confirming the
classical prediction that the s-process nucleosynthesis is more efficient at
low metallicities (the only strong barium star in our sample is found in the
cluster with the lowest metallicity, i.e., star 173 in NGC 2420, with [Fe/H] =
-0.26). The s-process overabundance is not clearly correlated with the cluster
turnoff (TO) mass (such a correlation would instead hint at the importance of
the dilution factor). We find as well a mild barium star in NGC 2335, a cluster
with a large TO mass of 4.3 Msun, which implies that intermediate-mass AGB
stars still operate the s-process and the third dredge-up.

slope of the radial iron gradient of the young red-giant population

Cepheid measurements. For stellar populations with ages of $1-4$ Gyr the

and then flattens again to reach a value of $\sim-0.03$ dex/kpc for stars with
ages between 6 and 10 Gyr. Our results are in good agreement with a
state-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the evolution of the
abundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely explained by a non-varying
negative metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium, together with stellar
radial heating and migration. We also offer an explanation for why
intermediate-age open clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood can be more
metal-rich, and why their radial metallicity gradient seems to be much steeper
than that of the youngest clusters. Already within 2 Gyr, radial mixing can
bring metal-rich clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to
Galactocentric radii of 5 to 8 kpc. We suggest that these outward-migrating
clusters may be less prone to tidal disruption and therefore steepen the local
intermediate-age cluster metallicity gradient. Our scenario also explains why
the strong steepening of the local iron gradient with age is not seen in field
stars. In the near future, asteroseismic data from the K2 mission will allow
for improved statistics and a better coverage of the inner-disc regions,
thereby providing tighter constraints on the evolution of the central parts of
the Milky Way.

that while the product method remains valid under standard assumptions in the

fails to be collapsible upon marginalizing over the mediator. This will
invariably be the case for most choices of mediator and outcome error
distributions. A notable exception arises in case of normal mediator-normal

mapping study in the [O I] lines of OMC-2 FIR 3 and FIR 4, two of the most
luminous protostars in Orion outside of the Orion Nebula. The spatial
morphology of the fine structure line emission reveals the presence of an
extended photodissociation region (PDR) and a narrow, but intense jet
connecting the two protostars. The jet seen in [O I] emission is spatially
aligned with the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron jet and the CO (6-5) molecular outflow
centered on FIR 3. The mass loss rate derived from the total [O I] 63 micron
line luminosity of the jet is 7.7 x 10^-6 M_sun/yr, more than an order of
magnitude higher than that measured for typical low mass class 0 protostars.
The implied accretion luminosity is significantly higher than the observed
bolometric luminosity of FIR 4, indicating that the [O I] jet is unlikely to be
associated with FIR 4. We argue that the peak line emission seen toward FIR 4
originates in the terminal shock produced by the jet driven by FIR 3. The
higher mass-loss rate that we find for FIR 3 is consistent with the idea that
intermediate mass protostars drive more powerful jets than their low-mass
counterparts. Our results also call into question the nature of FIR 4.

indicators, $T_{\rm{bol}}$ and $L_{\rm {bol}}/L_{\rm {smm}}$. FIR CO emission
from protostars traces the currently shocked gas by jets/outflows, and $L^{\rm

$\dot{M}_{\rm{out}}$. The correlation between $L^{\rm fir}_{\rm CO}$ and
$L_{\rm{bol}}$ is indicative of instantaneous $\dot{M}_{\rm{out}}$ tracking

are consistent with mass accretion/ejection in protostars being episodic. Taken
together with the previous finding that the time-averaged mass
ejection/accretion rate declines during the protostellar phase (e.g., Bontemps
et al. 1996), our results suggest that the instantaneous accretion/ejection
rate of protostars is highly time variable and episodic, but the amplitude
and/or frequency of this variability decreases with time such that the time

capable to determine those unknown oscillations and corresponding amplitudes.
The technique can identify vibrational dephasing and decrease damping and

Static models based on quasi-static approximation are common approaches for DBS
modeling. While this simplification has been validated for bioelectric sources,
its application to rapid stimulation pulses, which contain more high-frequency
power, may not be appropriate, as DBS therapeutic results depend on stimulus
parameters such as frequency and pulse width, which are related to time
variations of the electric field. We propose an alternative hybrid approach
based on probabilistic models and differential equations, by using Gaussian
processes and wave equation. Our model avoids quasi-static approximation,
moreover, it is able to describe dynamic behavior of DBS. Therefore, the
proposed model may be used to obtain a more realistic phenomenon description.
The proposed model can also solve inverse problems, i.e. to recover the
corresponding source of excitation, given electric potential distribution. The
electric potential produced by a time-varying source was predicted using
proposed model. For static sources, the electric potential produced by
different electrode configurations were modeled. Four different sources of
excitation were recovered by solving the inverse problem. We compare our
outcomes with the electric potential obtained by solving Poisson's equation
using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Our approach is able to take into
account time variations of the source and the produced field. Also, inverse
problem can be addressed using the proposed model. The electric potential
calculated with the proposed model is close to the potential obtained by

approach to deriving the Laplace transform of the reciprocal of the SIR and use
it to characterize the distribution of the SIR. Our main findings show that the
closed-form expression of the distribution of the SIR can be obtained whenever
the receive signal power has an Erlang distribution, and an almost closed-form
expression can be found if the power-law pathloss model has a pathloss exponent
of four. In the second part of this paper, we aim to apply the derived
distribution of the SIR in finding the two important performance metrics: the
success probability and ergodic link capacity. For each type of the RXs, the
success probability with (without) interference cancellation and that with
(without) the proposed stochastic power control are found in a compact form.
With the aid of the derived Shannon transform identity, the ergodic link
capacities of K-type RXs are derived with low complexity, and they can be
applied to many transmitting scenarios, such as multi-antenna communication and
stochastic power control. Finally, we analyze the spatial throughput capacity

Planning has drawn much attention in recent work in the robotics and sequential
decision making areas. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an
agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to
planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g.
graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to
learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt
parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types
of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or
Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these
popular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of
learning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these
models is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and
underestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the
agent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is
not a suitable model.
  More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
can compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where
the partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic
performance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP. In
general, finding the optimal policy for the POMDP model is computationally
intractable and fully non convex, even for the class of memoryless policies.
The open problem is to come up with a method to find an exact or an approximate
optimal stochastic memoryless policy for POMDP models.

hole solutions that can be equipped with a hair by conformally coupling the
theory to a real scalar field. This is a secondary hair, meaning that it does
not endow the black hole with new quantum numbers. It rather consists of a
non-trivial scalar field profile of fixed intensity which turns out to be
regular everywhere outside and on the horizon and, provided the cosmological
constant is negative, behaves at large distance in a way compatible with the
Anti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic. In this paper, we review the main features of
these hairy black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamical
properties. The conformal coupling to matter in dimension $D>4$ in principle
includes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained from the Lovelock
action through the Stueckelberg strategy. As a consequence, the resulting
scalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality under field redefinition that
resembles T-duality. Through this field redefinition, the matter content of the
theory transforms into a Lovelock action for a dual geometry. Since the hairy
black holes only exist for special relations between the dual Lovelock coupling
constants, it is natural to compare those relations with the causality bounds
coming from AdS/CFT. We observe that, while the lower causality bound is always
obeyed, the upper causality bound is violated. The latter, however, is
saturated in the large $D$ limit.

relative likelihoods of two events when both events are arbitrarily rare. Each
period, either a blue die or a red die is tossed. The two dice land on side $1$
with unknown probabilities $p_1$ and $q_1$, which can be arbitrarily low. Given
a data-generating process where $p_1\ge c q_1$, we are interested in how much
data is required to guarantee that with high probability the observer's
Bayesian posterior mean for $p_1$ exceeds $(1-\delta)c$ times that for $q_1$.
If the prior densities for the two dice are positive on the interior of the
parameter space and behave like power functions at the boundary, then for every
$\epsilon>0,$ there exists a finite $N$ so that the observer obtains such an
inference after $n$ periods with probability at least $1-\epsilon$ whenever
$np_1\ge N$. The condition on $n$ and $p_1$ is the best possible. The result
can fail if one of the prior densities converges to zero exponentially fast at

major driving force in solid-state physics. As a new state of matter, a Weyl
semimetal (WSM), particularly a type-II WSM, hosts Weyl fermions as emergent
quasiparticles and may harbor novel electrical transport properties because of
the exotic Fermi surface. Nevertheless, such a type-II WSM material has not
been experimentally observed in nature. In this work, by performing systematic
magneto-transport studies on thin films of a predicted material candidate WTe2,
we observe notable angle-sensitive (between the electric and magnetic fields)
negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR), which can likely be attributed to
the chiral anomaly in WSM. This phenomenon also exhibits strong planar
orientation dependence with the absence of negative longitudinal MR along the
tungsten chains (a axis), which is consistent with the distinctive feature of a
type-II WSM. By applying a gate voltage, we demonstrate that the Fermi energy
can be tuned through the Weyl points via the electric field effect; this is the
first report of controlling the unique transport properties in situ in a WSM
system. Our results have important implications for investigating simulated
quantum field theory in solid-state systems and may open opportunities for
implementing new types of electronic applications, such as field-effect chiral
electronic devices.

resources while effecting voltage regulation. The design of energy management
schemes is challenging, one of the reasons being that energy management is a
multistage problem where decisions are not all made at the same timescale and
must account for the variability during real-time operation. The joint dispatch
of slow- and fast-timescale controls in a smart distribution grid is considered
here. The substation voltage, the energy exchanged with a main grid, and the
generation schedules for small diesel generators have to be decided on a slow
timescale; whereas optimal photovoltaic inverter setpoints are found on a more
frequent basis. While inverter and looser voltage regulation limits are imposed
at all times, tighter bus voltage constraints are enforced on the average or in
probability, thus enabling more efficient renewable integration. Upon
reformulating the two-stage grid dispatch as a stochastic convex-concave
problem, two distribution-free schemes are put forth. An average dispatch
algorithm converges provably to the optimal two-stage decisions via a sequence
of convex quadratic programs. Its non-convex probabilistic alternative entails
solving two slightly different convex problems and is numerically shown to
converge. Numerical tests on a real-world distribution feeder verify that both
novel data-driven schemes yield lower costs over competing alternatives.

replicating an existing one would afford a distribution of group sizes with a
power-law tail. Here, we show that, in fact, Simon's model does not produce a
simple power law size distribution as the initial element has a dominant
