lepton-proton scattering when the beam's energy is comparable to the mass of
the lepton. The future MUSE experiment, which is devised to solve the ""Proton
Radius Puzzle"", is going to cover the corresponding kinematic region for a
scattering of muons by a proton target. We anticipate that helicity-flip meson
exchanges will make a difference in comparison of elastic electron-proton
versus muon-proton scattering in MUSE. In this article, we estimate the
$\sigma$ meson exchange contribution in the $t$-channel. This contribution,
mediated by two-photon coupling of $\sigma$, is calculated to be at most $\sim
0.1 \%$ for muons in the kinematics of MUSE and it is about 3 orders in
magnitude larger than for electrons because of the lepton-mass difference.

sensitive to electron recoils can detect such particles with masses between a
few eV to more than 10 keV. For dark photon dark matter, we update a previous
bound based on XENON10 data and derive new bounds based on data from XENON100
and CDMSlite. We find these experiments to disfavor previously allowed
parameter space. Moreover, we derive sensitivity projections for SuperCDMS at
SNOLAB for silicon and germanium targets, as well as for various possible
experiments with scintillating targets (cesium iodide, sodium iodide, and
gallium arsenide). The projected sensitivity can probe large new regions of
parameter space. For axion-like particles, the same current direction detection
data improves on previously known direct-detection constraints but does not
bound new parameter space beyond known stellar cooling bounds. However,
projected sensitivities of the upcoming SuperCDMS SNOLAB using germanium can go
beyond these and even probe parameter space consistent with possible hints from
the white dwarf luminosity function. We find similar results for dark photons
from the sun. For all cases, direct-detection experiments can have
unprecedented sensitivity to dark-sector particles.

in metallic bilayers consisting of a heavy-metal (HM) and a ferromagnetic metal

observed when reversing the direction of either the applied in-plane current or
the magnetization. We attribute such nonlinear transport behavior to the
spin-polarization dependence of the electron mobility in the FM layer acting in
concert with the spin accumulation induced in that layer by the spin Hall
current originating in the bulk of the HM layer. An explicit expression for the
nonlinear magnetoresistance is derived based on a simple drift-diffusion model,
which shows that the nonlinear magnetoresistance appears at the first order of
spin Hall angle (SHA), and changes sign when the current is reversed, in
agreement with the experimental observations. We also discuss possible ways to
control the sign of the nonlinear magnetoresistance and to enhance the

zero potential energy. Further, we study the eigenmodes around the kink and

show that there are large velocity gradients across the width of each eyelid,

flows inward until its radial streaming slows down abruptly and the gas piles
up in the eyelids. The radial compression at the eyelids causes an increase in
the gas column density by direct radial impact and also leads to a high rate of
shear. We find a strong correlation between the molecular column densities and
the magnitude of dv/dR across the width of the eyelid at fixed values of
azimuth. Substantial portions of the eyelids have high velocity dispersion in

are local but under suitable conditions the dynamics is reversible with a
Gibbsian like invariant measure with long range interactions. We discuss
geometrically the conditions of reversibility on a ring that correspond to a
gradient condition on the graph of configurations or equivalently to a
divergence free condition on a graph structure associated to the types of
particles. We show that much of the information on the interactions between
particles can be encoded in associated \emph{Tournaments} that are a special
class of oriented directed graphs. In particular we show that the interactions
of reversible models are corresponding to strongly connected tournaments. The
possible minimizers of the energies are in correspondence with the Hamiltonian
cycles of the tournaments. We can then determine how many and which are the
possible minimizers of the energy looking at the structure of the associated
tournament. As a byproduct we obtain a probabilistic proof of a classic Theorem
of Camion \cite{Camion} on the existence of Hamiltonian cycles for strongly
connected tournaments. Using these results we obtain in the case of an equal
number of k types of particles new representations of the Hamiltonians in terms
of translation invariant $k$-body long range interactions. We show that when
$k=3,4$ the minimizer of the energy is always unique up to translations.
Starting from the case $k=5$ it is possible to have more than one minimizer. In
particular it is possible to have minimizers for which particles of the same

  Guesswork",,,,,"cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern authentication systems store hashed values of passwords of users using
cryptographic hash functions. Therefore, to crack a password an attacker needs
to guess a hash function input that is mapped to the hashed value, as opposed
to the password itself. We call a hash function that maps the same number of
inputs to each bin, as \textbf{unbiased}. However, cryptographic hash functions
in use have not been proven to be unbiased (i.e., they may have an unequal
number of inputs mapped to different bins). A cryptographic hash function has
the property that it is computationally difficult to find an input mapped to a
bin. In this work we introduce a structured notion of biased hash functions for
which we analyze the average guesswork under certain types of brute force
attacks. This work shows that the level of security depends on the set of
hashed values of valid users as well as the statistical profile of a hash
function, resulting from bias. We examine the average guesswork conditioned on
the set of hashed values, and model the statistical profile through the
empirical distribution of the number of inputs that are mapped to a bin. In
particular, we focus on a class of statistical profiles (capturing the bias) ,
which we call type-class statistical profiles, that has an empirical
distribution related to the probability of the type classes defined in the
method of types. For such profiles, we show that the average guesswork is
related to basic measures in information theory such as entropy and divergence.
We use this to show that the effect of bias on the conditional average
guesswork is limited compared to other system parameters such as the number of
valid users who store their hashed passwords in the system.

We outline LBCS (the LOFAR Long-Baseline Calibrator Survey),
whose aim is to identify sources suitable for calibrating the
highest-resolution observations made with the International LOFAR Telescope,
which include baselines >1000 km. Suitable sources must contain significant
correlated flux density (50-100mJy) at frequencies around 110--190~MHz on
scales of a few hundred mas. At least for the 200--300-km international
baselines, we find around 1 suitable calibrator source per square degree over a
large part of the northern sky, in agreement with previous work. This should
allow a randomly selected target to be successfully phase calibrated on the
international baselines in over 50% of cases. Products of the survey include
calibrator source lists and fringe-rate and delay maps of wide areas --
typically a few degrees -- around each source. The density of sources with
significant correlated flux declines noticeably with baseline length over the
range 200--600~km, with good calibrators on the longest baselines appearing
only at the rate of 0.5 per square degree. Coherence times decrease from 1--3
minutes on 200-km baselines to about 1 minute on 600-km baselines, suggesting
that ionospheric phase variations contain components with scales of a few
hundred kilometres. The longest median coherence time, at just over 3 minutes,
is seen on the DE609 baseline, which at 227km is close to being the shortest.
We see median coherence times of between 80 and 110 seconds on the four longest
baselines (580--600~km), and about 2 minutes for the other baselines. The
success of phase transfer from calibrator to target is shown to be influenced
by distance, in a manner that suggests a coherence patch at 150-MHz of the
order of 1 degree.

used to calculate the leading contributions to the total isotope shift for
commonly occurring isotopologs of each species. Computed quantities include
diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (mass shifts) and isotopic field shifts.
Mass shifts dominate for light nuclei up to and including K, but field shifts
contribute significantly for Rb and Sr and are dominant for Yb. We compare the
{\em ab initio} mass-shift functions for Li$_2$, LiK and LiRb with
spectroscopically derived ground-state BOB functions from the literature. We
find good agreement in the values of the functions for LiK and LiRb at their
equilibrium geometries, but significant disagreement with the shapes of the
functions for all 3 systems. The differences may be due to contributions of
nonadiabatic terms to the empirical BOB functions. We present a semiclassical
model for the effect of BOB corrections on the binding energies of
near-threshold states and the positions of zero-energy Feshbach resonances.

Training specific OCR models was possible because the necessary *ground truth*
is available as error-corrected diplomatic transcriptions. The OCR results have
been evaluated for accuracy against the ground truth of unseen test sets.
Character and word accuracies (percentage of correctly recognized items) for
the resulting machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94% to
more than 99% (character level) and from 76% to 97% (word level). This includes
the earliest printed books, which were thought to be inaccessible by OCR

corpus consisting of books with different printing dates and different typesets
*(mixed models)* have been tested for their predictive power on the books from
the other part containing yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies
well above 90%. It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models
trained on a range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical
printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of some
pages will then enable the training of individual models with even better
accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early printings can
be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual transcription. The OCR

We show that Higgs decays to four leptons are sensitive, via tree level/1-loop

$\lambda_{WZ}$. Determining this sign requires interference effects, as it is
nearly impossible to measure with rate information. Furthermore, simply
determining the sign effectively establishes the custodial representation of

other measurements of the Higgs boson couplings and, in particular, largely
free of assumptions about the top quark Yukawa couplings which also enter at

1987A, covering the last 16 years, are presented. We find that the 0.5-2 keV
light curve has remained constant at ~8x10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 since 9500 days,
with the 3-8 keV light curve continuing to increase until at least 10000 days.
The expansion rate of the ring is found to be energy dependent, such that after
day 6000 the ring expands faster in the 2-10 keV band than it does at energies
<2 keV. Images show a reversal of the east-west asymmetry between 7000 and 8000
days after the explosion. The latest images suggest the southeastern side of
the equatorial ring is beginning to fade. Consistent with the latest optical
and infrared results, our Chandra analysis indicates the blast wave is now
leaving the dense equatorial ring, which marks the beginning of a major change
in the evolutionary phase of the supernova remnant 1987A.

dominated by the curvaton condensate, making it impossible to match

of the inflaton to curvaton to be less than of order $0.1$ typically. If the

A new component of emission suddenly appears in the pulse profile, decays over

own strengths and weaknesses. Although there is a problem of drive asymmetry in
the cylindrical hohlraums due to some non-ideal factors, the success of
ignition is still possible if more laser energy is available beyond the US

provide the high symmetry flux on capsule. However, octahedral hohlraums suffer
from several problems due to the complicated three-dimensional plasma

octahedral hohlraums in which each problem can be solved at the same time.
Six-cylinder-port hohlraums combine the merits in theory of both cylindrical

good performance by using the six-cylinder-port hohlraums, in which the key
issues of concern, such as laser energy, drive symmetry, and laser plasma

manipulate is multi-rigid body simulation with rigid contact. This paradigm
provides reasonable tradeoffs between accuracy, running time, and simplicity of
parameter selection and identification. The Stewart-Trinkle/Anitescu-Potra time
stepping approach is the basis of many existing implementations. It
successfully treats inconsistent (Painleve-type) contact configurations,
efficiently handles many contact events occurring in short time intervals, and
provably converges to the solution of the continuous time differential
algebraic equations (DAEs) as the integration step size tends to zero. However,
there is currently no means to determine when the solution has largely
converged, i.e., when smaller integration steps would result in only small
increases in accuracy.
  The present work describes an approach that computes the event times (when
the set of active equations in a DAE changes) of all contact/impact events for
a multi-body simulation, toward using integration techniques with error control
to compute a solution with desired accuracy.
  We also describe a first-order, variable integration approach that ensures
that rigid bodies with convex polytopic geometries never interpenetrate. This
approach permits taking large steps when possible and takes small steps when
contact is complex.

intensive research efforts on human action recognition. Since human actions can
be characterized by multiple feature representations extracted from Kinect and

optimal for human action recognition. In this paper, we propose a new
unsupervised feature fusion method termed Multiview Cauchy Estimator Feature
Embedding (MCEFE) for human action recognition. By minimizing empirical risk,
MCEFE integrates the encoded complementary information in multiple views to
find the unified data representation and the projection matrices. To enhance
robustness to outliers, the Cauchy estimator is imposed on the reconstruction
error. Furthermore, ensemble manifold regularization is enforced on the
projection matrices to encode the correlations between different views and
avoid overfitting. Experiments are conducted on the new Chinese Academy of

to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MCEFE for human action

aspects of such networks, i.e., multi-hop connectivity, channel heterogeneity

delay-bound-based algorithms for transmit power minimization and network
lifetime maximization of multi-hop heterogeneous wireless networks using our
previously developed stochastic network calculus approach for performance
analysis of a cascade of buffered wireless fading channels. Our analysis shows
an overall transmit power saving of up to 95% compared to a fixed power
allocation scheme when using a service model in terms of the Shannon capacity
limit. For a more realistic set-up, we evaluate the performance of the
suggested algorithm in a WirelessHART network, which is a widely used
communication standard for process automation and other industrial
applications. We find that link heterogeneity can significantly reduce network
lifetime when no efficient power management is applied. Moreover, we show,
using extensive simulation study, that the proposed bound-based power
allocation performs reasonably well compared to the real optimum, especially in
the case of WirelessHART networks.

semantic annotations for 25 thousand images synthesized by a photorealistic
open-world computer game. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets show
that using the acquired data to supplement real-world images significantly
increases accuracy and that the acquired data enables reducing the amount of
hand-labeled real-world data: models trained with game data and just 1/3 of the
CamVid training set outperform models trained on the complete CamVid training

interpretation of knowledge representations, and their structure, as a semantic
system, within the framework of promise theory. By assigning interpretations to
phenomena, from observers to observed, we may approach a simple description of
knowledge-based functional systems, with direct practical utility. The focus is
especially on the interpretation of concepts, associative knowledge, and
context awareness. The inference seems to be that most if not all of these
concepts emerge from purely semantic spacetime properties, which opens the
possibility for a more generalized understanding of what constitutes a
learning, or even `intelligent' system.
  Some key principles emerge for effective knowledge representation: 1)
separation of spacetime scales, 2) the recurrence of four irreducible types of
association, by which intent propagates: aggregation, causation, cooperation,
and similarity, 3) the need for discrimination of identities (discrete), which
is assisted by distinguishing timeline simultaneity from sequential events, and
4) the ability to learn (memory). It is at least plausible that emergent
knowledge abstraction capabilities have their origin in basic spacetime
structures.
  These notes present a unified view of mostly well-known results; they allow
us to see information models, knowledge representations, machine learning, and
semantic networking (transport and information base) in a common framework. The
notion of `smart spaces' thus encompasses artificial systems as well as living
systems, across many different scales, e.g. smart cities and organizations.

Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful
in this context. This study proposes a simple statistical learning approach to
predict political bias from text. Standard text features extracted from
speeches and manifestos of political parties are used to predict political bias
in terms of political party affiliation and in terms of political views.
Results indicate that political bias can be predicted with above chance
accuracy. Mistakes of the model can be interpreted with respect to changes of
policies of political actors. Two approaches are presented to make the results
more interpretable: a) discriminative text features are related to the
political orientation of a party and b) sentiment features of texts are
correlated with a measure of political power. Political power appears to be
strongly correlated with positive sentiment of a text. To highlight some
potential use cases a web application shows how the model can be used for texts

SQ oracle} for the input distribution $D$ instead of i.i.d.~ samples from $D$.
Given a query function $\phi:X \rightarrow [-1,1]$, the oracle returns an
estimate of ${\bf E}_{ x\sim D}[\phi(x)]$ within some tolerance $\tau_\phi$
that roughly corresponds to the number of samples.
  In this work we demonstrate that the complexity of solving general problems
over distributions using SQ algorithms can be captured by a relatively simple
notion of statistical dimension that we introduce. SQ algorithms capture a
broad spectrum of algorithmic approaches used in theory and practice, most
notably, convex optimization techniques. Hence our statistical dimension allows
to investigate the power of a variety of algorithmic approaches by analyzing a
single linear-algebraic parameter. Such characterizations were investigated
over the past 20 years in learning theory but prior characterizations are
restricted to the much simpler setting of classification problems relative to a
fixed distribution on the domain (Blum et al., 1994; Bshouty and Feldman, 2002;

resolved structure with a resolution of a few milliarcsecond (mas), and the
total recovered flux density is comparable to that measured in earlier

supergravity theories, a Horndeski theory, and a theory of quintessence. These
orbits lie in what we shall call a photon sphere (anti-photon sphere) if the
orbit is unstable (stable). We show that in all the asymptotically flat
solutions we examine that admit a regular event horizon, and whose
energy-momentum tensor satisfies the strong energy condition, there is one and
only one photon sphere outside the event horizon. We give an example of a
Horndeski theory black hole (whose energy-momentum tensor violates the strong
energy condition) whose metric admits both a photon sphere and an anti-photon
sphere. The uniqueness and non-existence also holds for asymptotically anti-de
Sitter solutions in gauged supergravity. The latter also exhibit the projective
symmetry that was first discovered for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics: the
unparameterised null geodesics are the same as when the cosmological or gauge
coupling constant vanishes. We also study the closely related problem of
accretion flows by perfect fluids in these metrics. For a radiation fluid,
Bondi's sonic horizon coincides with the photon sphere. For a general
polytropic equation of state this is not the case. Finally we exhibit
counterexamples to a conjecture of Hod's.

elusive is a microscopic framework that explains the macroscopic flow, derived

experiments on compressed emulsions and numerical simulations, we unravel that
the primary microscopic mechanisms for flow are strongly influenced by the rate
of the imposed deformation. When shearing fast, small coordinated clusters of
droplets move collectively as in a conga line, while at low rates the flow
emerges from bursts of droplet rearrangements, correlated over large domains.
These regions exhibit complex spatio-temporal correlation patterns that reflect
the long range elasticity embedded in the jammed material. These results
identify the three-dimensional structure of microscopic rearrangements within
sheared soft solids, revealing that the characteristic shape and dynamics of
these structures are strongly determined by the rate of the external shear.

describes persistence of velocities over a characteristic spatial scale, unlike
classical random walk methods, which model persistence over a characteristic

velocities for both equidistant and isochrone sampling along streamlines, under
transient and stationary conditions. Based on this, we develop a space
continuous CTRW approach for the spatial and temporal dynamics of Lagrangian

velocity statistics, the proposed approach quantifies the evolution of the
Lagrangian velocity statistics under both stationary and non-stationary

statistics, and determine the behaviors of the mean particle velocity, velocity
covariance and particle dispersion. We find strong Lagrangian correlation and
anomalous dispersion for velocity distributions which are tailed toward low

there can appear a state where some coherence lengths are larger and some are
smaller than the magnetic field penetration length $\lambda$: $\xi_1\leq

abilities and capabilities in using resources. The proposed framework bridges
two - up to now - mutually independent strands of literature: the one on logics
of abilities and capabilities, developed within the theory of agency, and the
one on logics of resources, motivated by program semantics. The logic LRC is
suitable to describe and reason about key aspects of social behaviour in
organizations. We prove a number of properties enjoyed by LRC (soundness,
completeness, canonicity, disjunction property) and its associated analytic
calculus (conservativity, cut elimination and subformula property). These
results lay at the intersection of the algebraic theory of unified
correspondence and the theory of multi-type calculi in structural proof theory.
Case studies are discussed which showcase several ways in which this framework
can be extended and enriched while retaining its basic properties, so as to
model an array of issues, both practically and theoretically relevant, spanning
from planning problems to the logical foundations of the theory of
organizations.

well-known models of fractional evolution. They can be constructed as standard
Poisson processes with the time variable replaced by a stable subordinator and
its inverse, respectively. The aim of this paper is to study non-homogeneous
versions of such models, which can be defined by means of the so-called
multistable subordinator (a jump process with non-stationary increments),

two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, a number
of phenomena were imaged, including electron flow from a quantum point contact,

  Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convex regression (CR) is an approach for fitting a convex function to a
finite number of observations. It arises in various applications from diverse
fields such as statistics, operations research, economics, and electrical
engineering. The least squares (LS) estimator, which can be computed via
solving a quadratic program (QP), is an intuitive method for convex regression
with already established strong theoretical guarantees. On the other hand,
since the number of constraints in the QP formulation increases quadratically
in the number of observed data points, the QP quickly becomes impractical to
solve using traditional interior point methods. To address this issue, we
propose a first-order method based on dual smoothing that carefully manages the
memory usage through parallelization in order to efficiently compute the LS
estimator in practice for large-scale CR instances.

beyond and claim that the brain does not only adapt to its surrounding reality
but rather, it builds itself up to constructs its own reality. That is, rather
than just trying to passively understand its environment, the brain is the
architect of its own reality in an active process where its internal models of
the external world frame how its new interactions with the environment are
assimilated. These internal models represent relevant predictive patterns of
interaction all over the different brain structures: perceptual, sensorimotor,
motor, etc. The emergence of adaptive behavior arises from this
self-constructive nature of the brain, based on the following principles of
organization: self-experimental, self- growing, and self-repairing.
Self-experimental, since to ensure survival, the self-constructive brain (SCB)
is an active machine capable of performing experiments of its own interactions
with the environment by mental simulation. Self-growing, since it dynamically
and incrementally constructs internal structures in order to build a model of
the world as it gathers statistics from its interactions with the environment.
Self-repairing, since to survive the SCB must also be robust and capable of
finding ways to repair parts of previously working structures and hence
re-construct a previous relevant pattern of activity.

related to several interesting phenomena. In particular, previous calculations
have shown that fast rotating neutron stars, when subjected to a quark-hadron
phase transition in their interiors, could give rise to the backbending
phenomenon characterized by a spin-up era. In this work, we use an equation of
state composed of two phases, containing nucleons (and leptons) and quarks. The
hadronic phase is described in a relativistic mean field formalism that takes
many-body forces into account, and the quark phase is described by the MIT bag
model with a vector interaction. Stationary and axi-symmetric stellar models
are obtained in a self-consistent way by solving numerically the
Einstein-Maxwell equations by means of a pseudo-spectral method. As a result,
we obtain the interesting backbending phenomenon for fast spinning neutron
stars. More importantly, we show that a magnetic field, which is assumed to be
axi-symmetric and poloidal, can also be enhanced due to the phase transition
from normal hadronic matter to quark matter on highly magnetized neutron stars.
Therefore, in parallel to the spin-up era, classes of neutron stars endowed
with strong magnetic fields may go through a ""magnetic-up era"" in their lives.

the lowest possible production of heat and simultaneously at the fastest
possible time-scale is a new challenge in fundamental magnetism [1-4] as well
as an increasingly important issue in modern information technology [5]. Recent
results demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch
magnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized
laser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the
switching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong
optical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature
[9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in
transparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly
polarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable
magnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the
polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net
magnetization in the garnet, write ""0"" and ""1"" magnetic bits at will. This
mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read
magnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load
(< 6 J/cm3).
