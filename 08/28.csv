one-dimensional hard rods is computed using state-of-the-art quantum Monte
Carlo and analytic continuation techniques, complemented by a Bethe Ansatz
analysis. As the density increases, $S(q,\omega)$ reveals a crossover from the
Tonks-Girardeau gas to a quasi-solid regime, along which the low-energy
properties are found in agreement with the nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory.
Our quantitative estimate of $S(q,\omega)$ extends beyond the low-energy limit
and confirms a theoretical prediction regarding the behavior of $S(q,\omega)$
at specific wavevectors $\mathcal{Q}_n=n 2 \pi/a$, where $a$ is the core
radius, resulting from the interplay of the particle-hole boundaries of
suitably rescaled ideal Fermi gases. We observe significant similarities
between hard rods and one-dimensional $^4$He at high density, suggesting that
the hard-rods model may provide an accurate description of dense
one-dimensional liquids of quantum particles interacting through a strongly
repulsive, finite-range potential.

found in industrial applications. A better knowledge of it, is of importance to
improve particle related industrial processes. When shear stresses exerted by
the fluid on the bed of particles are bounded to some limits, a mobile layer of
particles known as bed-load takes place in which the particles stay in contact
with the fixed bed. If it takes place over a non-erodible ground, and if the
particle flow rate is small enough, an initial thin continuous layer of
particles becomes discontinuous and composed of isolated dunes. We present here
an experimental study to understand some features of the dynamics of isolated
dunes under a fluid flow using a closed-conduit experimental loop made of
transparent material. Acquired data concerns mainly dune morphology and
displacement velocity under different conditions: different types of beads
(diameters and densities) and different water flow conditions. We observed that
an initial pile of beads placed in the conduit is rapidly deformed by the water
flow, adopting a ""croissant"" shape, like barchan dunes found in deserts at a
much larger scale. We observed also self-similarity in dunes dimensions and
that dune displacement velocity scales with the inverse of their dimensions.
The variation of the dune displacement velocity with the fluid shear velocity
is discussed here.

phones or on desktops. End users of these applications range from novice to
expert depending on how experienced they are in using them. With repeated usage
(practice) of an application, a user's think time gradually decreases, known as
learning phenomenon. In contrast to the popular notion of constant mean think
time of users across all practice sessions, decrease in mean think time over
practice sessions does occur due to learning. This decrease gives rise to a
different system workload thereby affecting the application's short-term
performance. However, such impact of learning on performance has never been
accounted for. In this work we propose a model that accounts for human learning
behavior in analyzing the transient (short-term) performance of a 3-tier cloud
based application. Our approach is based on a closed queueing network model. We
solve the model using discrete event simulation. In addition to the overall
mean System Response Time (SRT), our model solution also generates the mean
SRTs for various types (novice, intermediate, expert) of requests submitted by
users at various levels of their expertise. We demonstrate that our model can
be used to evaluate various what-if scenarios to decide the number of VMs we
need for each tier-a VM configuration-that would meet the response time SLA.
The results show that the lack of accountability of learning may lead to a
selection of an inappropriate VM configuration. The results further show that
the mean SRTs for various types of requests are better measures to consider in
VM allocation process in comparison to the overall mean SRT.

(StOps) as defined and studied in the monograph, ""Global Methods for
Combinatorial Isoperimetric Problems"" (GMCIP). StOps are morphisms for
combinatorial isoperimetric problems, analogous to Steiner symmetrization for
continuous isoperimetric problems. The usefulness of a StOp, Phi, a function
from the power set of V (a finite set) to the power set of V, depends on having
an efficient representation of its range. In GMCIP the problem was treated
case-by-case. In each case the StOp induced a partial order, P, on V so that
Range(Phi)=I(P), the set of all order ideals of P. Here we show (directly from
the axioms for a StOp) that every idempotent StOp admits such a representation
of its range (P is then called the StOp-order of Phi). That result leads to
another question: What additional structure does Range(Phi) have? The answer is
none. We show that every finite poset is the StOp-order of some idempotent
Steiner operation.

market return distributions is modelled by a Fokker-Plank (FP) equation either
with a linear drift and a nonlinear diffusion term or with just a nonlinear

solution. The distributions obtained from current estimated parameters are
compared with the solutions of the FP equations. For negligible drift term, the
inverse mean square deviations (betaFP) from the FP model follow a power law
with exponent values between -1.25 and -1.48 indicating superdiffusion. When
the drift term is non-negligible, the corresponding betaFP do not follow a

on the values of the drift parameter and q. Neither of these behaviors is
supported by the results of the empirical fit.

  paper and also corrects several errors",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the difficulty of repairing defect, many research efforts have been
devoted into automatic defect repair. Given a buggy program that fails some
test cases, a typical automatic repair technique tries to modify the program to
make all tests pass. However, since the test suites in real world projects are
usually insufficient, aiming at passing the test suites often leads to
incorrect patches.
  In this paper we aim to produce precise patches, that is, any patch we
produce has a relatively high probability to be correct. More concretely, we
focus on condition synthesis, which was shown to be able to repair more than
half of the defects in existing approaches. Our key insight is threefold.
First, it is important to know what variables in a local context should be used
in an ""if"" condition, and we propose a sorting method based on the dependency
relations between variables. Second, we observe that the API document can be
used to guide the repair process, and propose document analysis technique to
further filter the variables. Third, it is important to know what predicates
should be performed on the set of variables, and we propose to mine a set of
frequently used predicates in similar contexts from existing projects.
  We develop a novel program repair system, ACS, that could generate precise
conditions at faulty locations. Furthermore, given the generated conditions are
very precise, we can perform a repair operation that is previously deemed to be
too overfitting: directly returning the test oracle to repair the defect. Using
our approach, we successfully repaired 17 defects on four projects of
Defects4J, which is the largest number of fully automatically repaired defects
reported on the dataset so far. More importantly, the precision of our approach
in the evaluation is 73.9%, which is significantly higher than previous
approaches, which are usually less than 40%.

in many other Cu-based double-perovskites is absent in our samples, which may
be due to the existence of weak Cu-Ir exchange interaction. First-principle
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations show canted antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order in both Cu$^{2+}$ and Ir$^{4+}$ sublattices, which gives rise to
weak ferromagnetism. Electronic structure calculations suggest that
La$_2$CuIrO$_6$ is an SOC-driven Mott insulator with an energy gap of $\sim$
0.3 eV. Sr-doping decreases the magnetic ordering temperatures ($T_N$ and
$T_C$) and suppresses the electrical resistivity. The high temperatures
resistivity can be fitted using a variable-range-hopping model, consistent with
the existence of disorders in these double-pervoskite compounds.

fundamental to a wide range of applications, examples of which include soft

these problems is the non-local Cahn-Hilliard (a.k.a. Ohta-Kawasaki) framework.
In this work, we study the emergence of spatially localized states in both the

(i) asymmetries in long-range Coulomb interactions that are manifested by
differences in the dielectric response, and (ii) asymmetric short-range
interactions that correspond to differences in the chemical potential between
two materials phases. It is shown that in one space dimension (1D) there is a
multiplicity of coexisting localized solutions, which organize in the
homoclinic snaking structure, bearing similarity to dissipative systems. In
addition, an analysis of 2D extension is performed and distinct instability
mechanisms (related to extended and localized modes) of localized stripes are
discussed with respect to model parameters and domain size. Finally,
implications to localized hexagonal patterns are also made. The insights
provide an efficient mechanistic framework to design and control localized
self-assembly that might be a plausible strategy for low cost of nano

effective dynamics, we investigate the phenomenological differences between the
two quantizations for the single fluid and the two fluid scenarios with various
equations of state, including the phantom matter. We show that a striking
difference between the two quantizations is the existence of two distinct
quantum turnarounds, either bounces or recollapses, in the connection
quantization, in contrast to a single distinct quantum bounce or a recollapse
in the holonomy quantization. These results generalize an earlier result on the
existence of two distinct quantum bounces for stiff matter by Corichi and
Karami. However, we find that in certain situations two distinct quantum
turnarounds can become virtually indistinguishable. And depending on the
initial conditions, a pure quantum cyclic universe can also exist undergoing a
quantum bounce and a quantum recollapse. We show that for various equations of
states, connection based quantization leads to super-Planckian values of the
energy density and the expansion scalar at quantum turnarounds. Interestingly,
we find that very extreme energy densities can also occur for the holonomy
quantization, breaching the maximum allowed density in the spatially flat loop
quantized model. However, the expansion scalar in all these cases is bounded by
a universal value.

depends on uncertainties (variances) in inputs and then identifies which inputs

determination in output is the most crucial step in sensitivity analysis. In
the present paper, an analytic expression, which can exactly evaluate the
uncertainty in output as a function of the output's derivatives and inputs'
central moments, is firstly deduced for general multivariate models with given
relationship between output and inputs in terms of Taylor series expansion. A
$\gamma$-order relative uncertainty for output, denoted by
$\mathrm{R^{\gamma}_v}$, is introduced to quantify the contributions of input
uncertainty of different orders. On this basis, it is shown that the widely
used approximation considering the first order contribution from the variance
of input variable can satisfactorily express the output uncertainty only when
the input variance is very small or the input-output function is almost linear.
Two applications of the analytic formula are performed to the power grid and
economic systems where the sensitivity of both actual power output and Economic
Order Quantity models are analyzed. The importance of each input variable in
response to the model outputs is quantified by the analytic formula.

understand the formation process of star clusters. Pre-main sequence (PMS)
stars in nearby young open clusters reveal a large spread in brightness. If the
spread were considered as a result of a real spread in age, the corresponding
cluster formation timescale would be about 5 -- 20 Myr. Hence it could be
interpreted that star formation in an open cluster is prolonged for up to a few
tens of Myr. However, difficulties in reddening correction, observational
errors, and systematic uncertainties introduced by imperfect evolutionary
models for PMS stars, can result in an artificial age spread. Alternatively, we
can utilize Li abundance as a relative age indicator of PMS star to determine
the cluster formation timescale. The optical spectra of 134 PMS stars in NGC
2264 have been obtained with MMT/Hectochelle. The equivalent widths have been
measured for 86 PMS stars with a detectable Li line (3500 < T_eff [K] <= 6500).
Li abundance under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was
derived using the conventional curve of growth method. After correction for
non-LTE effects, we find that the initial Li abundance of NGC 2264 is A(Li) =
3.2 +/- 0.2. From the distribution of the Li abundances, the underlying age
spread of the visible PMS stars is estimated to be about 3 -- 4 Myr and this,

respect to traditional radar array systems in terms of flexibility and
performance. However, MIMO radar poses new challenges for both hardware design
and digital processing. In particular, achieving high azimuth resolution
requires a large number of transmit and receive antennas. In addition, the
digital processing is performed on samples of the received signal, from each
transmitter to each receiver, at its Nyquist rate, which can be prohibitively
large when high resolution is needed. Overcoming the rate bottleneck,
sub-Nyquist sampling methods have been proposed that break the link between
radar signal bandwidth and sampling rate. In this work, we extend these methods
to MIMO configurations and propose a sub-Nyquist MIMO radar (SUMMeR) system
that performs both time and spatial compression. We present a
range-azimuth-Doppler recovery algorithm from sub-Nyquist samples obtained from
a reduced number of transmitters and receivers, that exploits the sparsity of
the recovered targets' parameters. This allows us to achieve reduction in the
number of deployed antennas and the number of samples per receiver, without
degrading the time and spatial resolutions. Simulations illustrate the
detection performance of SUMMeR for different compression levels and shows that
both time and spatial resolution are preserved, with respect to classic Nyquist
MIMO configurations. We also examine the impact of design parameters, such as
antennas' locations and carrier frequencies, on the detection performance, and

monitoring and analysis. The performance of the surveillance system will
deteriorate when shadows are detected as moving objects. Therefore, shadow
detection and elimination usually benefits the next stages. To overcome this
issue, a method for detection and elimination of shadows is proposed. This
paper presents a method for segmenting moving objects in video sequences based
on determining the Euclidian distance between two pixels considering
neighborhood values in temporal domain. Further, a method that segments cast
and self shadows in video sequences by computing the Eigen values for the
neighborhood of each pixel is proposed. The dual-map for cast and self shadow
pixels is represented based on the interval of Eigen values. The proposed
methods are tested on the benchmark IEEE CHANGE DETECTION 2014 dataset.

f(R) theory to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon coupled equations. In this form, it is
straightforward to modify our existing numerical relativistic codes to simulate
binary black hole mergers in f(R) theory. We considered binary black holes
surrounded by a shell of scalar field. We solve the initial data numerically
using the Olliptic code. The evolution part is calculated using the extended
AMSSNCKU code. Both codes were updated and tested to solve the problem of
binary black holes in f(R) theory. Our results show that the binary black hole
dynamics in f(R) theory is more complex than in general relativity. In
particular, the trajectory and merger time are strongly affected. Via the
gravitational wave, it is possible to constrain the quadratic part parameter of
f(R) theory in the range |a_2|<10^{11} m^2 . In principle, a gravitational wave
detector can distinguish between a merger of binary black hole in f(R) theory

use gravitational wave detection to distinguish between f(R) theory and a non

invariants which change their value across a topological quantum phase
transition. It is commonly assumed that the transition between topologically
distinct noninteracting gapped phases of fermions is necessarily accompanied by
the closing of the band gap as long as the symmetries of the system are

closing the gap in the case of a three-dimensional topological band insulator.
We demonstrate this by calculating the free energy of the minimal model for a
topological insulator, the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, and show that as the
band curvature continuously varies, a jump between the band gap minima
corresponding to the topologically trivial and nontrivial insulators occurs.
Therefore, this first order phase transition is a generic feature of
three-dimensional topological band insulators. For a certain parameter range we
predict a re-entrant topological phase transition. We discuss our findings in
connection with the recent experimental observation of a discontinuous

  semi-norm of the trajectory difference",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper defines constrained functional similarity between 2-D trajectories
via minimizing the H1 semi-norm of the difference between the trajectories. An
exact general solution is obtained for the case wherein the components of the
trajectories are mesh-functions defined on a uniform mesh and the imposed
constraints are linear. Various examples are presented, one of which features
application to mechanics and two-point boundary value problems. A MATLAB code
is given for the solution of one of the examples. The code could easily be
adjusted to other cases.

  displays","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an empirical model for noises in color measurements from OLED
displays. According to measured data the noise is not isotropic in the XYZ
space, instead most of the noise is along an axis that is parallel to a vector
from origin to measured XYZ vector. The presented empirical model is simple and
depends only on the measured XYZ values. Our tests show that the variations
between multiple panels of the same type have similar distribution as the
temporal noise in measurements from a single panel, but a larger magnitude.

  conservation","8 pages,1 figures",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When two objects have gravitational interaction between them, they are no
longer independent of each other. In fact, there exists gravitational
correlation between these two objects. Inspired by E. Verlinde's paper, we
first calculate the entropy change of a system when gravity does positive work
on this system. Based on the concept of gravitational correlation entropy, we
prove that the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole originates from the
gravitational correlations between the interior matters of the black hole. By
analyzing the gravitational correlation entropies in the process of Hawking
radiation in a general context, we prove that the reduced entropy of a black
hole is exactly carried away by the radiation and the gravitational
correlations between these radiating particles, and the entropy or information
is conserved at all times during Hawking radiation. Finally, we attempt to give
a unified description of the non-extensive black-hole entropy and the extensive
entropy of ordinary matter.

characterization of the nonstationary variability of the hydrological regime of
the Kasai River using the wavelet analysis for 1940-1999. The rainfalls and
discharge over Kasai Basin have marked fluctuations with a perceptible downward
trend and some shift around 1950, 1960, 1970, 1983 and 1994. The results show
that rainfalls over Kasai basin and the discharge at Ilebo station patterns
exhibit a strong annual oscillation and some intermittent oscillations in 2-8
years (1950-1975, 1983-1995) and 8-16 years (1970-1999) time scales. The
wavelet coherence analysis reveals a weak possible connection between
hydrological variables (rainfalls, discharge) and climate indices relative to
sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation over Atlantic tropical,
Indian and Pacific Oceans (coherence less than 0.55).
