Lang's conjecture for rational points on varieties of general type over number

our conjecture follows from Vojta's conjecture. Assuming our conjecture, we
prove the following theorem: Fix a number field K, a finite set S of places of
K containing the infinite places, and a positive integer g. Then there is an
integer m_0 such that, for any m > m_0, no principally polarized abelian

latency inadequate for many important interactions. To accommodate the
different latency requirements and visual constraints by different
interactions, we present POLYPATH, a system design in which application
developers (and users) can choose from multiple path designs for their
application at any time. Because a POLYPATH system asks for two or more path

latency by judiciously allowing frame drops and tearing.
  We report an Android 5-based prototype of POLYPATH with two path designs:
Android legacy and Presto. Using this prototype, we quantify the effectiveness,

objective measurements and subjective user assessment. We show that Presto
reduces the latency of legacy touchscreen drawing applications by almost half;

approaches and is achieved without any user-noticeable negative visual effect.
When combined with touch prediction, Presto is able to reduce the touch latency
below 10 ms, a remarkable achievement without any hardware support.

of Agriculture's National Resources Conservation Service between 2010-2012 in
order to provide contemporaneous measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC)
across the US. Despite the broad extent of the RaCA data collection effort,
direct observations of SOC are not available at the high spatial resolution
needed for studying carbon storage in soil and its implications for important
problems in climate science and agriculture. As a result, there is a need for
predicting SOC at spatial locations not included as part of the RaCA project.
In this paper, we compare spatial prediction of SOC using a subset of the RaCA
data for a variety of statistical methods. We investigate the performance of
methods with off-the-shelf software available (both stationary and
nonstationary) as well as a novel nonstationary approach based on partitioning
relevant spatially-varying covariate processes. Our new method addresses open
questions regarding (1) how to partition the spatial domain for
segmentation-based nonstationary methods, (2) incorporating partially observed
covariates into a spatial model, and (3) accounting for uncertainty in the
partitioning. In applying the various statistical methods we find that there
are minimal differences in out-of-sample criteria for this particular data set,
however, there are major differences in maps of uncertainty in SOC predictions.
We argue that the spatially-varying measures of prediction uncertainty produced
by our new approach are valuable to decision makers, as they can be used to
better benchmark mechanistic models, identify target areas for soil restoration
projects, and inform carbon sequestration projects.

more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity

non-ratio ones is that the variance of the observations neither has to be known

outperforms the non-ratio one by keeping the significance level under the null,
mainly when stronger dependence within the panel is taken into account.
However, the non-ratio statistic rejects the null in the simulations more often
than it should, which yields higher power compared to the ratio statistic.

memory bus, thus query execution is heavily optimized to keep tuples in the CPU
caches and registers. To that end, adding additional materialization operations
into a query plan not only add additional traffic to the memory bus but more
importantly prevent the important cache- and register-locality opportunities
resulting in high performance penalties.
  In this paper we study a novel reuse model for intermediates, which caches
internal physical data structures materialized during query processing (due to
pipeline breakers) and externalizes them so that they become reusable for
upcoming operations. We focus on hash tables, the most commonly used internal
data structure in main memory databases to perform join and aggregation
operations. As queries arrive, our reuse-aware optimizer reasons about the
reuse opportunities for hash tables, employing cost models that take into
account hash table statistics together with the CPU and data movement costs
within the cache hierarchy. Experimental results, based on our HashStash
prototype demonstrate performance gains of $2\times$ for typical analytical
workloads with no additional overhead for materializing intermediates.

selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV testing messaging in a
population of homeless youth. Methods. We recruited and assessed 62 youth at
baseline, 1 month (n = 48), and 3 months (n = 38). A Facebook app collected
preliminary social network data. Eleven PCAs selected by AI attended a 1-day
training and 7 weekly booster sessions. Mixed-effects models with random
effects were used to assess change over time. Results. Significant change over
time was observed in past 6-month HIV testing (57.9%, 82.4%, 76.3%; p < .05)
but not condom use (63.9%, 65.7%, 65.8%). Most youth reported speaking to a PCA
about HIV prevention (72.0% at 1 month, 61.5% at 3 months). Conclusions. AI is
a promising avenue for implementing PCA models for homeless youth. Increasing
rates of regular HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention and linking homeless
youth to treatment.

quantify the statistical properties of tidal disruptions by circular SMBH

disruption by a single SMBH, the binary potential induces significant variance

detailed evolution of the fallback debris from 120 disruptions randomly
selected from the three-body ensemble (excluding only the most deeply
penetrating encounters). We find that the overall morphology of the debris is
greatly altered by the presence of the second black hole, and the accretion
rate histories display a wide range of behaviors, including order of magnitude
dips and excesses relative to control simulations that include only one black
hole. Complex evolution persists, in some cases, for many orbital periods of

are studied near spatial infinity. The aim of this analysis is to clarify the
correspondence between data for these fields on a spacelike hypersurface and
the value of their corresponding NP constants at future and past null infinity.
To do so, Friedrich's framework of the cylinder at spatial infinity is employed
to show that, expanding the initial data in terms spherical harmonics and
powers of the geodesic spatial distance $\rho$ to spatial infinity, the NP
constants correspond to the data for the second highest possible spherical
harmonic at fixed order in $\rho$. In addition, it is shown that for generic
initial data within the class considered in this article, there is no natural
correspondence between the NP constants at future and past null infinity ---for
both the Maxwell and spin-2 field. However, if the initial data is
time-symmetric then the NP constants at future and past null infinity have the
same information.

of forces and modification of mechanical properties via light. For example,
similar to neutral atoms and trapped ions, laser cooling of mechanical motion
by radiation pressure can take single mechanical modes to their ground state.
Conventional optomechanical cooling is able to introduce additional damping
channel to mechanical motion, while keeping its thermal noise at the same
level, and as a consequence, the effective temperature of the mechanical mode
is lowered. However, the ratio of temperature to quality factor remains roughly
constant, preventing dramatic advances in quantum sensing using this approach.
Here we propose an approach for simultaneously reducing the thermal load on a
mechanical resonator while improving its quality factor. In essence, we use the
optical interaction to dynamically modify the dominant damping mechanism,
providing an optomechanically-induced effect analogous to a phononic band gap.
The mechanical mode of interest is assumed to be weakly coupled to its heat
bath but strongly coupled to a second mechanical mode, which is cooled by
radiation pressure coupling to a red detuned cavity field. We also identify a
realistic optomechanical design that has the potential to realize this novel
cooling scheme.

three-mode spatial interferometers that, upon inputting, say, a red photon in

detected at one output, the two photons in the other two outputs will pass a
HOM test, despite their frequency degree of freedom remaining untouched. In
doing so we develop a general approach to distinguishability based on the
Schmidt decomposition between particles' ""System"" and ""Label"" degrees of

many-body physics. This also gives insight into the relationship between the
first and second quantized pictures, which is useful in bringing other quantum

is that of superconductors, where coupling to lattice vibrations make electrons
attract each other and leads to the formation of bound pairs. But what if all
degrees of freedom are electronic? Is it still possible to make electrons
attractive via their repulsion from other electrons? Such a mechanism, termed
'excitonic', was proposed fifty years ago by W. A. Little, aiming to achieve
stronger and more exotic superconductivity, yet despite many experimental
efforts, direct evidence for such 'excitonic' attraction is still lacking.
Here, we demonstrate this unique attraction by constructing, from the bottom
up, the fundamental building block of this mechanism. Our experiments are based
on quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic
precision manipulation. Using this platform we demonstrate that two electrons
can be made to attract using an independent electronic system as the binding
glue. Owing to its large tunability, our system offers crucial insights into
the underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent attraction on
the underlying repulsion and the origin of the pairing energy. We also
demonstrate transport signatures of 'excitonic' pairing. This experimental
demonstration of 'excitonic' pairing paves the way for the design of exotic
states of matter.

scales of a few years and to search for variability of our previously detected
excesses.
  Methods: Using VLTI/PIONIER in H band we have carried out multi-epoch
observations of the stars for which a near-infrared excess was previously
detected with the same observing technique and instrument. The detection rates
and distribution of the excesses from our original survey and the follow-up
observations are compared statistically. A search for variability of the
excesses in our time series is carried out based on the level of the broadband
excesses.
  Results: In 12 of 16 follow-up observations, an excess is re-detected with a
significance of > 2 sigma, and in 7 of 16 follow-up observations significant
excess (> 3 sigma) has been re-detected. We statistically demonstrate with very
high confidence that the phenomenon persists for the majority of the systems.
We also present the first detection of potential variability in two sources.
  Conclusions: We conclude that the phenomenon responsible for the excesses
persists over time scales of a few years for the majority of the systems.
However, we also find that variability intrinsic to a target can cause it to
have no significant excess at the time of a specific observation.

orthogonal group $SO(n)$. Our focus is on interpolation schemes obtained by
embedding $SO(n)$ in a linear space, interpolating in the linear space, and
mapping the result onto $SO(n)$ via the closest point projection. The resulting
interpolants inherit both the order of accuracy and the regularity of the
underlying interpolants on the linear space. The values and derivatives of the
interpolants admit efficient evaluation via either explicit formulas or
iterative algorithms, which we detail for two choices of embeddings: the
embedding of $SO(n)$ in the space of $n \times n$ matrices and, when $n=3$, the
identification of $SO(3)$ with the set of unit quaternions. Along the way, we
point out a connection between these interpolation schemes and geodesic finite
elements. We illustrate the utility of these interpolation schemes by
numerically computing minimum acceleration curves on $SO(n)$, a task which is
handled naturally with $SO(n)$-valued finite elements having $C^1$-continuity.

modeling of these harmonics with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes is extremely
challenging as it implies an accurate description of tens of harmonic orders on
a a broad range of angles. In particular, we show here that standard Finite
Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Maxwell solvers used in most PIC codes partly
fail to model Doppler harmonic generation because they induce numerical
dispersion of electromagnetic waves in vacuum which is responsible for a
spurious angular deviation of harmonic beams. This effect was extensively
studied and a simple toy-model based on Snell-Descartes law was developed that
allows us to finely predict the angular deviation of harmonics depending on the
spatio-temporal resolution and the Maxwell solver used in the simulations. Our
model demonstrates that the mitigation of this numerical artifact with FDTD
solvers mandates very high spatio-temporal resolution preventing doing
realistic 3D simulations. We finally show that non dispersive pseudo-spectral
analytical time domain solvers can considerably reduce the spatio-temporal
resolution required to mitigate this spurious deviation and should enable in
the the near future 3D accurate modeling on supercomputers in a realistic
time-to-solution.

$a_i+b_j+c_k=0$ if and only if $i=j=k$.
  Building on this work, Kleinberg, Sawin and Speyer gave a description of a
value $\mu_p$ such that no tri-coloured sum-free sets of size $e^{\mu_p n}$
exist in $\mathbb{Z}_p^{n}$, but for any $\epsilon>0$, such sets of size
$e^{(\mu_p-\epsilon) n}$ exist for all sufficiently large $n$. The value of
$\mu_p$ was left open, but a conjecture was stated which would imply that
$e^{\mu_p}=\lambda_p$, i.e. the Ellenberg-Gijswijt bound is correct for the
sum-free set problem.
  The purpose of this note is to close that gap. The conjecture of Kleinberg,

suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find

extends the formalism to the entire energy regime. Explicit solutions are
obtained for the total angular momentum $J=0$ and $1$ channels. The behavior of
the partial cross sections in the negative energy regime is analyzed in detail.
We find that the leading contributions to the partial cross sections at the
negative energy thresholds are governed by the spin-orbit coupling strength
$k_{\text{so}}$ and the mass ratio. The fact that these contributions are
independent of the two-body scattering length $a_s$ is a direct consequence of
the effective reduction of the dimensionality, and hence of the density of
states, near the scattering thresholds due to the single-particle spin-orbit
coupling terms. The results are analytically continued to the energy regime
where bound states exist. It is shown that our results are consistent with
results obtained by alternative approaches. Our formulation, which can be
regarded as an extension of the standard textbook partial wave decomposition,

spectral densities, popular in physics, which are probability density
distributions that measure the likelihood of finding eigenvalues of the matrix
at a given point on the real line. Integrating the spectral density over an
interval gives the eigenvalue count of the matrix in that interval. Therefore
the rank can be approximated by integrating the spectral density over a
carefully selected interval. Two different approaches are discussed to estimate
the approximate rank, one based on Chebyshev polynomials and the other based on
the Lanczos algorithm. In order to obtain the appropriate interval, it is
necessary to locate a gap between the eigenvalues that correspond to noise and
the relevant eigenvalues that contribute to the matrix rank. A method for
locating this gap and selecting the interval of integration is proposed based
on the plot of the spectral density. Numerical experiments illustrate the
performance of these techniques on matrices from typical applications.

correspond to transitions between thermally occupied excited states of

highly distorted nature of the oxygen octahedron surrounding the iron atoms.
Above $T_N$, magnetic fluctuations are observed up to at least 720~K, with
additional excitation around 4 meV, likely caused by single-ion splittings
through spin-orbit and crystal field interactions. The latter weakens slightly

radio access network (C-RAN) model, where multi-antenna base-stations (BSs) are
connected to a cloud-computing based central processor (CP) via
capacity-limited fronthaul links. The BSs compress the received signals with
Wyner-Ziv coding and send the representation bits to the CP; the CP performs
the decoding of all the users' messages. Under this setup, this paper makes
progress toward the optimal structure of the fronthaul compression and CP
decoding strategies for the compress-and-forward scheme in C-RAN. On the CP
decoding strategy design, this paper shows that under a sum fronthaul capacity
constraint, a generalized successive decoding strategy of the quantization and
user message codewords that allows arbitrary interleaved order at the CP
achieves the same rate region as the optimal joint decoding. Further, it is
shown that a practical strategy of successively decoding the quantization
codewords first, then the user messages, achieves the same maximum sum rate as
joint decoding under individual fronthaul constraints. On the joint
optimization of user transmission and BS quantization strategies, this paper
shows that if the input distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then under
joint decoding, the optimal quantization scheme for maximizing the achievable
rate region is Gaussian. Moreover, Gaussian input and Gaussian quantization
with joint decoding achieve to within a constant gap of the capacity region of
the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink C-RAN model. Finally,
this paper addresses the computational aspect of optimizing uplink MIMO C-RAN
by showing that under fixed Gaussian input, the sum rate maximization problem
over the Gaussian quantization noise covariance matrices can be formulated as
convex optimization problems, thereby facilitating its efficient solution.

feature in many neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury. Among
other things, the FAS have a significant impact on spike-train encodings that
propagate through the affected neurons, leading to compromised signal
processing on a neuronal network level. This work merges, for the first time,
three fields of study: (i) signal processing in excitatory-inhibitory (EI)
networks of neurons via population codes, (ii) decision-making theory driven by
the production of evidence from stimulus, and (iii) compromised spike-train
propagation through FAS. As such, we demonstrate a mathematical architecture
capable of characterizing compromised decision-making driven by cellular
mechanisms. The computational model also leads to several novel predictions and
diagnostics for understanding injury level and cognitive deficits, including a
key finding that decision-making reaction times, rather than accuracy, are
indicative of network level damage. The results have a number of translational
implications, including that the level of network damage can be characterized
by the reaction times in simple cognitive and motor tests.

for both downlink and uplink NOMA, we theoretically derive the NOMA dominant

condition refers to the condition under which the spectral efficiency gains of
NOMA are guaranteed compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA).
The derived conditions provide direct insights on selecting appropriate users
in two-user NOMA clusters. The conditions are distinct for uplink and downlink

the derived conditions for the user selection in uplink/downlink NOMA clusters

the project. The first phase consisted in the development of a mathematical
model that describes the dynamics of the quadcopter. Secondly, a simulation
environment was created to design two different control architectures: cascaded
PID position tracker and LQT trajectory tracker. Finally, the implementation
phase consisted in testing the controllers on the chosen platform and comparing
their performance in trajectory tracking.
  Our simulations agreed with the experimental results, and further refinement
of the model is proposed as future work through closed-loop model
identification techniques. The results show that the LQT controller performed
better at tracking trajectories, with RMS errors in position up to four times
smaller than those obtained with the PID. LQT control effort was greater, but
eliminated the high control peaks that induced motor saturation in the PID
controller. The LQT controller was also tested using an ultra-wide band two-way

that the controller could track a trajectory in both cases despise the

the SIMD model on the Phi. The runtimes for both ODE solvers decreased 2.5-2.7x

Though known for some series of solvable groups, the conjecture has been proved
only for thirteen non-abelian simple groups. We prove the Zassenhaus Conjecture

properties of $\mathrm{BaSn_2}$ by the first-principles combined with Boltzmann
transport theory. The electronic part is carried out by a modified Becke and
Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC), while
the phonon part is performed using generalized gradient approximation (GGA). It
is found that the electronic transport coefficients between the in-plane and
cross-plane directions show the strong anisotropy, while lattice lattice
thermal conductivities show an almost isotropy. Calculated results show a very
low lattice thermal conductivity for $\mathrm{BaSn_2}$, and the corresponding
average lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is 1.69 $\mathrm{W
m^{-1} K^{-1}}$, which is comparable or lower than those of lead chalcogenides
and bismuth-tellurium systems as classic thermoelectric materials. Due to the
complicated scattering mechanism, calculating scattering time $\tau$ is
challenging. By using a empirical $\tau$=$10^{-14}$ s, the n-type figure of

is possible to attain better thermoelectric performance, or to enhance one by

where the polymeric chains unfold easily and the Mooney plot is almost linear.
Second, the strain-hardening regime, where blobs of bundled chains unfold to
stiffen the response in correspondence to the ""upturn"" of the Mooney plot.
Third, the limiting-chain regime, with a sharp stiffening occurring as the
chains extend towards their limit. We provide strain-energy functions with
terms accounting for each stage, that (i) give an accurate local and then
global fitting of the data; (ii) are consistent with weak non-linear elasticity
theory; and (iii) can be interpreted in the framework of statistical mechanics.
We apply our method to Treloar's classical experimental data and also to some
more recent data. Our method not only provides models that describe the
experimental data with a very low quantitative relative error, but also shows
that the theory of non-linear elasticity is much more robust that seemed at

measure space involves a geometrical scalar $f$, dubbed as density function,
which here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. In this framework, we
present conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities and
geodesic equations. In metric measure space, the volume element and accordingly
the operators with integral based definitions are modified. For instance, the
divergence operator in this space differs from the Riemannian one. As a result,
a gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized second
Bianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. It
is shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation of
energy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesic
equation. By comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space with
the Bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, a
relation between density function $f$ and the quantum potential is proposed.
This suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework for
geometric description of Bohm's quantum mechanics. On the other hand, as it is
known, Weyl geometry is one of the main approaches to construct conformally
invariant gravitational models. Regarding the fact that the connection in the
integrable Weyl space is modified and in metric measure space remains the same
as it is in the Riemann space, the mathematical analogy between these two
spaces is also discussed.

$\Gamma/U$ of level width $\Gamma$ to charging energy $U$ is quite large
($\lesssim 0.5$ rather than $\ll 1$). This situation is commonly used in GaAs
quantum dots to ensure Kondo temperatures large enough ($\simeq 100$ mK here)
to be experimentally accessible; however it also implies that charge
fluctuations are more pronounced than typically assumed in theoretical studies
focusing on the regime $\Gamma/U \ll 1$ needed to ensure a well-defined local
moment. Our measured phase evolves monotonically by $\pi$ across the two
Coulomb peaks, but without being locked at $\pi/2$ in the Kondo valley for $T
\ll T_{\rm K}$, due to a significant influence of large $\Gamma/U$. Only when
$\Gamma/U$ is reduced sufficiently does the phase start to be locked around
$\pi/2$ and develops into a plateau at $\pi/2$. Our observations are consistent

they are found on riverbeds and in oil pipelines that transport sand. In both
natural and industrial cases, ripples increase friction between the bed and
fluid and are related to flooding, high pressure drops, and transients. Ripples
appear when sediments are entrained as bed load (a mobile granular layer) and
are usually considered to be the result of initial bedforms that eventually
saturate. Given the small aspect ratio of the initial bedforms, linear analyses
can be used to understand the formation of ripples. This paper presents a
linear stability analysis of a granular bed under a turbulent flow of a liquid.
This analysis takes into consideration all the main mechanisms and parameters
involved in the turbulent liquid case, including some important parameters that
have not yet been considered together such as the bed compactness and the
bed-load threshold shear stress. The results of this analysis are compared with
published experimental results and they show good agreement.

stress tensor for initially stressed elastic solids. The restriction applies to
strain energy functions $W$ that are explicit functions of the elastic
deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$ and initial stress $\boldsymbol \tau$, i.e.
$W:= W(\mathbf F, \boldsymbol \tau)$. The restriction is a consequence of
energy conservation and ensures that the predicted stress and strain energy do
not depend upon an arbitrary choice of reference configuration. We call this
restriction: initial stress reference independence (ISRI). It transpires that
almost all strain energy functions found in the literature do not satisfy ISRI,
and may therefore lead to unphysical behaviour, which we illustrate via a
simple example. To remedy this shortcoming we derive three strain energy
functions that do satisfy the restriction. We also show that using initial
strain (often from a virtual configuration) to model initial stress leads to
strain energy functions that automatically satisfy ISRI. Finally, we reach the
following important result: ISRI reduces the number of unknowns of the linear
stress tensor of initially stressed solids. This new way of reducing the linear
stress may open new pathways for the non-destructive determination of initial
stresses via ultrasonic experiments, among others.

complexity of the proposed probabilistic RVO is comparable to the deterministic

substitute the computationally intractable chance constraints with a family of

to efficiently characterize their solution space. Further, we also show that
the solution space of each member of the family of surrogate constraints can be
mapped in closed form to the probability with which the original chance
constraints are satisfied and thus consequently to probability of collision
avoidance. We validate our formulations through numerical simulations where we
highlight the importance of incorporating the effect of motion uncertainty and
the advantages of PRVO over existing formulations which handles the effect of
uncertainty by using conservative bounding volumes.

$d-$wave symmetry for the superconducting state in some Fe-based materials. It
is a common belief that a $d-$wave gap in the Fe-based superconductors must
have nodes on the Fermi surfaces centered at the $\Gamma$ point of the
Brillouin zone. Here we show that, while this is the case for a single Fermi
surface made out of a single orbital, the situation is more complex if there is
an even number of Fermi surfaces made out of different orbitals. In particular,
we show that for the two $\Gamma$-centered hole Fermi surfaces made out of
$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, the nodal points still exist near $T_{c}$ along
the symmetry-imposed directions, but are are displaced to momenta between the
two Fermi surfaces. If the two hole pockets are close enough, pairs of nodal
points can merge and annihilate at some $T<T_{c}$, making the $d-$wave state
completely nodeless. These results imply that photoemission evidence for a
nodeless gap on the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Fermi surfaces of KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ does
not rule out $d-$wave gap symmetry in this material, while a nodeless gap
observed on the $d_{xy}$ pocket in K$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ is truly
inconsistent with the $d-$wave gap symmetry.

results showed that the $e$-$e$ interaction with $RSOC$ opens a spin energy gap

junction produces a large spin-polarized current and could act as a
high-efficiency spin filter device (nearly 100\% spin polarization) at room

transmission is influenced and can be predicted by local climaticand

newborn babies in nine villages in the ToriBossito district of Southern Benin
between June 2007 and February 2010, human landing catches were performed to
assessthe density of malaria vectors and transmission intensity. Climatic
factors as well as household characteristics were recordedthroughout the study.
Statistical correlations between Anopheles density and environmental and
climatic factors weretested using a three-level Poisson mixed regression model.
The results showed both temporal variations in vector density(related to season
and rainfall), and spatial variations at the level of both village and house.
These spatial variations could belargely explained by factors associated with
the house's immediate surroundings, namely soil type, vegetation index andthe
proximity of a watercourse. Based on these results, a predictive regression
model was developed using a leave-one-outmethod, to predict the spatiotemporal
variability of malaria transmission in the nine villages. This study points up
theimportance of local environmental factors in malaria transmission and
describes a model to predict the transmission risk ofindividual children, based
on environmental and behavioral characteristics.
