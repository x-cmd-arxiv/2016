  Crowd Understanding, 2016",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite of the recent success of neural networks for human pose estimation,
current approaches are limited to pose estimation of a single person and cannot
handle humans in groups or crowds. In this work, we propose a method that
estimates the poses of multiple persons in an image in which a person can be
occluded by another person or might be truncated. To this end, we consider
multi-person pose estimation as a joint-to-person association problem. We
construct a fully connected graph from a set of detected joint candidates in an
image and resolve the joint-to-person association and outlier detection using
integer linear programming. Since solving joint-to-person association jointly
for all persons in an image is an NP-hard problem and even approximations are
expensive, we solve the problem locally for each person. On the challenging
MPII Human Pose Dataset for multiple persons, our approach achieves the
accuracy of a state-of-the-art method, but it is 6,000 to 19,000 times faster.

when the performance of the online algorithm with $k$ servers is compared to
the offline optimal solution with $h \leq k$ servers. The problem is very
poorly understood beyond uniform metrics. For this special case, the classic
$k$-server algorithms are roughly $(1+1/\epsilon)$-competitive when
$k=(1+\epsilon) h$, for any $\epsilon >0$. Surprisingly however, no
$o(h)$-competitive algorithm is known even for HSTs of depth 2 and even when
$k/h$ is arbitrarily large.
  We obtain several new results for the problem. First we show that the known
$k$-server algorithms do not work even on very simple metrics. In particular,
the Double Coverage algorithm has competitive ratio $\Omega(h)$ irrespective of
the value of $k$, even for depth-2 HSTs. Similarly the Work Function Algorithm,
that is believed to be optimal for all metric spaces when $k=h$, has
competitive ratio $\Omega(h)$ on depth-3 HSTs even if $k=2h$. Our main result
is a new algorithm that is $O(1)$-competitive for constant depth trees,
whenever $k =(1+\epsilon )h$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Finally, we give a general
lower bound that any deterministic online algorithm has competitive ratio at
least 2.4 even for depth-2 HSTs and when $k/h$ is arbitrarily large. This gives
a surprising qualitative separation between uniform metrics and depth-2 HSTs
for the $(h,k)$-server problem, and gives the strongest known lower bound for
the problem on general metrics.

After initialization with an autoregessive fit of the noise, a few iterations

developed in the framework of the MICROSCOPE space mission whose goal is to

show by numerical simulations that the developed method allows us to meet three

of the loss of data, to calculate a reliable estimate of this precision and of
the noise level, and finally to provide consistent and faithful reconstructed

radiation of massive stars, or supernova explosions. Star formation and young
stellar objects are commonly associated with these structures. We compare IR
observations of bubbles N115, N116 and N117 with atomic, molecular and ionized
gas in this region. While determining the dynamical properties of the bubbles,
we also look into their ambient environment to understand their formation in a
wider context. For finding bubbles in HI (VLA Galactic Plane Survey) and CO
data (Galactic Ring Survey), we used their images from Galactic Legacy Infrared
Mid-Plane Survey. We manually constructed masks based on the appearance of the
bubbles in the IR images and applied it to the HI and CO data. We determined
their kinematic distance, size, expansion velocity, mass, original density of
the maternal cloud, age and energy input. We identified two systems of bubbles:
the first, background system, is formed by large structures G053.9+0.2 and SNR
G054.4-0.3 and the infrared bubble N116+117. The second, foreground system,
includes the infrared bubble N115 and two large HI bubbles, which we discovered
in the HI data. Both systems are independent, lying at different distances, but
look similar. They are both formed by two large colliding bubbles with radii
around 20-30 pc and ages of a few million years. A younger and smaller (~4 pc,
less than a million years) infrared bubble lies at the position of the
collision. We found that both infrared bubbles N115 and N116+117 are associated
with the collisions of larger and older bubbles. We propose, that such
collisions increase the probability of further star formation, probably by
squeezing the interstellar material, suggesting that it is an important
mechanism for star formation.

appropriate for diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for quality assurance,
protocol optimization and sequence development.
  Methods: A range of agar, agarose and polyvinyl alcohol phantoms with
concentrations ranging from 1.0% to 3.5%, 0.5% to 3.0% and 10% to 20%,
respectively, and up to 3 g of glass microspheres per 100 ml were created.
Diffusion coefficients, excess kurtosis values and relaxation rates were
experimentally determined.
  Results: The kurtosis values for the plain gels ranged from 0.05 with 95%
confidence interval (CI) of $(0.029, 0.071)$ to $0.216(0.185, 0.246)$, well
below the kurtosis values reported in the literature for various tissues. The
addition of glass microspheres increased the kurtosis of the gels with values
up to $0.523(0.465, 0.581)$ observed for gels with the highest concentration of
microspheres. Repeat scans of some of the gels after more than six months of
storage at room temperature indicate changes in the diffusion parameters of
less than 10%. The addition of the glass microspheres reduces the apparent
diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and increases the longitudinal and transverse
relaxation rates but the values remain comparable to those for plain gels and
tissue, with ADCs observed ranging from $818(585, 1053) \times 10^{-6}$
mm$^2$/s to $2257(2118, 2296) \times 10^{-6}$ mm$^2$/s, and R1 values ranging
from $0.34(0.32, 0.35)$ 1/s to $0.51(0.50, 0.52)$ 1/s, and R2 values ranging
from $9.69(9.34, 10.04)$ 1/s to $33.07(27.10, 39.04)$ 1/s.
  Conclusions: Glass microspheres can be used to effectively modify diffusion
properties of gel phantoms and achieve a range of kurtosis values comparable to
those reported for a variety of tissues.

different epochs and latitudes show evidence of short and medium timescale
variability as well as latitudinal differences. Spatial and temporal
variability is also predicted in mesospheric and thermosphere terminator models
with lower boundary conditions at 70 km near cloud tops. The Venus transit on
June 5-6 2012 was the first to occur with a spacecraft in orbit around Venus.
It has been shown that sunlight refraction in the mesosphere of Venus is able
to provide useful constraints on mesospheric temperatures at the time of the
transit. The European Space Agency's Venus Express provided space-based
observations of Venus during the transit. Simultaneously, the Venus aureole
photometry was observed using ground-based facilities and solar telescopes
orbiting Earth (NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory, JAXA HINODE). As the properties
of spatial and temporal variability of the mesosphere are still debated, the
opportunity of observing it at all latitudes at the same time, offered by the
transit, is rather unique. In this first paper, we establish new methods for
analyzing the photometry of the so-called aureole that is produced by
refraction of the solar light, and we investigate the choice of physical models
that best reproduce the observations. We obtain an independent constraint of
4.8 +/- 0.5 km for the aerosol scale height in the upper haze region above 80
km. We show that a full multiple-layer approach is required to adequately
reproduce the aureole photometry, which appears to be sensitive to several
second-order variations in the vertical refractivity.

themselves often possess the structure of graded Hopf algebras (with one-sided
unit). We can enumerate faces using the fact that they are structure types of
substitutions of combinatorial species. Species considered here include ordered

suspensions at different Galileo numbers, Ga. The Galileo number is the ratio
between buoyancy and viscous forces, and is here varied via the solid-to-fluid
density ratio. The focus is on particles that are slightly heavier than the
fluid. We find that in HIT, the mean settling speed is less than that in
quiescent fluid; in particular, it reduces by 6%-60% with respect to the
terminal velocity of an isolated sphere in quiescent fluid as the ratio between
the latter and the turbulent velocity fluctuations is decreased. Analysing the
fluid-particle relative motion, we find that the mean settling speed is
progressively reduced while reducing the density ratio due to the increase of
the vertical drag induced by the particle cross-flow velocity. Unsteady effects
contribute to the mean overall drag by about 6%-10%. The probability density

of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) while in situ measurements
provide magnetic field and plasma parameter measurements along the spacecraft
trajectory, so along a 1D cut. As such, the data only give a partial view of
their 3D structures. By studying a large number of ICMEs, crossed at different
distances from their apex, we develop statistical methods to obtain a
quantitative generic 3D shape of ICMEs. In a first approach we theoretically
obtain the expected statistical distribution of the shock-normal orientation
from assuming simple models of 3D shock shapes, including distorted profiles,
and compare their compatibility with observed distributions. In a second
approach we use the shock normal and the flux rope axis orientations, as well
as the impact parameter, to provide statistical information across the
spacecraft trajectory. The study of different 3D shock models shows that the
observations are compatible with a shock symmetric around the Sun-apex line as
well as with an asymmetry up to an aspect ratio around 3. Moreover, flat or
dipped shock surfaces near their apex can only be rare cases. Next, the sheath
thickness and the ICME velocity have no global trend along the ICME front.
Finally, regrouping all these new results and the ones of our previous
articles, we provide a quantitative ICME generic 3D shape, including the global
shape of the shock, the sheath and the flux rope. The obtained quantitative
generic ICME shape will have implications for several aims. For example, it
constrains the output of typical ICME numerical simulations. It is also a base
to develop deeper studies of the transport of high energy solar and cosmic
particles during an ICME propagation, as well as for modeling and forecasting
space weather conditions near Earth.

examine the role of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the production
and acceleration of outflows from discs. Via a suite of one-dimensional
shearing-box simulations of stratified discs we show that magneto-centrifugal
winds exhibit cyclic activity with a period of 10-20 Omega^{-1}, a few times
the orbital period. The cycle seems to be more vigorous for strong vertical
field; it is robust to the variation of relevant parameters and independent of
numerical details. The convergence of these solutions (in particular the mass
loss rate) with vertical box size is also studied. By considering a sequence of
magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their stability, the periodic activity may be
understood as the succession of the following phases: (a) a dominant MRI
channel mode, (b) strong magnetic field generation, (c) consequent wind
launching, and ultimately (d) vertical expulsion of the excess magnetic field
by the expanding and accelerating gas associated with the wind. We discuss
potential connections between this behaviour and observed time-variability in
disk-jet systems.

periodic strain since it can be mapped onto an effective one-dimensional
system. Also, two kinds of time-periodic driving are considered: a short pulse
(delta kicking) and a sinusoidal variation (harmonic driving). We prove that
for special strain wavelengths, the system is described by a two level Dirac
Hamiltonian. Even though the study case is gapless, we find that topologically
non-trivial flat bands emerge not only at zero-quasienergy but also at $\pm\pi$
quasienergy, the latter being a direct consequence of the periodicity of the
Floquet space. Both kind of flat bands are thus understood as dispersionless
bands joining two inequivalent touching band points with opposite Berry phase.
This is confirmed by explicit evaluation of the Berry phase in the touching
band points' neighborhood. Using that information, the topological phase
diagram of the system is built. Additionally, the experimental feasibility of
the model is discussed and two methods for the experimental realization of our

automatic matches without user input, volumetric deformations that can be
applied to details around the surface, and the inherent handling of topology

adsorbed on the amorphous sio2 surface (SLP/a-sio2), and (ii) the further
incorporation of water molecules at the phosphorene/a-sio2 interface. In (i),
we find that the phosphorene sheet bonds to a-sio2 through van der Waals
interactions, even upon the presence of oxygen vacancy on the surface. The
\slp/a-\sio\ system presents a type-I band alignment, with the valence
(conduction) band maximum (minimum) of the phosphorene lying within the energy
gap of the a-\sio\ substrate. The structural, and the surface-potential
corrugations promote the formation of electron-rich and -poor regions on the
phosphorene sheet and at the SLP/a-sio2 interface. Such charge density puddles
have been strengthened by the presence of oxygen vacancies in a-sio2. In (ii),
due to the amorphous structure of the surface, we have considered a number of
plausible geometries of water embedded in the SLP/a-sio2 interface. There is an
energetic preference to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups on the a-sio2
surface. Meanwhile, upon the presence of oxygenated water or interstitial
oxygen in the phosphorene sheet, we find the formation of metastable OH bonded
to the phosphorene, and the formation of energetically stable P--O--Si chemical
bonds at the SLP/a-sio2 interface. Further x-ray absorption spectra (XAS)
simulations have been done, aiming to provide additional structural/electronic
informations of the oxygen atoms forming hydroxyl groups or P--O--Si chemical
bonds at the interface region.

convex-concave function, which we term saddle function. The dynamics consists
of gradient descent of the saddle function in variables corresponding to
convexity and (projected) gradient ascent in variables corresponding to
concavity. We examine the role that the local and/or global nature of the
convexity-concavity properties of the saddle function plays in guaranteeing
convergence and robustness of the dynamics. Under the assumption that the
saddle function is twice continuously differentiable, we provide a novel
characterization of the omega-limit set of the trajectories of this dynamics in
terms of the diagonal blocks of the Hessian. Using this characterization, we
establish global asymptotic convergence of the dynamics under local strong
convexity-concavity of the saddle function. When strong convexity-concavity
holds globally, we establish three results. First, we identify a Lyapunov
function (that decreases strictly along the trajectory) for the projected
saddle-point dynamics when the saddle function corresponds to the Lagrangian of
a general constrained convex optimization problem. Second, for the particular
case when the saddle function is the Lagrangian of an equality-constrained
optimization problem, we show input-to-state stability of the saddle-point
dynamics by providing an ISS Lyapunov function. Third, we use the latter result
to design an opportunistic state-triggered implementation of the dynamics.
Various examples illustrate our results.

effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control
algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving
experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to
achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an
autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where multiple
interactions between vehicles and drivers simultaneously occur. Traffic
simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with
reasonable fidelity can help decrease the time and effort necessary for the
development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue
where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and
safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic
traffic model that can be used to 1) test and compare various autonomous
vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an
existing control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the
first case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control
systems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we
optimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the

tools to understand these differences. This effort is necessary in order to

galactic model with a disk, a spherical nucleus, and a biaxial dark matter halo

dynamical system influence the position and the stability of all resonant
families. To locate the position and measure the stability of periodic orbits
we use a highly sensitive numerical code which is able to identify resonant
periodic orbits of the type $n:m$. Two cases are studied for every parameter:
(i) the case where the dark matter halo component is prolate and (ii) the case
where an oblate dark matter halo is present. Our numerical exploration reveals
that all the dynamical quantities affect, more or less, the position and the
stability of the periodic orbits. It is shown that the mass of the nucleus, the
mass of the disk, the halo flattening parameter, the scale length of the halo,
the angular momentum, and the total orbital energy are the most influential
quantities, while the effect of all other parameters is much weaker.

We show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the star plane induces a

  Multi-Objective Optimization","27 pages, 3 figures, 15 tables",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The balance between convergence and diversity is a key issue of evolutionary
multi-objective optimization. The recently proposed stable matching-based
selection provides a new perspective to handle this balance under the framework
of decomposition multi-objective optimization. In particular, the stable
matching between subproblems and solutions, which achieves an equilibrium
between their mutual preferences, implicitly strikes a balance between the
convergence and diversity. Nevertheless, the original stable matching model has
a high risk of matching a solution with a unfavorable subproblem which finally
leads to an imbalanced selection result. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
two-level stable matching-based selection for decomposition multi-objective
optimization. Specifically, borrowing the idea of stable matching with
incomplete lists, we match each solution with one of its favorite subproblems
by restricting the length of its preference list during the first-level stable
matching. During the second-level stable matching, the remaining subproblems
are thereafter matched with their favorite solutions according to the classic
stable matching model. In particular, we develop an adaptive mechanism to
automatically set the length of preference list for each solution according to
its local competitiveness. The performance of our proposed method is validated
and compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective
optimization algorithms on 62 benchmark problem instances. Empirical results
fully demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed method on
problems with complicated Pareto sets and those with more than three
objectives.

(HBT) like correlations accompanied by a back-to-back maximum, (iii) near-side
correlations, and (iv) away-side azimuthal correlations. The geometric
correlations (i) are due to the fact that nucleons are correlated by simply
being confined within the same nucleus. Correlations (iii) and (iv) have
exactly the same amplitudes along with azimuthal and rapidity shapes: one
centered around $\Delta \phi =0$ and the other one centered around $\Delta \phi
=\pi$ (here $\Delta \phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the two produced
gluons). The geometry dependence of the correlation function leads to stronger
azimuthal near- and away-side correlations in the tip-on-tip U+U collisions

correlations generated by the elliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma: a study
of azimuthal correlations in the U+U collisions may help to disentangle the two
sources of correlations. Finally we rewrite our result for the two-gluon
production cross-section in a $k_T$-factorized form resulting in an expression

one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the group $G$ and (mutually
non-isomorphic) $R_e$-bimodules in $R$, given by $G \supseteq H \mapsto
\oplus_{h\in H} R_h$. For strongly $G$-graded rings, the property of being
$G$-controlled is stronger than that of being simple. We provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for a general $G$-graded ring to be $G$-controlled. We
also give a characterization of strongly $G$-graded rings which are
$G$-controlled. As an application of our main results we give a description of
all intermediate subrings $T$ with $R_e \subseteq T \subseteq R$ of a
$G$-controlled strongly $G$-graded ring $R$. Our results generalize results for
artinian skew group rings which were shown by Azumaya 70 years ago. In the
special case of skew group rings we obtain an algebraic analogue of a recent
result by Cameron and Smith on bimodules in crossed products of von Neumann
algebras.

evolution and nature of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. Although Proxima
Cen b orbits within its star's habitable zone, multiple plausible evolutionary
paths could have generated different environments that may or may not be
habitable. Here we use 1D coupled climate-photochemical models to generate
self-consistent atmospheres for evolutionary scenarios predicted in our
companion paper (Barnes et al., 2016). These include high-O2, high-CO2, and
more Earth-like atmospheres, with either oxidizing or reducing compositions. We
show that these modeled environments can be habitable or uninhabitable at
Proxima Cen b's position in the habitable zone. We use radiative transfer
models to generate synthetic spectra and thermal phase curves for these
simulated environments, and instrument models to explore our ability to
discriminate between possible planetary states. These results are applicable
not only to Proxima Cen b, but to other terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs.
Thermal phase curves may provide the first constraint on the existence of an
atmosphere, and JWST observations longward of 7 microns could characterize
atmospheric heat transport and molecular composition. Detection of ocean glint
is unlikely with JWST, but may be within the reach of larger aperture
telescopes. Direct imaging spectra may detect O4, which is diagnostic of
massive water loss and O2 retention, rather than a photosynthesis. Similarly,
strong CO2 and CO bands at wavelengths shortward of 2.5 {\mu}m would indicate a
CO2-dominated atmosphere. If the planet is habitable and volatile-rich, direct
imaging will be the best means of detecting habitability. Earth-like planets
with microbial biospheres may be identified by the presence of CH4 and either
photosynthetically produced O2 or a hydrocarbon haze layer.

the observed relative abundances from dust depletion. This implies that grain
growth in the ISM is an important process of dust production. These sequences
are continuous in [Zn/Fe] from dust-free to dusty DLAs, and to Galactic clouds,
suggesting that the availability of refractory metals in the ISM is crucial for
dust production, regardless of the star formation history. We observe [S/Zn] up
to ~ 0.25 dex in DLAs, which is broadly consistent with Galactic stellar
abundances. Furthermore, we find a good agreement between the nucleosynthetic
pattern of Galactic halo stars and our observations of the least dusty DLAs.
This supports recent star formation in low-metallicity DLAs. The derived
depletions of Zn, O, P, S, Si, Mg, Mn, Cr, and Fe correlate with [Zn/Fe], with
steeper slopes for more refractory elements. P is mostly not affected by dust

cosmological constraints are determined for low scale quartic hilltop models of
inflation paired with a curvaton field, which imprints the spectrum of scalar
perturbations observed in large scale structure and on the cosmic microwave

at energies GeV--PeV, can be mapped to an MeV--TeV mass inflaton resonance,
discoverable through a Higgs portal coupling at upcoming collider and meson

detectably large couplings to Standard Model particles through a Higgs portal,
permitting prompt reheating after inflation, without spoiling, through
radiative corrections to the inflaton's self-coupling, the necessary flatness
of a low scale inflationary potential. A characteristic particle spectrum for a

confirming that the environment has a strong influence on the integrated colors

capture the differences we observe in color-color space. While the average
photometric colors become bluer with increasing radial distance to the cD

larger dynamic range in certain color indices. We argue that these results are
not due solely to differential extinction, IMF variations, calibration
uncertainties, or overall age/metallicity variations. We therefore suggest that
the relation between the environment and GC colors is, at least in part, due to
chemical abundance variations, which affect stellar spectra and stellar
evolution tracks. Our results demonstrate that stellar population diagnostics
derived from model predictions which are calibrated on one particular sample of
GCs may not be appropriate for all extragalactic GCs. These results advocate a
more complex model of the assembly history of GC systems in massive galaxies

constraining self-interacting dark matter, but few simulations exist to back up
this claim. We simulate equal mass mergers of 10$^{15}$ M$_\odot$ halos, like
the El Gordo and Sausage clusters, with cosmologically-motivated halo and
merger parameters, and with velocity-independent dark-matter self-interactions.
Although the standard lore for merging clusters is that self-interactions lead
to large separations between the galaxy and dark-matter distributions, we find
that maximal galaxy-dark matter offsets of $\lesssim~20$~kpc form for a
self-interaction cross section of $\sigma_\text{SI}/m_\chi$ = 1 cm$^2$/g. This
is an order of magnitude smaller than those measured in observed equal mass and
near equal mass mergers, and is likely to be even smaller for lower-mass
systems. While competitive cross-section constraints are thus unlikely to
emerge from offsets, we find other signatures of self-interactions which are
more promising. Intriguingly, we find that after dark matter halos coalesce,
the collisionless galaxies (and especially the Brightest Cluster Galaxy [BGC])
oscillate around the center of the merger remnant on stable orbits of 100 kpc
for $\sigma_\text{SI}/m_\chi = 1$~cm$^2$/g for at least several Gyr, well after
the clusters have relaxed. If BCG miscentering in relaxed clusters remains a
robust prediction of SIDM under the addition of gas physics, substructure,
merger mass ratios (e.g., 10:1 like the Bullet Cluster), and complex
cosmological merger histories, the observed BCG offsets may constrain
$\sigma_\text{SI}/m_\chi \lesssim$ 0.1 cm$^2$/g---the tightest constraint yet.

this code, we calculate SNe lightcurves using three different techniques common
in the literature: the quasi-bolometric method, which integrates the observed
photometry, the direct integration method, which additionally corrects for
unobserved flux in the UV and IR, and the bolometric correction method, which
uses correlations between observed colors and V-band bolometric corrections. We
present here the lightcurves calculated by SuperBoL along with previously
published lightcurves, as well as peak luminosities and Ni-56 yields. We find
that the direct integration and bolometric correction lightcurves largely agree
with previously published lightcurves, but with what we believe to be more
robust error calculations, with $0.2 \leq \delta L_{bol}/L_{bol} \leq 0.5$.
Peak luminosities and Ni-56 masses are similarly comparable to previous work.
SN 2000cb remains an unusual member of this sub-group, owing to the faster rise
and flatter plateau than the other supernovae in the sample. Initial
comparisons with the NLTE atmosphere code PHOENIX show that the direct
integration technique re-produces the luminosity of a model supernova spectrum
to ~5% when given synthetic photometry of the spectrum as input. Our code is
publicly available. The ability to produce bolometric lightcurves from observed
sets of broad-band light curves should be helpful in the interpretation of
other types of supernovae, particularly those that are not well characterized,
such as extremely luminous supernovae and faint fast objects.

enrichments in heavy elements associated with either the s (slow) or the r
(rapid) neutron-capture process (e.g., barium and europium respectively), and
in some cases they display evidence of both. The abundance patterns of these
CEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu enrichment, are particularly puzzling
since the s and the r processes require neutron densities that are more than
ten orders of magnitude apart, and hence are thought to occur in very different
stellar sites with very different physical conditions. We investigate whether
the abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis of
the intermediate neutron-capture process (the i process), which is
characterised by neutron densities between those of the s and the r processes.
Using nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture nucleosynthesis at
different constant neutron densities n ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$
cm$^{-3}$. With respect to the classical s process resulting from neutron
densities on the lowest side of this range, neutron densities on the highest
side result in abundance patterns that show an increased production of heavy
s-process and r-process elements but similar abundances of the light s-process
elements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars due to proton ingestion episodes. Comparison to the
surface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars show that our modelled i-process
abundances successfully reproduce observed abundance patterns that could not be
previously explained by s-process nucleosynthesis. Because the i-process models
fit the abundances of CEMP-s/r stars so well, we propose that this class should
be renamed as CEMP-i.

neutron star (NS) binary companion provides a natural formation scenario for
the PSR B1257+12 planetary system. Starting with initial conditions for the
debris disk produced of the disrupted WD, we model its long term viscous
evolution, including for the first time the effects of mass and angular
momentum loss during the early radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)
phase and accounting for the unusual C/O composition on the disk opacity. For
plausible values of the disk viscosity $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ and the
RIAF mass loss efficiency, we find that the disk mass remaining near the planet
formation radius at the time of solid condensation is sufficient to explain the
pulsar planets. Rapid rocky planet formation via gravitational instability of
the solid carbon-dominated disk is facilitated by the suppression of vertical
shear instabilities due to the high solid-to-gas ratio. Additional evidence
supporting a WD-NS merger scenario includes (1) the low observed occurrence
rate of pulsar planets ($\lesssim 1\%$ of NS birth), comparable to the expected
WD-NS merger rate; (2) accretion by the NS during the RIAF phase is sufficient
to spin PSR B1257+12 up to its observed 6 ms period; (3) similar models of `low
angular momentum' disks, such as those produced from supernova fallback, find
insufficient mass reaching the planet formation radius. The unusually high
space velocity of PSR B1257+12 of $\gtrsim 326\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ suggests a
possible connection to the Calcium-rich transients, dim supernovae which occur
in the outskirts of their host galaxies and were proposed to result from
mergers of WD-NS binaries receiving SN kicks. The C/O disk composition implied
by our model likely results in carbon-rich planets with diamond interiors.

signatures of the nature of compact objects. It has been recently argued that
the post-merger ringdown waveform of exotic ultracompact objects is initially
identical to that of a black-hole, and that putative corrections at the horizon
scale will appear as secondary pulses after the main burst of radiation. Here
we extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this
result applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere
for generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the
late-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized
by a modulated and distorted train of ""echoes"" of the modes of vibration
associated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time
equal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare
their gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes. If
the initial objects are compact enough as to mimic a binary black-hole
collision up to the merger, the final object exceeds the maximum mass for boson
stars and collapses to a black-hole. This suggests that - in some
configurations - the coalescence of compact boson stars might be almost
indistinguishable from that of black-holes. On the other hand, generic
configurations display peculiar signatures that can be searched for in
gravitational-wave data as smoking guns of exotic compact objects.

characterization of young, self-luminous giant planets at wide orbital
separations from their host stars. Some of these planets show evidence for
disequilibrium processes like transport-induced quenching in their atmospheres;
photochemistry may also be important, despite the large orbital distances.
These disequilibrium chemical processes can alter the expected composition,
spectral behavior, thermal structure, and cooling history of the planets, and
can potentially confuse determinations of bulk elemental ratios, which provide
important insights into planet-formation mechanisms. Using a
thermo/photochemical kinetics and transport model, we investigate the extent to
which disequilibrium chemistry affects the composition and spectra of directly
imaged giant exoplanets. Results for specific ""young Jupiters"" such as HR 8799
b and 51 Eri b are presented, as are general trends as a function of planetary
effective temperature, surface gravity, incident ultraviolet flux, and strength
of deep atmospheric convection. We find that quenching is very important on
young Jupiters, leading to CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 ratios much greater than, and H2O
mixing ratios a factor of a few less than, chemical-equilibrium predictions.
Photochemistry can also be important on such planets, with CO2 and HCN being
key photochemical products. Carbon dioxide becomes a major constituent when
stratospheric temperatures are low and recycling of water via the H2 + OH
reaction becomes kinetically stifled. Young Jupiters with effective
temperatures <~ 700 K are in a particularly interesting photochemical regime
that differs from both transiting hot Jupiters and our own solar-system giant
planets.

modulo another prime number, $ p$, experimentally seems to be slightly more
likely to be a nonquadratic residue than a quadratic residue. We thought it
would be interesting to model this residue bias as a ""random"" walk using
Legendre symbol values as steps. Such a model would allow us to easily
visualize the bias. In addition, we would be able to extend our model to other
number fields.
  In this report, we first outline underlying theory and some motivations for
our research. In the second section, we present our findings in the rational
prime numbers. We found evidence that Chebyshev's bias, if modeled as a
Legendre symbol $ \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)$ walk, may be somewhat reduced by
only allowing $ q$ to iterate over primes with nonquadratic residue (mod $ 4$).
In the final section, we extend our Legendre symbol walks to the Gaussian
primes and present our main findings. Let $ \pi_1 = \alpha+\beta i$ and $ \pi_2
= \beta+\alpha i$. We observed strong ($ \pm$) correlations between Gaussian
Legendre symbol walks for $ \left[\frac{a+bi}{\pi_1}\right]$ and $
\left[\frac{a+bi}{\pi_2}\right]$ where $ N(\pi_1) = N(\pi_2)$ and $ a+bi$
iterates over Gaussian primes in the first quadrant. We attempt an explanation
of why, for some norms, the plots for $ \pi_1$ and $ \pi_2$ have strong
positive correlation, while, for other norms, the plots have strong negative
correlation. We hope to have written in a way that makes our observations
accessible to readers without prior formal training in number theory.

of asymptotically efficient deterministic and randomized sorting operations

  We utilize parallel sorting techniques such as deterministic regular sampling

Eu mass in some UFDs combined with detections of much larger masses in a UFD,
Reticulum II, and other dwarf galaxies imply that Eu production is dominated by
rare events, and that the minimal Eu mass observed in any UFD is approximately
the amount of Eu mass produced per event. This is consistent with other
independent observations in the Galaxy. We estimate, using a model independent
likelihood analysis, the rate and Eu (Fe) mass produced per $r$-process (Fe
production) event in dwarf galaxies including classical dwarfs and UFDs. The
mass and rate of the Fe production events are consistent with the normal
core-collapse supernova~(ccSN) scenario. The Eu mass per event is $3\times
10^{-5}M_{\odot}<\tilde{m}_{\rm Eu}<2\times 10^{-4}M_{\odot}$, corresponding to
a total $r$-process mass per event of $6\times
10^{-3}M_{\odot}<\tilde{m}_{r-process}<4\times 10^{-2}M_{\odot}$. The rate of
$r$-process events is $2.5\times 10^{-4}<R_{rp/SN}<1.4\times 10^{-3}$ as
compared with the ccSNe rate. These values are consistent with the total Eu
mass observed in our own Galaxy, suggesting that the same mechanism is behind
the production of $r$-process events in both dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way,
and that it may be the dominant mechanism for production of $r$-process
elements in the Universe. The results are consistent with neutron star mergers
estimates, but cannot rule out other rare core collapse scenarios, provided
that they produce a significant amounts of $r$-process material per event.

exact matrix equation of motion that takes into account all the network
constraints of a purely memristive circuit, and we employ it to derive
analytical results regarding its relaxation properties. We are able to describe
the memory evolution in terms of orthogonal projection operators onto the
subspace of fundamental loop space of the underlying circuit. This orthogonal
projection explicitly reveals the coupling between the spatial and temporal
sectors of the memristive circuits and compactly describes the circuit
topology. For the case of disordered graphs, we are able to explain the
emergence of a power law relaxation as a superposition of exponential
relaxation times with a broad range of scales using random matrices. This power
law is also {\it universal}, namely independent of the topology of the
underlying graph but dependent only on the density of loops. In the case of
circuits subject to alternating voltage instead, we are able to obtain an
approximate solution of the dynamics, which is tested against a specific
network topology. These result suggest a much richer dynamics of memristive
networks than previously considered.

equivalent to the expectation value of energy for electron stationary quantum
states in a hydrogen atom. On the other hand, for superpositions of the
stationary quantum states, inequivalence between the gravitational masses and
energy appears at a macroscopic level. It reveals itself as time-dependent
oscillations of the expectation values of passive and active gravitational
masses, which can be, in principle, experimentally measured. Inequivalence
between passive gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level can be
experimentally observed as unusual electromagnetic radiation, emitted by a
macroscopic ensemble of the atoms. We propose the corresponding experiment,
which can be done on the Earth's orbit, using small spacecraft. If such
experiment is done it would be the first direct observation of quantum effects

on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is
affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues,
but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume
independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple
dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the
systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph
dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific
variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers
jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the
proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to
a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and

importance in terms of social security, stability and prosperity. It has become
clear that current networking standards fall short of coping with the complex
challenge of surviving failures. The need to address this challenge has become
a focal point of networking research. In particular, the concept of
\textbf{\emph{tunable survivability}} offers major performance improvements
over traditional approaches. Indeed, while the traditional approach aims at
providing full (100\%) protection against network failures through disjoint
paths, it was realized that this requirement is too restrictive in practice.
Tunable survivability provides a quantitative measure for specifying the
desired level (0\%-100\%) of survivability and offers flexibility in the choice
of the routing paths. Previous work focused on the simpler class of
""bottleneck"" criteria, such as bandwidth. In this study, we focus on the
important and much more complex class of \emph{additive} criteria, such as
delay and cost. First, we establish some (in part, counter-intuitive)
properties of the optimal solution. Then, we establish efficient algorithmic
schemes for optimizing the level of survivability under additive end-to-end QoS
bounds. Subsequently, through extensive simulations, we show that, at the price
of \emph{negligible} reduction in the level of survivability, a major
improvement (up to a factor of $2$) is obtained in terms of end-to-end QoS
performance. Finally, we exploit the above findings in the context of a network
design problem, in which, for a given investment budget, we aim to improve the
survivability of the network links.

incredibly impressive achievement of experimental physics. It is also a
tremendous success of the theory of General Relativity. It confirms the
existence of black holes; shows that binary black holes exist; that they may
collide and that during the merging process gravitational waves are produced.
These are all predictions of General Relativity theory in its fully nonlinear
regime. The existence of gravitational waves was predicted by Albert Einstein
in 1916 within the framework of linearized Einstein theory. Contrary to common
belief, even the very \emph{definition} of a gravitational wave in the fully
nonlinear Einstein theory was provided only after Einstein's death. Actually,
Einstein had arguments against the existence of nonlinear gravitational waves
(they were erroneous but he did not accept this), which virtually stopped
development of the subject until the mid 1950s. This is what we refer to as the
\emph{Red Light} for gravitational waves research. In the following years, the
theme was picked up again and studied vigorously by various experts, mainly
Herman Bondi, Felix Pirani, Ivor Robinson and Andrzej Trautman, where the
theoretical obstacles concerning gravitational wave existence were successfully
overcome, thus giving the `Green Light' for experimentalists to start designing
detectors, culminating in the recent LIGO/VIRGO discovery. In this note we tell
the story of this theoretical breakthrough. Particular attention is given to
the fundamental 1958 papers of Trautman, which seem to be lesser known outside
the circle of General Relativity experts. A more detailed technical description
of these 2 papers is given in the Appendix.

This paper aims to investigate whether the properties of an IM protostar within
the IRAS 05373+2349 embedded cluster are similar to that of low- and/or
high-mass protostars. We carried out Very Large Array as well as Combined Array
for Research in Millimeter Astronomy continuum and 12CO(J=1-0) observations,
which uncover seven radio continuum sources (VLA 1-7). The spectral index of
VLA 2, associated with the IM protostar is consistent with an ionised stellar
wind or jet. The source VLA 3 is coincident with previously observed H2
emission line objects aligned in the north-south direction (P.A. -20 to -12
deg), which may be either an ionised jet emanating from VLA 2 or
(shock-)ionised cavity walls in the large-scale outflow from VLA 2. The
position angle between VLA 2 and 3 is slightly misaligned with the large-scale
outflow we map at ~5-arcsec resolution in 12CO (P.A. ~30 deg), which in the
case of a jet suggests precession. The emission from the mm core associated
with VLA 2 is also detected; we estimate its mass to be 12-23 Msun, depending
on the contribution from ionised gas. Furthermore, the large-scale outflow has
properties intermediate between outflows from low- and high-mass young stars.
Therefore, we conclude that the IM protostar within IRAS 05373+2349 is
phenomenologically as well as quantitatively intermediate between the low- and
high-mass domains.

to all paddable languages, but still does not conflict with potential worst
case intractability. Note that the family of paddable languages apparently
includes all known natural NP-complete problems. We call our concept Roughly
Polynomial Time (RoughP). A language $L,$ over an at least 2-symbol alphabet,
is in RoughP, if the following hold: (1) there exists a bijective encoding
$\alpha$ of strings, such that both $\alpha$ and its inverse are computable in
polynomial time; (2) there is a polynomial time algorithm $\cal A$, which is an
errorless heuristic for $L,$ with exponentially vanishing failure rate relative
to the $\alpha$-spheres $S^{(\alpha)}_n=\{\alpha(x)\,|\;\, |x|=n\}$. It means,
$\cal A$ always correctly decides whether $x\in L$ or $x\notin L$, whenever it
outputs a decision. For some inputs, however, it may not output a decision,
rather it may return a special sign, meaning ""don't know."" But the latter can
happen only on an exponentially small fraction of each $\alpha$-sphere. We
prove that RoughP contains all paddable languages. This may contribute to the
explanation of the often observed gap between practical algorithm performance
and theoretical worst case analysis for hard problems. Furthermore, the proof
also provides a general method to construct the desired encoding and the
errorless heuristic. Additionally, we also show how to use it for efficiently
generating large, random, guaranteed positive and negative test instances for
any paddable language, including all known natural NP-complete problems. In
fact, it appears that every practical decision task (whether in NP or not) can
be represented by paddable languages, and, therefore, our RoughP framework
applies to all of them. We also explore some connections between RoughP and
other complexity classes.

contrast with Lyapunov-based control methods, this method does not require the
subsystems to have common equilibrium points. Algorithms are developed for
computing both outer and inner approximations of the maximal controlled
invariant sets, which are represented as finite unions of intervals. The
general convergence results of interval methods allow us to obtain arbitrarily
precise approximations without any stability assumptions. In addition,
invariant inner approximations can be computed provided that the switched
system satisfies a robustly controlled invariance condition. Under the same
condition, we also prove the existence of an invariance controller based on
partitions of the state space. Our method is illustrated with three examples

modern notion of local Lorentz invariance. However, as natural as this seems to
the physicist, most computer scientists would argue that something like a
""local linear tangent space"" is not very typical and in fact a quite surprising
property of any conceivable world or algorithm. In this paper, we take the
perspective of the computer scientist seriously, and ask whether there could be
any inherently information-theoretic reason to expect this notion of linearity
to appear in physics. We give a series of simple arguments, spanning quantum
information theory, group representation theory, and renormalization in quantum
gravity, that supports a surprising thesis: namely, that the local linearity of
space-time might ultimately be a consequence of the linearity of probabilities.
While our arguments involve a fair amount of speculation, they have the virtue
of being independent of any detailed assumptions on quantum gravity, and they
are in harmony with several independent recent ideas on emergent space-time in
high-energy physics.

partial quotients restricted to a given alphabet. In order to answer the
numerous questions that arrive from this conjecture, it is best to consider a
semi-group, often denoted $\Gamma_{A}$, which arises naturally as a subset of
$SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ when considering finite continued fractions. To translate
back from this semi-group into rational numbers, we select a projection mapping
satisfying certain criteria to recover the numerator and denominator of the
continued fractions in rational form. The central question of our research is
to determine the multiplicity of a given denominator. To this end, we develop a
heuristic method similar to the Hardy-Littlewood Circle Method. We compare this
theoretical model to the exact data, gleaned by simulation, and demonstrate
that our formula appears to be asymptotically valid. We then evaluate different
aspects of the accuracy of our formula.

number of spontaneous-emission events required to produce a stretched state,
thus reducing the population loss due to decay to other states. To produce a
stretched state in a manifold with angular momentum J, conventional optical

it to about one spontaneous decay, independent of J.

In an
anti-de Sitter space, we construct a pair of maximally entangled but separated
black holes. Due to the vacuum decay of the anti-de Sitter background toward a
deeper vacuum, these two parts can be trapped by bubbles. If these bubbles are
reasonably large, then within the scrambling time, there should appear an
Einstein-Rosen bridge between the two black holes. Now by tracing more details
on the bubble dynamics, one can identify parameters such that one of the two
bubbles either monotonically shrinks or expands. Because of the change of
vacuum energy, one side of the black hole would evaporate completely. Due to
the shrinking of the apparent horizon, a signal of one side of the
Einstein-Rosen bridge can be viewed from the opposite side. We analytically and
numerically demonstrate that within a reasonable semi-classical parameter
regime, such process can happen. Bubbles are a non-perturbative effect, which
is the crucial reason that allows the transmission of information between the
two black holes through the Einstein-Rosen bridge, even though the probability
is highly suppressed. Therefore, the ER=EPR conjecture cannot be generic in its
present form and its validity maybe restricted.

short-range physics at the vortex core level and the long-range hydrodynamical

Starting from an exact solution for an incompressible fluid, the hydrodynamic
equations are solved with a series expansion in a small tunable parameter
provided by the ratio of the healing length, characterizing the vortex cores,
to the slab width. The key dynamical properties of the vortex, the inertial and
physical masses, are well defined and renormalizable. They are calculated at
leading order beyond the logarithmic accuracy that has limited previous
approaches. Our results provide a solid framework for further detailed study of
the vortex mass and vortex forces in strongly-correlated and exotic

increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward
reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various
layers without hurting original accuracy. However, magnitude-based pruning of
weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected
layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional
layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an
acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are
identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole
filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the
computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights,
this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does
not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing
efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even
simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to
34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the
original accuracy by retraining the networks.

effective in these meetings, participants need to have an engaged mental state.
The mental state of participants however, is hidden from other participants,

process of thinking and feeling, that is formed of a conglomerate of mental
representations and propositional attitudes. There is a need to create
transparency of these hidden states to understand, evaluate and influence them.
Facilitators need to evaluate the meeting situation and adjust for higher
engagement and productivity. This paper presents a framework that defines a
spectrum of engagement states and an array of classifiers aimed to detect the
engagement state of participants in real time. The Engagement Framework
integrates multi-modal information from 2D and 3D imaging and sound. Engagement
is detected and evaluated at participants and aggregated at group level. We use
empirical data collected at the lab of Konica Minolta, Inc. to test initial
applications of this framework. The paper presents examples of the tested

cluster Ares 362 times using random selections of image systems with and
without spectroscopic redshifts and quantify the systematics using several
diagnostics: image predictability, accuracy of model-predicted redshifts,
enclosed mass, and magnification. We find that for models with $>15$ image
systems, the image plane rms does not decrease significantly when more systems
are added; however the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as
to the ability of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well
constrained near the Einstein radius in all cases, and systematic error drops
to $<2\%$ for models using $>10$ image systems. Magnification errors are
smallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of
the magnification is systematically lower near curved portions. For $>15$
systems, the systematic error on magnification is $\sim2\%$. We report no trend
in magnification error with fraction of spectroscopic image systems when
selecting constraints at random; however, when using the same selection of
constraints, increasing this fraction up to $\sim0.5$ will increase model
accuracy. The results suggest that the selection of constraints, rather than
quantity alone, determines the accuracy of the magnification. We note that
spectroscopic follow-up of at least a few image systems is crucial, as models
without any spectroscopic redshifts are inaccurate across all of our

external pressure around the GCMS. The ambient ionized gas may cause the
confinement and/or the perturbation for the orbits. There is a good positional

forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the

mortality rate forecasts from the viewpoint of grouped time-series forecasting
methods (Hyndman et al., 2011). A bottom-up method and an optimal combination
method are applied to produce point forecasts of infant mortality rates that
are aggregated appropriately across the different levels of a hierarchy. We
extend these two methods by considering the reconciliation of interval
forecasts through a bootstrap procedure. Using the regional infant mortality
rates in Australia, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 20-step-ahead point
and interval forecast accuracies among the independent and these two grouped
time-series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful
for reconciling point and interval forecasts of demographic rates at the
national and sub-national levels, and would be beneficial for government policy
decisions regarding the allocations of current and future resources at both the
national and sub-national levels.

g(t,x) :=\int_0^{t} \int_{R^d} K(t,s,x,y) g(s,y)dy dW_s $$ is a bounded
operator on $\mathbb{L}_p=L_p(\Omega \times (0,\infty); L_{p}(R^d))$ for any
$p\geq 2$ if it is bounded when $p=2$ and stochastic H\""ormander condition
holds. Here $\Omega$ is a probability space and $W_t$ is a Wiener process on
$\Omega$. Proving the $L_p$-boundedness of such integral operators is the key
step in constructing an $L_p$-theory for linear stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDEs in short).
  As a byproduct of our result on stochastic singular operators we obtain the
maximal $L_p$-regularity result for a very wide class of SPDEs.

demonstrated experimentally. One way to leverage full-duplex in a network
setting is to enable three-node full-duplex, where a full- duplex access point
(AP) transmits data to one node yet simultaneously receives data from another
node. Such three-node full-duplex communication however introduces inter-client
interference, directly impacting the full-duplex gain. It hence may not always
be beneficial to enable three-node full-duplex transmissions. In this paper, we
present a distributed full-duplex medium access control (MAC) protocol that
allows an AP to adaptively switch between full-duplex and half-duplex modes. We
formulate a model that determines the probabilities of full-duplex and
half-duplex access so as to maximize the expected network throughput. A MAC
protocol is further proposed to enable the AP and clients to contend for either
full-duplex or half-duplex transmissions based on their assigned probabilities
in a distributed way. Our evaluation shows that, by combining the advantages of
centralized probabilistic scheduling and distributed random access, our design
improves the overall throughput by 2.70x and 1.53x, on average, as compared to
half-duplex 802.11 and greedy downlink-uplink client pairing.

  Under Gravitational Field","21 pages, 9 figures, preprint",,"10.1016/j.jcp.2016.12.022",,"physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The gas dynamics under gravitational field is usually associated with the
multiple scale nature due to large density variation and a wide range of local
Knudsen number. It is chal- lenging to construct a reliable numerical algorithm
to accurately capture the non-equilibrium physical effect in different regimes.
In this paper, a well-balanced unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for all flow
regimes under gravitational field will be developed, which can be used for the
study of non-equilibrium gravitational gas system. The well-balanced scheme
here is defined as a method to evolve an isolated gravitational system under
any initial condition to an isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and to
keep such a solution. To preserve such a property is important for a numerical
scheme, which can be used for the study of slowly evolving gravitational
system, such as the formation of star and galaxy. Based on the Boltzmann model
with external forcing term, an analytic time evolving (or scale-dependent)
solution is constructed to provide the corresponding dynamics in the cell size
and time step scale, which is subsequently used in the construction of UGKS. As
a result, with the varia- tion of the ratio between the numerical time step and
local particle collision time, the UGKS is able to recover flow physics in
different regimes and provides a continuum spectrum of gas dynamics. For the
first time, the flow physics of a gravitational system in the transition regime
can be studied using the UGKS, and the non-equilibrium phenomena in such a
grav- itational system can be clearly identified. Many numerical examples will
be used to validate the scheme. New physical observation, such as the
correlation between the gravitational field and the heat flux in the transition
regime, will be presented. The current method provides an indispensable tool
for the study of non-equilibrium gravitational system.

possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then
augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second
dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \texttt{word2vec}

trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over

dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in
performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of

low-mass stars with degenerate cores where helium is ignited in a way of
flashes. Due to numerical difficulties, the models of produced sdBs are
generally constructed from more massive stars with non-degenerate cores,
leaving several uncertainties on the exact characteristics of sdB stars.
Employing MESA, we systematically studied the characteristics of sdBs produced
from the common envelope (CE) ejection channel, and found that the sdB stars
produced from the CE ejection channel appear to form two distinct groups on the
effective temperature-gravity diagram. One group (the flash-mixing model)
almost has no H-rich envelope and crows at the hottest temperature end of the
extremely horizontal branch (EHB), while the other group has significant H-rich
envelope and spreads over the whole canonical EHB region. The key factor for
the dichotomy of the sdB properties is the development of convection during the
first helium flash, which is determined by the interior structure of the star
after the CE ejection. For a given initial stellar mass and a given core mass
at the onset of the CE, if the CE ejection stops early, the star has a
relatively massive H-rich envelope, resulting in a canonical sdB generally. The
fact of only a few short-orbital-period sdB binaries being in the flash-mixing
sdB region and the lack of He-rich sdBs in short-orbital-period binaries
indicate that the flash mixing is not very often in the products of the CE
ejection. A falling back process after the CE ejection, similar to that
happened in nova, is an appropriate way of increasing the envelope mass, then
prevents the flash mixing.

all copies of files stored on it are lost. In this way, repeated failures may
lead to losses of files. The efficiency of such a network is directly related
to the performances of the mechanism used to duplicate files on servers. In
this paper we study the evolution of the network using a natural duplication
policy giving priority to the files with the least number of copies.
  We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the network when the number $N$ of

state space of the empirical distribution of the state of the network. A
stochastic model of the evolution of the network which has values in state

the user behavior in Layer II via a two-stage membership selection and network

design a partial price differentiation scheme for the operator in Layer I,
which generalizes both the complete price differentiation scheme and the single

partial pricing scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between the revenue and the

is extended over a few kpc in the IR-bright galaxies. The AGN contribution to
the total IR luminosity of IR-bright galaxies is lower than in quasars.
Although the dust distribution is predicted to change as IR-bright galaxies
evolve to IR-bright quasars and then to optical quasars, we show that the AGN
mid-IR emission of all the quasars in our sample is not significantly
different. In contrast, the nuclear emission of IR-bright galaxies with low AGN
contributions appears more heavily embedded in dust although there is no clear
trend with the interaction stage or projected nuclear separation. This suggests
that the changes in the distribution of the nuclear obscuring material may be
taking place rapidly and at different interaction stages washing out the
evidence of an evolutionary path. When compared to normal AGN, the nuclear star
formation activity of quasars appears to be dimming whereas it is enhanced in
some IR-bright nuclei, suggesting that the latter are in an earlier
star-formation dominated phase.

of planets undergoing runaway gas accretion in radiative discs. We consider
accreting disc models with constant mass flux through the disc, and where
radiative cooling balances the effect of viscous heating and stellar
irradiation. We assume that 20-30 $M_\oplus$ giant planet cores are formed in
the region where viscous heating dominates and migrate outward under the action
of a strong corotation torque. In the case where gas accretion is neglected, we
find evidence for strong dynamical torques in accreting discs with accretion
rates ${\dot M}\gtrsim 7\times 10^{-8} \;M_\odot/yr$. Their main effect is to
increase outward migration rates by a factor of $\sim 2$ typically. In the
presence of gas accretion, however, runaway outward migration is observed with
the planet passing through the zero-torque radius and the transition between
the viscous heating and stellar heating dominated regimes. The ability for an
accreting planet to enter a fast migration regime is found to depend strongly
on the planet growth rate, but can occur for values of the mass flux through
the disc of ${\dot M}\gtrsim 5\times 10^{-8} \;M_\odot/yr$. We find that an
episode of runaway outward migration can cause an accreting planet formed in
the 5-10 AU region to temporarily orbit at star-planet separations as large as
$\sim$60-70 AU. However, increase in the amplitude of the Lindblad torque
associated with planet growth plus change in the streamline topology near the
planet systematically cause the direction of migration to be reversed. Our
results indicate that a planet can reach large orbital distances under the
combined effect of dynamical torques and gas accretion, but an alternative
mechanism is required to explain the presence of massive planets on wide
orbits.

- in integrated circuits has recently drawn a lot of attention, since phonons
can function as unique links between radiofrequency and optical signals, allow
access to quantum regimes and offer advanced signal processing capabilities.
Recent approaches based on optomechanical resonators have achieved impressive
quality factors allowing for storage of optical signals. However, so far these
techniques have been limited in bandwidth and are incompatible with
multi-wavelength operation. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a
coherent buffer in an integrated planar optical waveguide by transferring the
optical information coherently to an acoustic hypersound wave. Optical
information is extracted using the reverse process. These hypersound phonons
have similar wavelengths as the optical photons but travel at 5-orders of
magnitude lower velocity. We demonstrate the storage of phase and amplitude of
optical information with GHz-bandwidth and show operation at separate
wavelengths with negligible cross-talk.

intelligences (ETIs) have agreed to not contact the Earth. The strength of this
solution depends on the ability for ETIs to come to agreement, and
establish/police treaties as part of a so-called ""Galactic Club"". These
activities are principally limited by the causal connectivity of a civilisation
to its neighbours at its inception, i.e. whether it comes to prominence being
aware of other ETIs and any treaties or agreements in place.
  If even one civilisation is not causally connected to the other members of a
treaty, then they are free to operate beyond it and contact the Earth if
wished, which makes the Zoo solution ""soft"". We should therefore consider how
likely this scenario is, as this will give us a sense of the Zoo solution's
softness, or general validity.
  We implement a simple toy model of ETIs arising in a Galactic Habitable Zone,
and calculate the properties of the groups of culturally connected
civilisations established therein. We show that for most choices of
civilisation parameters, the number of culturally connected groups is greater
than 1, meaning that the Galaxy is composed of multiple Galactic Cliques rather
than a single Galactic Club. We find in our models for a single Galactic Club
to establish interstellar hegemony, the number of civilisations must be
relatively large, the mean civilisation lifetime must be several millions of
years, and the inter-arrival time between civilisations must be a few million
years or less.

the number of nodes increases. In general, the way to construct a theoretically
optimal solution is unknown. However, it is known that some methods can
construct suboptimal networks with low-latency. One such method is to construct
large-scale networks from optimal or suboptimal small networks, using the
product of graphs. There are two major advantages to this method. One is that
we can reuse small, already known networks to construct large-scale networks.
The other is that the networks obtained by this method have graph-theoretical
symmetry, which reduces the overhead of communication between nodes. A network
can be viewed as a graph, which is a mathematical term from combinatorics. The
design of low-latency networks can be treated as a mathematical problem of
finding small diameter graphs with a given number of nodes ( called order ) and
a given number of connections between each node ( called degree ). In this
paper, we overview how to construct large graphs from optimal or suboptimal
small graphs by using graph-theoretical products. We focus on the case of
diameter 2 in particular. As an example, we introduce a graph of order 256,
degree 22 and diameter 2, which granted us the Deepest Improvement Award at the

the W43 MM1 region covering the main low-energy water lines at 557, 987, and
1113 GHz, their H$_2^{18}$O counterparts, and other lines such as
$^{13}$CO(10-9) and C$^{18}$O(9-8) which trace warm gas. These water lines are,
with the exception of line wings, observed in absorption. Herschel SPIRE and
JCMT 450 $\mu$m data have been used to make a model of the continuum emission
at these wavelengths. Analysis of the maps, and in particular the optical depth
maps of each line and feature, shows that a velocity gradient, possibly due to
rotation, is present in both the envelope and the protostellar core. Velocities
increase in both components from SW to NE, following the general source
orientation. While the H$_2$O lines trace essentially the cool envelope, we
show that the envelope cannot account for the H$_2^{18}$O absorption, which
traces motions close to the protostar. The core has rapid infall, 2.9 kms, as
manifested by the H$_2^{18}$O absorption features which are systematically
red-shifted with respect to the $^{13}$CO(10-9) emission line which also traces
the inner material with the same angular resolution. Some H$_2^{18}$O
absorption is detected outside the central core and thus outside the regions
expected to be above 100 K - we attribute this to warm gas associated with the
other massive dense cores in W43 MM1. Using the maps to identify absorption
from cool gas on large scales, we subtract this component to model spectra for
the inner envelope. Modeling the new spectra results in a lower water
abundance, decreased from $8 10^{-8}$ to $8 10^{-9}$ , with no change in infall
rate.

defines the provability relation among resources in those locations. It is well
known that SELL, as a logical framework, is strictly more expressive than LL.

while momentum relaxation leads to a non-critical correction. We also show that
decrease of the correlation length causes: the phase transition of holographic
mutual information to happen at smaller separations and the
confinement/deconfinement phase transition to take place at smaller critical
lengths. The effective potential between point like external objects also gets
corrected. We show that the strength of the corresponding force between these
objects is an increasing function of the momentum relaxation parameter.

latency and energy efficiency of deep neural networks through event-based
computation. However, training such networks is difficult due to the
non-differentiable nature of asynchronous spike events. In this paper, we
introduce a novel technique, which treats the membrane potentials of spiking
neurons as differentiable signals, where discontinuities at spike times are
only considered as noise. This enables an error backpropagation mechanism for
deep SNNs, which works directly on spike signals and membrane potentials. Thus,
compared with previous methods relying on indirect training and conversion, our
technique has the potential to capture the statics of spikes more precisely.
Our novel framework outperforms all previously reported results for SNNs on the
permutation invariant MNIST benchmark, as well as the N-MNIST benchmark
recorded with event-based vision sensors.

fracture characteristics of an ultra high performance concrete (UHPC). The
study is based on a unique set of experimental data connecting aging tests for
two curing protocols of one size and scaled size effect tests of one age. Both
aging and size effect studies are performed on notched three point bending
tests. Experimental data is augmented by state of the art simulations employing
a recently developed discrete element based early-age computational framework.
The framework is constructed by coupling a hygro-thermo-chemical (HTC) model
and the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) through a set of aging
functions. The HTC component allows taking into account variable curing
conditions and predicts the maturity of concrete. The mechanical component,
LDPM, simulates the failure behavior of concrete at the length scale of major
heterogeneities. After careful calibration and validation the mesoscale
HTC-LDPM model is uniquely posed to perform predictive simulations. The
ultimate flexural strengths from experiments and simulations are analyzed by
the cohesive size effect curve (CSEC) method, and the classical size effect law
(SEL). The fracture energies obtained by LDPM, CSEC, SEL, and cohesive crack
analyses are compared and an aging formulation for fracture properties is
proposed. Based on experiments, simulations, and size effect analyses, the
age-dependence of size effect and the robustness of analytical size effect
methods are evaluated.

effective in the large $\tan\beta$ regime. Enhanced genuine-NMSSM contributions
in double penguins are expected for a light singlet spectrum (CP-even,CP-odd),

mixing. The latter is found to be typically subleading (but non-negligible) for
$\lambda \lesssim 0.5$, however it can become dominant for $\lambda\sim

interacting Fermi gas at the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
superfluids to Bose-Einstein condensates, by developing an improved random
phase approximation within the framework of a density functional theory - the
so-called superfluid local density approximation. Compared with the previous
random-phase-approximation studies based on the standard Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations, the use of the density functional theory greatly improves the
accuracy of the equation of state at the crossover, and leads to a better
description of both collective Bogoliubov-Anderson-Goldstone phonon mode and
single-particle fermionic excitations at small transferred momentum. Near
unitarity, where the s-wave scattering length diverges, we show that the
single-particle excitations start to significantly contribute to the spectrum
of dynamic structure factor once the frequency is above a threshold of the
energy gap at $2\Delta$. The sharp rise in the spectrum at this threshold can
be utilized to measure the pairing gap $\Delta$. Together with the sound
velocity determined from the phonon branch, the dynamic structure factor
provides us some key information of the crossover Fermi superfluid. Our
predictions could be examined in experiments with $^{6}$Li or $^{40}$K atoms

of Service (QoS) guarantees has been a challenging research problem with ever
growing complexity. Several heuristic based approaches with diverse proposals
for taming the scale and complexity of web service composition, have been
proposed in literature. In this paper, we present a new approach for efficient
service composition based on abstraction refinement. Instead of considering
individual services during composition, we propose several abstractions to form
service groups and the composition is done on these abstract services.
Abstraction reduces the search space significantly and thereby can be done
reasonably fast. While this can expedite solution construction to a great
extent, this also entails a possibility that it may fail to generate any
solution satisfying the QoS constraints, though the individual services
construct a valid solution. Hence, we propose to refine an abstraction to
generate the composite solution with desired QoS values. A QoS satisfying
solution, if one exists, can be constructed with multiple iterations of
abstraction refinement. While in the worst case, this approach may end up
exploring the complete composition graph constructed on individual services, on
an average, the solution can be achieved on the abstract graph. The abstraction
refinement techniques give a significant speed-up compared to the traditional
composition techniques. Experimental results on real benchmarks show the
efficiency of our proposed mechanism in terms of time and the number of
services considered for composition.

from those of other BHBs, the spectral evolution of V404~Cyg in hard X-rays and
the relations between the spectral parameters are consistent with those
observed in other BHBs. We identify a hard branch} where the electron
temperature is anti-correlated with the hard X-ray flux, and a soft flaring
branch where the relation reverses. In addition, we find that during long X-ray
plateaus detected at intermediate fluxes, the thermal Comptonization models
fail to describe the spectra. However, the statistics improve if we allow the
absorption to vary freely in the fits to these spectra. Conclusions. We
conclude that the hard branch in V404 Cyg is analogous to the canonical hard
state of BHBs. V404~Cyg never seems to enter the canonical soft state, although
the soft flaring branch bears resemblance to the BHB intermediate state and
ultra-luminous state. The X-ray plateaus are likely the result of absorption by
a Compton-thick outflow which reduces the observed flux by a factor of about
10.[abridged]

frequencies, the effective reservoir may appear as a quantum squeezed field of
ordinary or inverted harmonic oscillators. When the Rabi frequencies are equal
the effective reservoir appears as a perfectly squeezed field in which the
decay of one of the polarization quadratures of the quantum dot dipole moment
is inhibited. The decay of the quantum dot to a stationary state which depends
on the initial coherence is predicted. This unusual result is shown to be a
consequence of a quantum-nondemolition type coupling of the quantum dot to the
engineered squeezed reservoir. The effect of the initial coherence on the
steady-state dressed-state population distribution and the fluorescence

Hall cascade (Cumming, Arras and Zweibel 2004; Wareing and Hollerbach 2009)
hinted that energy in small scales structures should dissipate on short
timescales. Our new 2D magneto-thermal simulations suggest the opposite. For
the first $\sim$10 kyrs after the fall-back episode with accreted mass $10^{-3}
M_\odot$, the observed NS magnetic field appears dipolar, which is insensitive
to the initial magnetic topology. In framework of the Ruderman & Sutherland
(1975) vacuum gap model during this interval, non-thermal radiation is strongly
suppressed. After this time the initial (i.e. multipolar) structure begins to
re-emerge through the NS crust. We distinguish three evolutionary epochs for
the re-emergence process: the growth of internal toroidal field, the advection
of buried poloidal field, and slow Ohmic diffusion. The efficiency of the first
two stages can be enhanced when small-scale magnetic structure is present. The
efficient re-emergence of high order harmonics might significantly affect the
curvature of the magnetospheric field lines in the emission zone. So, only
after few $10^4$ yrs would the NS starts shining as a pulsar again, which is in
correspondence with radio silence of central compact objects (CCOs). In
addition, these results can explain the absence of good candidates for
thermally emitting NSs with freshly re-emerged field among radio pulsars
(Bogdanov, Ng and Kaspi 2014), as NSs have time to cool down, and supernova
remnants can already dissipate.

allowing these coefficients to be measured in the presence of noise and
allowing a clear route for marginalisation over mean flux. Moreover, in the
presence of noise, our numerical work shows that a finite number of

dominance. This compresses the available information into a small number of
well-measured quantities. We find that the amount of recoverable information is
a very non-linear function of spectral noise that strongly favors fewer quasars

$K$ of characteristic $p \geq 0$ and let $V$ be an irreducible rational
$G$-module with highest weight $\lambda$. When $V$ is self-dual, a basic
question to ask is whether $V$ has a non-degenerate $G$-invariant alternating
bilinear form or a non-degenerate $G$-invariant quadratic form.
  If $p \neq 2$, the answer is well known and easily described in terms of
$\lambda$. In the case where $p = 2$, we know that if $V$ is self-dual, it
always has a non-degenerate $G$-invariant alternating bilinear form. However,
determining when $V$ has a non-degenerate $G$-invariant quadratic form is a
classical problem that still remains open. We solve the problem in the case
where $G$ is of classical type and $\lambda$ is a fundamental highest weight
$\omega_i$, and in the case where $G$ is of type $A_l$ and $\lambda = \omega_r
+ \omega_s$ for $1 \leq r < s \leq l$. We also give a solution in some specific
cases when $G$ is of exceptional type.
  As an application of our results, we refine Seitz's $1987$ description of
maximal subgroups of simple algebraic groups of classical type. One consequence
of this is the following result. If $X < Y < \operatorname{SL}(V)$ are simple
algebraic groups and $V \downarrow X$ is irreducible, then one of the following
holds: (1) $V \downarrow Y$ is not self-dual; (2) both or neither of the

input signal with an additive noise that is independent of the input. The
decoherence of a quantum-mechanical state as a result of optical amplification
is usually assumed to be due to the addition of quantum noise. Here we show
that entanglement between the input signal and the amplifying medium can
produce an exponentially-large amount of decoherence in an ideal optical
amplifier even when the gain is arbitrarily close to unity and the added noise
is negligible. These effects occur for macroscopic superposition states, where
even a small amount of gain can leave a significant amount of which-path
information in the environment. Our results show that the usual input/output
relation of a linear amplifier does not provide a complete description of the
output state when post-selection is used.

estimated coefficients, the efficiency of which relies on the large sample
properties of the estimator, it is a common perception that prediction is
practically impossible for such short series with structural break. However, we
obtain a heuristic result that some universal predictors represented in the
frequency domain allow certain predictability based on these ultra short
sequences. The predictors that we use are universal in a sense that they are
not oriented on particular types of autoregressions and do not require explicit
modelling of structural break. The shorter the sequence, the better the
one-step-ahead forecast performance of the smoothed predicting kernel. If the
structural break entails a model parameter switch from negative to positive
value, the forecast performance of the smoothed predicting kernel is better
than that of the linear predictor that utilize AR(1) coefficient estimated from
the ultra short sequence without taking the structural break into account

a smart material called ferrogel. It responds to an applied external magnetic
field by changes in elastic properties, which can be exploited for various
applications like dampers, vibration absorbers, or actuators. Under appropriate
conditions, the stress-strain behavior of a ferrogel can display a fascinating
feature: superelasticity, the capability to reversibly deform by a huge amount
while barely altering the applied load. In a previous work, using numerical
simulations, we investigated this behavior assuming that the magnetic moments
carried by the embedded particles can freely reorient to minimize their
magnetic interaction energy. Here, we extend the analysis to ferrogels where
restoring torques by the surrounding matrix hinder rotations towards a
magnetically favored configuration. For example, the particles can be
chemically cross-linked into the polymer matrix and the magnetic moments can be
fixed to the particle axes. We demonstrate that these systems still feature a
superelastic regime. As before, the nonlinear stress-strain behavior can be
reversibly tailored during operation by external magnetic fields. Yet, the
different coupling of the magnetic moments causes different types of response
to external stimuli. For instance, an external magnetic field applied parallel
to the stretching axis hardly affects the superelastic regime but stiffens the
system beyond it. Other smart materials featuring superelasticity, e.g.
metallic shape-memory alloys, have already found widespread applications. Our
soft polymer systems offer many additional advantages like a typically higher
deformability and enhanced biocompatibility combined with high tunability.

Poisson processes is considered. The jumps arrive with exponential waiting
times and are allowed to be two-sided. The jumps are assumed to form an iid
sequence with distribution a mixture (not necessarily convex) of exponential
distributions, independent of everything else. The fact that downward jumps are
allowed makes passage of a given lower level possible both by continuity and by
a jump. The time of this passage and the possible undershoot (in the jump case)
is considered. By finding partial eigenfunctions for the infinitesimal
generator of the process, an expression for the joint Laplace transform of the
passage time and the undershoot can be found.
  From the Laplace transform the ruin probability of ever crossing the level
can be derived. When the drift is negative this probability is less than one
and its asymptotic behaviour when the initial state of the process tends to
infinity is determined explicitly.
  The situation where the level to cross decreases to minus infinity is more
involved: The level to cross plays a much more fundamental role in the
expression for the joint Laplace transform than the initial state of the
process. The limit of the ruin probability in the positive drift case and the
limit of the distribution of the undershoot in the negative drift case is
derived.

define, study, and compare different natural choices for balance functions and

spectra. The Ly$\alpha$ emission line is redshifted by 100-200 km/s compared to
the systemic redshift given by the [CII] line. These velocity offsets are
smaller than what is observed in z~3 Lyman break galaxies with similar UV
luminosities and emission line properties. Smaller velocity shifts reduce the
visibility of Ly$\alpha$ and hence somewhat alleviate the need for a very
neutral IGM at z~7 to explain the drop in the fraction of Ly$\alpha$ emitters
observed at this epoch.
  The galaxies show [CII] emission with L[CII]=0.6-1.6 x10$^8 L_\odot$: these
luminosities place them consistently below the SFR-L[CII] relation observed for
low redshift star forming and metal poor galaxies and also below z =5.5 Lyman
break galaxies with similar star formation rates. We argue that previous
undetections of [CII] in z~7 galaxies with similar or smaller star formation
rates are due to selection effects: previous targets were mostly strong

understand the principle of urban growth, a number of shape indexes are

of a shape index is often influenced by the resolution of remote sensing images
or digital maps because the calculated values depend on spatial measurement
scales. This paper is devoted to exploring the scaling in classical shape
indexes with mathematical methods. Two typical regular fractals, Koch's island
and Vicsek's figure, are employed to illustrate the property of scale
dependence of many shape indexes. A set of formula are derived from the
geometric measure relation to associate fractal dimension for boundary lines
with shape indexes. Based on the ideas of fractals, two main problems are
solved in this work. First, several different correlated shape indexes such as
circularity ratios and compactness ratios are normalized and unified by
substituting Feret's diameter for the major axis of urban figure. Second, three
levels of scaling in shape indexes are revealed, and shape indexes are
classified into three groups. The significance of this study lies in two
aspects. One is helpful for realizing the deep structure of urban form, and the
other is useful for clarifying the spheres of application of different types of

public data from the IceCube detector between 2008 and 2009 have been also

from Lorentz Invariance Violation effects and some astrophysical models. No
significant excess over the expected accidental coincidence rate could be found

of a single chiral multiplet, which can be identified with the string dilaton
or a compactification modulus. The model allows for a tunably small and
positive value of the cosmological constant. The gravitino mass parameter and
the dilaton Vacuum Expectation Value are separately tunable.
  In a second part we analyze the quantum consistency of these models. Recent
work on anomalies in supergravity theories with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms was
extended, such that their results can be interpreted from a field-theoretic
point of view. We show that for certain values of the parameters the anomaly
cancellation conditions are inconsistent with a TeV gravitino mass.
  In the third part the above model is used as a hidden sector for
supersymmetry breaking. In its minimal version, the model leads to tachyonic
scalar soft masses. This problem can however be circumvented by the
introduction of an extra Pol\'onyi-like hidden sector field, or by allowing for
non-canonical kinetic terms for the Standard Model fields, while maintaining
the desirable features of the model. The resulting low energy spectrum consists
of very light neutralinos, charginos and gluinos, while the squarks remain
heavy, with the exception of the stop squark which can be as light as 2 TeV.
  Finally, we discus possibility that the shift symmetry is identified with
known global symmetries of the MSSM. The particular cases where this global
symmetry is Baryon minus Lepton number ($B-L$), or $3B-L$, which contain the
known R-parity or matter parity of the MSSM, are analyzed in great detail. It
is shown that the phenomenology is similar to the above case where the MSSM
fields are inert, with the exception of the stop squark, which can be as light
as $1.5$ TeV.

SED lies outside the Herschel spectral range, it is only by incorporating data
from other observatories and epochs that we can perform useful fitting; with
this we explicitly assume no evolution of the point source between the epochs.
We find warm dust with a temperature of ~300K distributed over a radius of
150-200AU. PACS and SPIRE spectra were also used to detect emission lines from
the extended environment around the star. We fit the far-infrared lines of CO
arising from the point source, from an extended environment around V838 Mon.
Assuming a model of a spherical shell for this gas, we find that the CO appears
to arise from two temperature zones: a cold zone (Tkin ~18K) that could be
associated with the ISM or possibly with a cold layer in the outermost part of
the shell, and a warm (Tkin ~400K) zone that is associated with the extended
environment of V838 Mon within a region of radius of ~210AU. The SiO lines
arise from a warm/hot zone. We did not fit the lines of H2O as they are far
more dependent on the model assumed.

The observations $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are thereby supposed to follow a noisy
single-index model, depending on a certain set of signal variables. A major
difficulty is that these variables usually cannot be observed directly, but
rather arise as hidden factors in the actual data vectors $x_i \in
\mathbb{R}^d$ (feature variables). We will prove that a successful variable
selection is still possible in this setup, even when the applied estimator does
not have any knowledge of the underlying model parameters and only takes the
'raw' samples $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ as input. The model
assumptions of our results will be fairly general, allowing for non-linear
observations, arbitrary convex signal structures as well as strictly convex
loss functions. This is particularly appealing for practical purposes, since in
many applications, already standard methods, e.g., the Lasso or logistic
regression, yield surprisingly good outcomes. Apart from a general discussion
of the practical scope of our theoretical findings, we will also derive a
rigorous guarantee for a specific real-world problem, namely sparse feature
extraction from (proteomics-based) mass spectrometry data.

$M_* \sim{} 5\times{}10^{10} $ M$_\odot$ , selected using near-infrared
photometry (distant red galaxies, extremely red objects, sBzK-galaxies, and
galaxies selected on photometric redshift).
  We find that the typical sizes of these galaxies are ~0.6 arcsec which
corresponds to ~5 kpc at z~2, this agrees well with the median sizes measured
in the near-infrared z-band (~0.6 arcsec). We find errors on our size estimates
of ~0.1-0.2 arcsec, which agree well with the expected errors for model fitting
at the given signal-to-noise ratio. With the uv-coverage of our observations
(18-160 m), the size and flux density measurements are sensitive to scales out
to 2 . We compare this to a simulated ALMA Cycle 3 dataset with intermediate
length baseline coverage, and we find that, using only these baselines, the

of interesting and potentially useful processes. If a crystalline optical
potential is also linearly ramped, light can undergo periodic Bloch
oscillations, a direct outcome of localized Wannier-Stark states and their
equidistant eigenvalue spectrum. Even though these effects have been
extensively explored in conservative settings, this is by no means the case in
non-Hermitian photonic lattices encompassing both amplification and
attenuation. Quite recently, Bloch oscillations have been predicted in
parity-time-symmetric structures involving gain and loss in a balanced fashion.
While in a complex bulk medium, one intuitively expects that light will
typically follow the path of highest amplification, in a periodic system this
behavior can be substantially altered by the underlying band structure. Here,
we report the first experimental observation of Bloch oscillations in
parity-time-symmetric mesh lattices. We show that these revivals exhibit
unusual properties like secondary emissions and resonant restoration of PT
symmetry. In addition, we present a versatile method for reconstructing the
real and imaginary components of the band structure by directly monitoring the
light evolution during a cycle of these oscillations.

A common practice in supervised machine learning, is thus to test if the

signal detection is particularly popular in neuroimaging and genetics. We

an underpowered strategy for finding differences between populations, compared

a statistical test. Via simulation, we compare test statistics that are based
on classification accuracy, to others based on multivariate test statistics. We
find that probability of detecting differences between two distributions is
lower for accuracy based statistics. We examine several candidate causes for
the low power of accuracy tests. These causes include: the discrete nature of
the accuracy test statistic, the type of signal accuracy tests are designed to
detect, their inefficient use of the data, and their regularization. When the

radiation efficiency with $R_e\equiv\epsilon_{\rm e, r}/\epsilon_{\rm e, f}$,

which only one edge channel is transmitted and n channels are trapped into the
interferometer loop. Addressing recent experimental observations, we assume
that Coulomb blockade effects are completely suppressed due to screening, while
keeping track of a residual strong short range electron-electron interaction
between the co-propagating edge channels trapped into the interferometer loop.
This kind of interaction can be completely described in the framework of the
edge-magnetoplasmon scattering matrix theory allowing us to evaluate the
backscattering current and the associated differential conductance as a
function of the bias voltage. The remarkable features of these quantities are
discussed as a function of the number of trapped channels. The developed
formalism reveals very general and provides also a simple way to model the
experimentally relevant geometry in which some of the trapped channels are
absorbed into an Ohmic contact, leading to energy dissipation.

Monocrystalline silicon has a low-loss tangent and repeatable dielectric

its low specific heat. In a detector pixel, two Transition-Edge Sensor (TES)
bolometers are antenna-coupled to in-band radiation via a symmetric planar
orthomode transducer (OMT). Each orthogonal linear polarization is coupled to a
separate superconducting microstrip transmission line circuit. On-chip
filtering is employed to both reject out-of-band radiation from the upper band
edge to the gap frequency of the niobium superconductor, and to flexibly define
the bandwidth for each TES to meet the requirements of the application. The
microwave circuit is compatible with multi-chroic operation. Metalized silicon
platelets are used to define the backshort for the waveguide probes. This
micro-machined structure is also used to mitigate the coupling of out-of-band
radiation to the microwave circuit. At 40 GHz, the detectors have a measured

rate of their convective envelope, which could lead to strong dynamo-triggered
magnetic fields. Aims. We explore the possibility of generating magnetic fields
in red giants that have gone through the process of a planet engulfment. We
compare them with similar models that evolve without any planets. We discuss
the impact of stellar wind magnetic braking on the evolution of the surface
velocity of the parent star. Methods. With rotating stellar models with and
without planets and an empirical relation between the Rossby number and the
surface magnetic field, we deduce the evolution of the surface magnetic field
along the red-giant branch. The effects of wind magnetic braking is explored
using a relation deduced from MHD simulations. Results. The stellar evolution
model of a 1.7 M$_\odot$ without planet engulfment and that has a time-averaged
rotation velocity during the Main-Sequence equal to 100 km s$^{-1}$, shows a
surface magnetic field triggered by convection larger than 10 G only at the
base of the red giant branch, that means for gravities log $g > 3$. When a
planet engulfment occurs, such magnetic field can also appear at much lower
gravities, i.e. at much higher luminosities along the red giant branch.
Typically the engulfment of a 15 M$_J$ planet produces a dynamo triggered
magnetic field larger than 10 G for gravities between 2.5 and 1.9. We show that
for reasonable wind magnetic braking laws, the high surface velocity reached
after a planet engulfment may be maintained sufficiently long for being
observable. Conclusions. High surface magnetic fields for red giants in the
upper part of the red giant branch is a strong indication of a planet
engulfment or of an interaction with a companion. Our theory can be tested by
observing fast rotating red giants and check whether they show magnetic fields.

developing immediately after photoexcitation and lasting few picoseconds. For
both the insulating and the metallic phase, the formation of the transient
configuration is triggered by the excitation of electrons into the bonding a1g

inflation, in the sense of not altering the viable region in the $n_s-r$ plane,

a nontrivial way, for an inflaton coupled to additional spectator degrees of

(pseudo-)optimally, thereby avoiding unphysical large logarithmic corrections
to the Friedmann equations and large running of the couplings. We find that the
viable range of parameters of the potential is altered relative to the
classical limit, and we find an upper limit of $g\simeq 10^{-4}$ on the value
of the inflaton-spectator portal coupling still allowing for inflation. And an

theory predicts that these active swimmers disperse in a markedly distinct

nonzero drift and effective diffusivity that is non-monotonic with P$\'e$clet

present a new experimental method to measure gyrotactic dispersion using

by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently developed approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastic differential equations, or stochastics, (STS) identifies this phase
as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase), i.e., the phase where the topological
supersymmetry pertaining to all stochastic dynamical systems is broken
spontaneously by the condensation of the noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here,
we support this picture in the context of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of
neuron-like elements and find that the dynamics in the N-phase is indeed
featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov exponents and dominated by
(anti)instantonic processes of (creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks,
which can be viewed as predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also
construct the phase diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey
neuromorphic hardware and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in
the deterministic limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the
application of STS to neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain
can reside only in the N-phase.

future gravitational waves observatory in space eLISA, with the aim of measure
the differential acceleration between free-falling test masses orbiting in the

can't follow the two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to
follow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation force applied to
compensate this effect introduces a dominant source of force noise in the
mission noise budget at frequency near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode
actuation control scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and
avoid actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic impulses,
with test masses in free fall in between two kicks. This actuation-free motion
is then analyzed for the remaining sources of acceleration ultra noise. A
free-fall mode parallel testing has been successfully implemented on torsion
pendulum facility at the University of Trento and the results of the
measurement campaign are ready to be shown and discussed. The implementation of
the data analysis algorithms to estimate the spectrum of the acceleration of
the controlled test mass, and the estimation of system parameters such as the
force gradients, stiffness terms, are also part of this work. The free-fall

corresponding to an acceleration of about 100 fm /s-2 Hz-1/2. The ground tests
have nevertheless allowed to develop and test quantitatively this innovative

at the expansion and perturbation levels. Initially, using the latest
cosmological data we implement a joint likelihood analysis in order to
constrain the cosmological parameters. Then we test the performance of the
agegraphic dark energy model at the perturbation level and we define its
difference from the usual $\Lambda$CDM model. Within this context, we verify
that the growth index of matter fluctuations depends on the choice of the
considered agegraphic dark energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular,
assuming a homogeneous agegraphic dark energy we find, for the first time, that
the asymptotic value of the growth index is $\gamma \approx 5/9$, which is
close to that of the usual $\Lambda$ cosmology, $\gamma^{(\Lambda)} \approx
6/11$. Finally, if the distribution of dark energy is clustered then we obtain
$\gamma \approx 1/2$ which is $\sim 8\%$ smaller than that of the $\Lambda$CDM
model.

  added",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present paper is based upon equations obtained in an earlier paper by the
author devoted to a new formulation of quantum electrodynamics. The equations
describe the structure of the electron as well as its motion in external
fields, interaction with a measuring apparatus inclusive, in a deterministic
manner without any jumps. Quantum mechanics is an approximate theory because
its equations follow from the above equations upon neglecting the self-field of
the electron itself. Just this leads to paradoxes, seeming contradictions and
jumps in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical wavefunction has a dual
interpretation. In some problems the square of its modulus represents a real
distribution of the electronic density while in others the same square
determines the probability distribution of coordinates. It is shown why, given
the different interpretations of the wavefunction, it satisfies one and the
same Dirac or Schr\""odinger equation. Description of many-electron systems is
also considered in the starting approach as well as in quantum mechanics.
Neutrinos are discussed in brief.

  Study on Diabetes Self-care Factors",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the chronic nature of diabetes, patient self-care factors play an
important role in any treatment plan. In order to understand the behaviour of
patients in response to medical advice on self-care, clinicians often conduct
cross-sectional surveys. When analysing the survey data, statistical machine
learning methods can potentially provide additional insight into the data
either through deeper understanding of the patterns present or making
information available to clinicians in an intuitive manner. In this study, we
use self-organising maps (SOMs) to visualise the responses of patients who
share similar responses to survey questions, with the goal of helping
clinicians understand how patients are managing their treatment and where
action should be taken. The principle behavioural patterns revealed through
this are that: patients who take the correct dose of insulin also tend to take
their injections at the correct time, patients who eat on time also tend to
correctly manage their food portions and patients who check their blood glucose
with a monitor also tend to adjust their insulin dosage and carry snacks to
counter low blood glucose. The identification of these positive behavioural
patterns can also help to inform treatment by exploiting their negative
corollaries.
