bright stars located in the Kepler field of view. The stars, spectral type FK,
show evidence for rapid rotation including chromospheric activity 100 times or
more above the Sun at maximum and flaring behavior in their light curves.
Eighteen of our objects appear to be (sub)giants and may belong to the class of
FK Com variables, that is evolved rapidly spinning single stars with no
excretion disk and high levels of chromospheric activity. Such stars are rare
and are likely the result of W UMa binary mergers, a process believed to
produce the FK Com class of variable and their descendants. The FK Com stage,
including the presence of an excretion disk, is short-lived but leads to
longer-lived stages consisting of single, rapidly rotating evolved (sub)giants
with high levels of stellar activity.

shows the formation of a non-thermal feature in the case of lower plasma beta,

dominates the E_{\perp}.J_{\perp} term. Regions of strong

interesting problem in spectral graph theory. Seidel switching is a well-known
method for generating co-spectral graphs. From a matrix theoretic point of
view, Seidel switching is a combined action of a number of unitary operations
on graphs. Recent works [1] and [2] have shown significant connections between
graph and quantum information theories. Corresponding to Laplacian matrices of
any graph there are quantum states useful in quantum computing. From this point
of view, graph theoretical problems are meaningful in the context of quantum
information. This work describes Seidel switching from a quantum perspective.
Here, we generalize Seidel switching to weighted directed graphs. We use it to
construct graphs with equal Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectra and
consider density matrices corresponding to them. Hence Seidel switching is a
technique to generate cospectral density matrices. Next, we show that all the
unitary operators used in Seidel switching are global unitary operators. Global
unitary operators can be used to generate entanglement, a benchmark phenomena
in quantum information processing.

amplify external shocks? This paper attempts to reconcile some apparently
different views emerged after the 2008 crisis regarding the nature and the
relevance of contagion in financial networks. We develop a common framework
encompassing several network contagion models and show that, regardless of the
shock distribution and the network topology, precise ordering relationships on
the level of aggregate systemic losses hold among models. We argue that the
extent of contagion crucially depends on the amount of information that each
model assumes to be available to market players. Under no uncertainty about the
network structure and values of external assets, the well-known Eisenberg and
Noe (2001) model applies, which delivers the lowest level of contagion. This is
due to a property of loss conservation: aggregate losses after contagion are
equal to the losses incurred by those institutions initially hit by a shock.
This property implies that many contagion analyses rule out by construction any
loss amplification, treating de facto an interconnected system as a single
aggregate entity, where losses are simply mutualised. Under higher levels of
uncertainty, as captured for instance by the DebtRank model, losses become
non-conservative and get compounded through the network. This has important
policy implications: by reducing the levels of uncertainty in times of distress
(e.g. by obtaining specific data on the network) policymakers would be able to
move towards more conservative scenarios. Empirically, we compare the magnitude
of contagion across models on a sample of the largest European banks during the
years 2006-2016. In particular, we analyse contagion effects as a function of
the size of the shock and the type of external assets shocked.

these tensions might have their common origin in New Physics (NP) beyond the SM
because some NP scenarios turn out to be preferred over the SM by
$4-5\,\sigma$. The fact that all these anomalies are related to muons further
suggests a connection (and a common NP explanation) with the long-standing
anomaly in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu$. In this article,
we study the impact of a generic class of NP models featuring new heavy scalars
and fermions that couple to the SM fermions via Yukawa-like interactions. We
consider two different scenarios, introducing either one additional fermion and
two scalars or two additional fermions and one scalar, and examine all possible
representations of the new particles under the SM gauge group with dimension up
to the adjoint one. The models induce one-loop contributions to $b\to
s\mu^+\mu^-$ and $a_\mu$ which are capable of solving the respective anomalies
at the $2\sigma$ level, albeit a relatively large coupling of the new particles
to muons is required. In the case of $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$, stringent constraints
from $B_s-\overline{B}_s$ mixing arise which can be relaxed if the new fermion

many dimensions, e.g., socio-demographics, language, genre, sentence type, etc.

answer to the question raised in the title. More concretely, we start with
Forman's notion of the Ricci curvature of a graph, or more generally, a
polyhedral complex. This will allow us to pass from a graph as representing a
network to a polyhedral complex for instance by filling in triangles into
connected triples of edges and to investigate the resulting effect on the
curvature. This is insightful for two reasons: First, we can define a curvature
flow in order to asymptotically simplify a network and reduce it to its
essentials. Second, using a construction of Bloch, which yields a discrete
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we have the Euler characteristic of a network as a global
characteristic. These two aspects beautifully merge in the sense that the
asymptotic properties of the curvature flow are indicated by that Euler
characteristic.

serious issues that appear in the joint estimation of its numerous parameters.
While the univariate fractional Brownian motion requires the estimation of two
parameters only, its mere bivariate extension already involves 7 parameters

for the full identification of bivariate OfBm (i.e., the joint estimation of
all parameters) through an original formulation as a non-linear wavelet
regression coupled with a custom-made Branch & Bound numerical scheme. The
estimation performance (consistency and asymptotic normality) is mathematically
established and numerically assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The

the associated computational costs are also thoroughly investigated.

Therefore the ATLAS experiment has constructed the first 4-layer Pixel Detector
in HEP, installing a new pixel layer, also called Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The
IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 at
a radius of 3.3 cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius
beam-pipe. The new detector, built to cope with the high radiation and expected
occupancy, is the first large scale application of 3D sensors and CMOS 130~nm
readout electronics. In addition, the Pixel Detector was improved with a new
service quarter panel to recover about 3\% of defective modules lost during
Run-1 and a new optical readout system to readout the data at higher speed
while reducing the occupancy when running with increased luminosity.
  Complementing detector improvements, many improvements to Inner Detector
track and vertex reconstruction were developed during the two-year shutdown of
the LHC. These include novel techniques developed to improve the performance in
the dense cores of jets, optimisation for the expected conditions, and a
software campaign which lead to a factor of three decrease in the CPU time

decentralized opportunistic short-range communication. For D2D to be useful,
mobile nodes must possess content that other mobiles want. Thus, intelligent
caching techniques are essential for D2D. In this paper we use results from
stochastic geometry to derive the probability of successful content delivery in
the presence of interference and noise. We employ a general transmission
strategy where multiple files are cached at the users and different files can
be transmitted simultaneously throughout the network. We then formulate an
optimization problem, and find the caching distribution that maximizes the
density of successful receptions (DSR) under a simple transmission strategy
where a single file is transmitted at a time throughout the network. We model
file requests by a Zipf distribution with exponent $\gamma_r$, which results in
an optimal caching distribution that is also a Zipf distribution with exponent
$\gamma_c$, which is related to $\gamma_r$ through a simple expression
involving the path loss exponent. We solve the optimal content placement
problem for more general demand profiles under Rayleigh, Ricean and Nakagami
small-scale fading distributions. Our results suggest that it is required to
flatten the request distribution to optimize the caching performance. We also
develop strategies to optimize content caching for the more general case with
multiple files, and bound the DSR for that scenario.

the expansion to the valence-subspace projected Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. The key
ideas used in our approach are: (i) employ Chebyshev filtering to compute a
subspace containing the occupied states followed by a localization procedure to
generate non-orthogonal localized functions spanning the Chebyshev-filtered
subspace; (ii) compute the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian projected onto the
valence-subspace; (iii) employ Fermi-operator expansion in terms of the
valence-subspace projected Hamiltonian to compute the density matrix,
electron-density and band energy. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance
of the method on benchmark materials systems involving silicon nano-clusters up
to 1330 electrons, a single gold atom and a six-atom gold nano-cluster. The
benchmark studies on silicon nano-clusters revealed a staggering five-fold
reduction in the Fermi-operator expansion polynomial degree by using the
spectrum-splitting approach for accuracies in the ground-state energies of
$\sim 10^{-4} Ha/atom$ with respect to reference calculations. Further,
numerical investigations on gold suggest that spectrum splitting is
indispensable to achieve meaningful accuracies, while employing Fermi-operator
expansion.

metamaterials suffer from large ohmic losses. New plasmonic materials, such as
doped oxides and nitrides, have smaller material loss, and, using them in place
of metals carries promise of reduced-loss plasmonic and metamaterial
structures, with sharper resonances and higher field concentration. This
promise is put to a rigorous analytical test in this work which reveals that
having low material loss is not sufficient to have a reduced modal loss in
plasmonic structures. To reduce the modal loss it is absolutely necessary for
the plasma frequency to be significantly higher than the operational frequency.
Using examples of nanoparticle plasmons and gap plasmons one comes to the
conclusion that even in the mid-infrared spectrum metals continue to hold
advantage over the alternative media. The new materials may still find
application niche where the high absorption loss is beneficial, e.g. in
medicine and thermal photovoltaics.

electron system is studied for strong topological insulators in the case of the
Fermi level being located at the Dirac point. The average conductivity
$\langle\sigma\rangle$ is numerically calculated for a system of length $L$ and
width $W$ under the periodic or antiperiodic boundary condition in the
transverse direction, and its behavior is analyzed by applying a finite-size
scaling approach. It is shown that $\langle\sigma\rangle$ is minimized at the
clean limit, where it becomes scale-invariant and depends only on $L/W$ and the
boundary condition. It is also shown that once disorder is introduced,
$\langle\sigma\rangle$ monotonically increases with increasing $L$. Hence, the
system becomes a perfect metal in the limit of $L \to \infty$ except at the
clean limit, which should be identified as an unstable fixed point. Although
the scaling curve of $\langle\sigma\rangle$ strongly depends on $L/W$ and the
boundary condition near the unstable fixed point, it becomes almost independent
of them with increasing $\langle\sigma\rangle$, implying that it asymptotically
obeys a universal law.

sample spaces. FES proceeds through scanning over the sample space using
windows in the form of $2\times 2$ tables of various sizes, and on each window
completing a Fisher's exact test. Based on a factorization of Fisher's
multivariate hypergeometric (MHG) likelihood into the product of the univariate
hypergeometric likelihoods, we show that there exists a coarse-to-fine,
sequential generative representation for the MHG model in the form of a
Bayesian network, which in turn implies the mutual independence (up to
deviation due to discreteness) among the Fisher's exact tests completed under
FES. This allows an exact characterization of the joint null distribution of
the $p$-values and gives rise to an effective inference recipe through simple
multiple testing procedures such as \v{S}id\'{a}k and Bonferroni corrections,
eliminating the need for resampling. In addition, FES can characterize
dependency through reporting significant windows after multiple testing
control. The computational complexity of FES is approximately linear in the
sample size, which along with the avoidance of resampling makes it ideal for
analyzing massive data sets. We use extensive numerical studies to illustrate
the work of FES and compare it to several state-of-the-art methods for testing
dependency in both statistical and computational performance. Finally, we apply
FES to analyzing a microbiome data set and further investigate its relationship

algorithms for dynamic (possibly adversarial) systems. The proposed framework
generalizes the popular online convex optimization framework and extends it to
its natural limit allowing it to capture a notion of regret that is intuitive
for more general problems such as those encountered in game theory and
variational inequalities. The framework hinges on a special choice of a
system-wide loss function we have developed. Using this framework, we prove
that a simple update scheme provides a no-regret algorithm for monotone
systems. While previous results in game theory prove individual agents can
enjoy unilateral no-regret guarantees, our result proves monotonicity
sufficient for guaranteeing no-regret when considering the adjustments of
multiple agent strategies in parallel. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is
the first framework to provide a suitable notion of regret for variational
inequalities. Most importantly, our proposed framework ensures monotonicity a
sufficient condition for employing multiple online learners safely in parallel.

Kolmogorov approach is natural. Indeed, techniques from the theory of
(generalized) Dirichlet forms imply a stochastic representation of the Langevin
semigroup as the transition kernel of diffusion process which provides a
martingale solution to the Langevin equation. Hence an interesting connection

  Communications and Networking",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy efficient mobility management is an important problem in modern
wireless networks with heterogeneous cell sizes and increased nodes densities.
We show that optimization-based mobility protocols cannot achieve long-term
optimal energy consumption, particularly for ultra-dense networks (UDN). To
address the complex dynamics of UDN, we propose a non-stochastic
online-learning approach which does not make any assumption on the statistical
behavior of the small base station (SBS) activities. In addition, we introduce
handover cost to the overall energy consumption, which forces the resulting
solution to explicitly minimize frequent handovers. The proposed Batched
Randomization with Exponential Weighting (BREW) algorithm relies on batching to
explore in bulk, and hence reduces unnecessary handovers. We prove that the
regret of BREW is sublinear in time, thus guaranteeing its convergence to the
optimal SBS selection. We further study the robustness of the BREW algorithm to
delayed or missing feedback. Moreover, we study the setting where SBSs can be
dynamically turned on and off. We prove that sublinear regret is impossible
with respect to arbitrary SBS on/off, and then develop a novel learning
strategy, called ranking expert (RE), that simultaneously takes into account
the handover cost and the availability of SBS. To address the high complexity
of RE, we propose a contextual ranking expert (CRE) algorithm that only assigns
experts in a given context. Rigorous regret bounds are proved for both RE and
CRE with respect to the best expert. Simulations show that not only do the
proposed mobility algorithms greatly reduce the system energy consumption, but
they are also robust to various dynamics which are common in practical
ultra-dense wireless networks.

diffusion can fail on a network in which people are only active in ""bursts"",
active for a while and then silent for a while, but diffusion could succeed on
the same network if people were active in a more random Poisson manner. Those
studies generally consider models in which nodes are active according to the
same random timing process and then ask which timing is optimal. In reality,
people differ widely in their activity patterns -- some are bursty and others
are not. Here we show that, if people differ in their activity patterns, bursty
behavior does not always hurt the diffusion, and in fact having some (but not
all) of the population be bursty significantly helps diffusion. We prove that
maximizing diffusion requires heterogeneous activity patterns across agents,

indicated by both a lower frequency with respect to control samples, and by a
systematically lower Balmer emission line equivalent width and luminosity (up

the probability density functions of stochastic thermodynamic quantities and

conventional procedure for obtaining these functions is to resort to a
first-principles approach; namely, the evolution equations of the CFs of the
combined system and its environment are obtained and then projected into the
degrees of freedom of the system. However, the QMEs can be unraveled by a
quantum jump trajectory. Thermodynamic quantities such as the heat, work, and
entropy production can be well defined along a trajectory. Hence, on the basis
of the notion of a trajectory, can we straightforwardly derive these CFs, e.g.,
their evolution equations? This is essential to establish the self-contained
stochastic thermodynamics of a QME. In this paper, we show that it is indeed
plausible and also simple. Particularly, these equations are fully consistent

flow is parallel to the axis of the cylinder at inlet. The pressure gradient is
zero in the streamwise direction. The base flow velocity profile is fully
non-parallel and non-similar in nature. The boundary layer grows continuously
in the spatial directions. Linearized Navier-Stokes(LNS) equations are derived
for the disturbance flow quantities in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The
LNS equations along with homogeneous boundary conditions forms a generalized
eigenvalues problem. Since the base flow is axisymmetric, the disturbances are
periodic in azimuthal direction. Chebyshev spectral collocation method and
Arnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the solution of the general
eigenvalues problem. The global temporal modes are computed for the range of
Reynolds numbers and different azimuthal wave numbers. The largest imaginary
part of the computed eigenmodes are negative and hence the flow is temporally
stable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes shows that the flow is
convectively unstable because the disturbance amplitudes grow in size and
magnitude when moving towards downstream. The global modes of axisymmetric
boundary layer are more stable than that of 2D flat plate boundary layer at low
Reynolds number. However, at high Reynolds number they approaches to 2D flat
plate boundary layer. Thus, the damping effect of transverse curvature is
significant at low Reynolds number. The wave-like nature of the disturbances is
found for most unstable eigenmodes.

three-dimensional co-clustering of the source vertices, the destination

any hyper-parameter tuning. The three dimensions are simultaneously segmented
in order to build clusters of source vertices, destination vertices and time
segments where the edge distributions across clusters of vertices follow the
same evolution over the time segments. The main novelty of this approach lies
in that the time segments are directly inferred from the evolution of the edge
distribution between the vertices, thus not requiring the user to make any a
priori quantization. Experiments conducted on artificial data illustrate the
good behavior of the technique, and a study of a real-life data set shows the
potential of the proposed approach for exploratory data analysis.

acceleration of individual aggregates through a two-hour image series.
Approximately 50% of the aggregates are accelerated away from the nucleus, and
50% towards it, and likewise towards either horizontal direction. The
accelerations are up to one order of magnitude stronger than local gravity, and
are most simply explained by the combined effect of gas drag accelerating all
aggregates upwards, and the recoil force from asymmetric outgassing, either
from rotating aggregates with randomly oriented spin axes and sufficient
thermal inertia to shift the temperature maximum away from an aggregate's
subsolar region, or from aggregates with variable ice content. At least 10% of
the aggregates will escape the gravity field of the nucleus and feed the
comet's debris trail, while others may fall back to the surface and contribute
to the deposits covering parts of the northern hemisphere. The rocket force
plays a crucial role in pushing these aggregates back towards the surface. Our
observations show the future back fall material in the process of ejection, and
provide the first direct measurement of the acceleration of aggregates in the
innermost coma (<2km) of a comet, where gas drag is still significant.

feature selection approach enables us to reduce the computation burden and the
falling accuracy effect of dealing with huge number of features in typical
learning problems. There is a variety of techniques for feature selection in
supervised learning problems based on different selection metrics. In this
paper, we propose a novel unified framework for feature selection built on the
graphical models and information theoretic tools. The proposed approach
exploits the structure learning among features to select more relevant and less
redundant features to the predictive modeling problem according to a primary
novel likelihood based criterion. In line with the selection of the optimal
subset of features through the proposed method, it provides us the Bayesian
network classifier without the additional cost of model training on the
selected subset of features. The optimal properties of our method are
established through empirical studies and computational complexity analysis.
Furthermore the proposed approach is evaluated on a bunch of benchmark datasets
based on the well-known classification algorithms. Extensive experiments
confirm the significant improvement of the proposed approach compared to the
earlier works.

too small to explain the observed $K$ dependent splitting. Instead, this

Furthermore, we prove the occurence of a coupling between longitudinal and
transverse excitons in $\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ due to the $K$ dependent nonanalytic
exchange interaction.

provision of higher data rates and always-on connectivity, which are the main
motivators for designing the fifth generation (5G) systems. To achieve higher
system efficiency, massive antenna deployment with tight coordination is one
potential strategy for designing 5G systems, but has two types of associated
system overhead. First is the synchronization overhead, which can be reduced by
implementing a cloud radio access network (CRAN)-based architecture design,
that separates the baseband processing and radio access functionality to
achieve better system synchronization. Second is the overhead for acquiring
channel state information (CSI) of the users present in the system, which,
however, increases tremendously when instantaneous CSI is used to serve
high-mobility users. To serve a large number of users, a CRAN system with a
dense deployment of remote radio heads (RRHs) is considered, such that each
user has a line-of-sight (LOS) link with the corresponding RRH. Since, the
trajectory of movement for high-mobility users is predictable; therefore,
fairly accurate position estimates for those users can be obtained, and can be
used for resource allocation to serve the considered users. The resource
allocation is dependent upon various correlated system parameters, and these
correlations can be learned using well-known \emph{machine learning}
algorithms. This paper proposes a novel \emph{learning-based resource
allocation scheme} for time division duplex (TDD) based 5G CRAN systems with
dense RRH deployment, by using only the users' position estimates for resource
allocation, thus avoiding the need for CSI acquisition. This reduces the
overall system overhead significantly, while still achieving near-optimal
system performance; thus, better (effective) system efficiency is achieved.

information science, since they both are considered as fundamental reasons for
significant features of quantum mechanics different from classical mechanics.
We present a group of complementary relations for quantum coherence and quantum
correlations; specifically, we focus on thermal discord and conditional
information in scenarios of multiple measurements. We show that the summation
of quantum coherence quantified in different bases has a lower bound, resulting
from entropic uncertainty relations with multiple measurements. Similar results
are also obtained for thermal discord and for post-measurement conditional
information with multiple measurements in a multipartite system. These results
indicate the general applications of the uncertainty principle to various
concepts of quantum information.

consider a scenario whereby asynchronous D2D communication underlays an OFDMA
macro-cell in the uplink. Motivated by the superior performance of new
waveforms with increased spectral localization in the presence of frequency and
time misalignments, we compare the system-level performance of a set-up for
when D2D pairs use either OFDM or FBMC/OQAM. We first demonstrate that
inter-D2D interference, resulting from misaligned communications, plays a
significant role in clustered D2D topologies. We then demonstrate that the
resource allocation procedure can be simplified when D2D pairs use FBMC/OQAM,
since the high spectral localization of FBMC/OQAM results in negligible
inter-D2D interference. Specifically, we identify that FBMC/OQAM is best suited
to scenarios consisting of small, densely populated D2D clusters located near
the encompassing cell's edge.

described as the combined effect of individual spatial dispersal and growth. In
the case of aquatic ecosystems flow transport can also be extremely relevant as
an extra, advection induced, dispersal factor. There is a lack of reproducible
experimental studies on biological fronts of living organisms in controlled
streaming habitats. It is thus not clear if, and to which extent, the current
theoretical and experimental knowledge on advective-reactive-diffusive fronts
for chemical reactions can also apply to the expansion of biological
populations. We designed and assembled a dedicated microfluidic device to
control and quantify the expansion of populations of $E.coli$ bacteria under
both co-flowing and counter-flowing conditions, measuring the front speed at
varying intensity of the imposed flow. At variance with respect to the case of
autocatalytic reactions, we measure that almost irrespective of the
counter-flow velocity, the front speed remains finite at a constant positive
value. A simple model incorporating growth, dispersion and drift on finite-size
hard beads allows to explain this finding as due to a finite volume effect of
the bacteria. This indicates that models based on the

cosmological predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model and to infer more precisely
the better model describing the evolution of the Universe. Galaxy clusters have
been currently used to infer cosmological parameters, in particular the matter
density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$, the matter power spectrum normalization
$\sigma_8$ and the equation of state parameter $w_{\rm de}$ of the dark energy
fluid. In this work, using data on massive galaxy clusters ($M>8\times
10^{14}~h^{-1}~M_{\odot}$) in the redshift range $0.05\lesssim z\lesssim 0.83$
we put constraints on the parameter $\alpha$ introduced within the formalism of
the extended spherical collapse model to quantify deviations from sphericity
due to shear and rotation. Since at the moment there is no physical model
describing its functional shape, we assume it to be a logarithmic function of
the cluster mass. By holding $\sigma_8$ fixed and restricting our analysis to a
$\Lambda$CDM model, we find, at $1-\sigma$ confidence level, $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.284\pm0.0064$, $h=0.678\pm0.017$ and $\beta=0.0019^{+0.0008}_{-0.0015}$,
where $\beta$ represents the slope of the parameter $\alpha$. This results
translates into a $9\%$ decrement of the number of massive clusters with
respect to a standard $\Lambda$CDM mass function, but better data are required
to better constrain this quantity, since at the $2-\sigma$ and $3-\sigma$
confidence level we are only able to infer upper limits.

equation. The proposed method is particularly useful for conductors with an
elaborate time-dependence stemming, e.g., from pulses or combinations of slow
and fast parameter switching. As a test bench for the evaluation of the
numerical stability, we consider time-independent problems for which the
full-counting statistics can be computed by other means. As applications, we
study cumulants of higher order for two time-dependent transport problems of
recent interest, namely steady-state coherent transfer by adiabatic passage and
Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg-Majorana interference in an open double quantum dot.

simulating kinetic equations with a BGK-type collision model with multiple

of multiple separated eigenvalue clusters. Projective integration methods are
explicit integration schemes that first take a few small (inner) steps with a
simple, explicit method, after which the solution is extrapolated forward in
time over a large (outer) time step. These are very efficient schemes, provided
there are only two clusters of eigenvalues. Telescopic projective integration
methods generalize the idea of projective integration methods by constructing a
hierarchy of projective levels. Here, we show how telescopic projective
integration methods can be used to efficiently integrate kinetic equations with
multiple relaxation times. We show that the required number of projective
levels depends on the number of clusters, which in turn depends on the
stiffness of the BGK source term. The size of the outer level time step only
depends on the slowest time scale present in the model and is independent of
the stiffness of the problem. We discuss stability and illustrate the approach

obtained from high spatial resolution images of jets in sources with recurrent
accretion outbursts. Using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument, we observed the young
binary Z CMa that is composed of a Herbig Be star and a FUor object, both
driving a jet. We analyse the structure of the two jets in relation with
previous accretion events observed in this target. We obtained optical images
in the Halpha and OI 6300A lines at the unprecedented angular resolution of
~0.03 arcsec, on which we have performed both continuum subtraction and
deconvolution, thereby deriving results that are consistent with each other.
Our images reveal extended emission from both sources: a fairly compact and
poorly collimated emission SW of the Herbig component and an extended
collimated and precessing jet from the FUor component. The compact emission
from the Herbig star is compatible with a wide-angle wind and is possibly
connected to the recent outburst events shown by this component. The FUor jet
is traced down to 70 mas (80 AU) from the source and is highly collimated with
a width of 26-48 AU at distances 100-200 AU, which is similar to the width of
jets from T Tauri stars. This strongly suggests that the same
magneto-centrifugal jet-launching mechanism also operates in FUors. The
observed jet wiggle can be modelled as originating from an orbital motion with
a period of 4.2 yr around an unseen companion with mass between 0.48 and 1
Msun. The jet mass loss rate Mloss was derived from the OI luminosity and is in
the range 1E-8 and 1E-6 Msun/yr. This is the first direct Mloss measurement
from a jet in a FUor. If we assume previous Macc estimates obtained through
modelling of the accretion disk, the derived range of Mloss would imply a very
low mass-ejection efficiency (Mloss/Macc < 0.02), which is lower than that
typical of T Tauri stars.

heavy Higgs bosons around $\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1-1)$ GeV, and the extent of the
mass degeneracy determines the magnitude of the CP-violating phase. We
explicate this point by investigating the CP-violating two-Higgs-doublet model
and the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. The cancellation mechanism is
general when there are CP violation and mixing in the Higgs sector of new
physics models. The CP-violating phases in this scenario can be excluded or
detected by the projected $^{225}$Ra EDM experiments with precision reaching
$\sim10^{-28}\,e\cdot{\rm cm}$, as well as the future colliders.

more effectively from challenging target densities exhibiting multiple modes or
strong correlations. Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the
parameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when
measured in number of steps. However, acquiring local geometric information can
often increase computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling
from high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total
computational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of
manifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a geometric adaptive Monte Carlo
sampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with
computational cost to achieve a high effective sample size for a given
computational cost. The suggested sampler is a discrete-time stochastic process
in random environment. The random environment allows to switch between local
geometric and adaptive proposal kernels with the help of a schedule. An
exponential schedule is put forward that enables more frequent use of geometric

time in late stationary phases. The average complexity can be manually set

particular, as-projective-as-possible (APAP) warps have been proven effective

identifies misaligned regions, and inserts appropriate point correspondences to
increase the flexibility of the warp and improve alignment. Unlike other warp

eigenvalues are, generally, complex and provide not only the energies but also
the lifetimes of the states of the system. The states may couple via the common
environment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded. This
causes an {\it external mixing} (EM) of the states. Mathematically, EM is
related to the existence of singular (the so-called exceptional) points (EPs).
The eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator are biorthogonal, in contrast to
the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure
for the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity
of the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum
value. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate
under the influence of an EP. At the parameter value of maximum width
bifurcation, the phase rigidity approaches the value one, meaning that the two
eigenfunctions become orthogonal. However, the eigenfunctions are externally
mixed at this parameter value. The S-matrix and therewith the cross section do
contain, in the one-channel case, almost no information on the EM of the
states. The situation is completely different in the case with two (or more)
channels where the resonance structure is strongly influenced by the EM of the
states and interesting features of non-Hermitian quantum physics are revealed.
We provide numerical results for two and three nearby eigenstates of a
non-Hermitian Hamilton operator which are embedded in one common continuum and
influenced by two adjoining EPs. The results are discussed. They are of
interest for an experimental test of the non-Hermitian quantum physics as well

different algorithms to constrain the cosmological parameters. For the Hubble
constant $H_0$ and dark matter density parameter $\Omega_m$, we adopt the
Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We find that with about 500-600 GW events we
can constrain the Hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to
\textit{Planck} temperature data and \textit{Planck} lensing combined results,
while for the dark matter density, GWs alone seem not able to provide the
constraints as good as for the Hubble constant; the sensitivity of 1000 GW
events is a little lower than that of \textit{Planck} data. It should require
more than 1000 events to match the \textit{Planck} sensitivity. Yet, for
analyzing the more complex dynamical property of dark energy, i.e., the
equation of state $w$, we adopt a new powerful nonparametric method: the
Gaussian process. We can reconstruct $w$ directly from the observational
luminosity distance at every redshift. In the low redshift region, we find that
about 700 GW events can give the constraints of $w(z)$ comparable to the
constraints of a constant $w$ by \textit{Planck} data with type Ia supernovae.
Those results show that GWs as the standard sirens to probe the cosmological
parameters can provide an independent and complementary alternative to current

pair intra charge and spin fluctuations. We will try to obtain an answer on the
question: why ground state of YBCO is Fermi liquid oscillating and of Bi-2212
is insulating? We will also clarify the physics of the recently observed MIC
results of Lalibert\'e et al. [2] and explain the long-discussed transition of
the electric charge density from doping to doping+1 dependence at the critical
doping. We predict that at the upturns this density should have the temperature
dependence $n\sim T^3n_2$ for $T\rightarrow 0$, where $n_2$ is density for
dopings close to the critical value. We understood that the upturns before and
after the first critical doping have the same nature. We will find
understanding of all above mentioned phenomena within the PG pair physics.

  unified picture","25 pages, 12 figures accepted for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent observations have revealed that at least 8 globular clusters (GCs) in
the Galaxy show internal abundance spreads in [Fe/H]. We investigate the origin
of these `anomalous' GCs using numerical simulations of GCs in the dwarfs
orbiting around the Galaxy and chemical evolution model of dwarfs hosting the
GCs. The principal results are as follows. GCs formed in a host dwarf galaxy
with a total mass of ~ 10^10 M_sun can merge to form a single nuclear GC before
the host is completely destroyed by the Galaxy, if they are massive (> 3*10^5
M_sun) and if they are formed in the inner region (R<400 pc). The GC merger
remnants can capture field stars during its spiral-in to nuclear regions. If
two GCs are formed from star formation events separated by ~300 Myr in their
host dwarf, then the new GC formed from GC merging can have [Fe/H] spread of
0.2 dex and [Ba/Fe] spread of 0.3 dex. GCs formed from GC merging can show
variety of internal abundance spreads depending on the details of their hosts'
chemical evolution. We suggest that anomalous GCs were formed from GC merging
that occurred before the destruction of GC host dwarfs yet after
self-enrichment processes responsible for the observed anti-correlations
between chemical abundances of light elements. We also suggest that the
observed no/little dependence of [Eu/Fe] on [Fe/H] in the Galactic GC M22 is
evidence of massive dwarf galaxies hosting these anomalous GCs.

utility maximization in a cellular network with underlaying device-to-device
(D2D) communications. A major innovation is the consideration of partial
channel state information (CSI), i.e., the base station (BS) is assumed to be
able to acquire `partial' instantaneous CSI of the cellular and D2D links, as
well as, the interference links. In contrast to existing works, multiple D2D
links are allowed to share the same channel, and the quality of service (QoS)
requirements for both the cellular and D2D links are enforced. We first develop
an optimal channel assignment algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP),
which enjoys a much lower complexity compared to exhaustive search and will
serve as a performance benchmark. To further reduce complexity, we propose a
cluster-based sub-optimal channel assignment algorithm. New closed-form
expressions for the expected weighted sum-rate and the successful transmission
probabilities are also derived. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithms. Moreover, by comparing different partial CSI
scenarios, we observe that the CSI of the D2D communication links and the
interference links from the D2D transmitters to the BS significantly affects
the network performance, while the CSI of the interference links from the BS to
the D2D receivers only has a negligible impact.

various cosmological topics. Spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a
very limited number of objects but can be used for creating statistical models.
A broad variety of photometric catalogues provide uncertain low resolution
spectral information for galaxies and quasars that can be used to infer a
redshift. Many different techniques have been developed to produce those
redshift estimates with increasing precision. Instead of providing a point
estimate only, astronomers start to generate probabilistic density functions
(PDFs) which should provide a characterisation of the uncertainties of the
estimation. In this work we present two simple approaches on how to generate
those PDFs. We use the example of generating the photometric redshift PDFs of
quasars from SDSS(DR7) to validate our approaches and to compare them with
point estimates. We do not aim for presenting a new best performing method, but
we choose an intuitive approach that is based on well known machine learning
algorithms. Furthermore we introduce proper tools for evaluating the
performance of PDFs in the context of astronomy. The continuous ranked
probability score (CRPS) and the probability integral transform (PIT) are well
accepted in the weather forecasting community. Both tools reflect how well the
PDFs reproduce the real values of the analysed objects. As we show, nearly all
currently used measures in astronomy show severe weaknesses when used to
evaluate PDFs.

doping than for hole doping. However, once phase separation is suppressed by
including a finite V, the low-energy spectral weight around q=(0,0) is
substantially suppressed. Instead a sharp zero-sound mode is stabilized above
the particle-hole continuum. We discuss that the presence of a moderate value

obtained in terms of the optimal variational parameters. The dependence of
these quantities upon the exciton-cavity coupling strength reveals that strong
cavity coupling leads to an enhanced vibrational dressing of the cavity mode,

turn results in a lower polaron polariton resembling a single-mode dressed bare
lower polariton in the strong-coupling regime. Thermal effects on several

mas, known to consist of an FU Orionis star (SE component) and an embedded
Herbig Be star (NW component). Immediately when the late-2008 outburst of Z CMa
was announced to the community, we initiated a high angular resolution imaging
campaign with VLT/NaCo, Keck/NIRC2, VLT/SINFONI, and Keck/OSIRIS which aimed at
characterizing the outburst of both components of the system in the
near-infrared. We confirm that the NW star dominates the system flux in the
1.1-3.8 microns range and is responsible for the photometric outburst. We
extract the first medium-resolution (R=2000-4000) near-infrared (1.1-2.4
microns) spectra of the individual components during and after the outburst.
The SE component has a spectrum typical of FU Orionis objects. The NW component
spectrum is characteristic of embedded outbursting protostars and EX Or
objects. It displays numerous emission lines during the outburst whose
intensity correlates with the system activity. In particular, we find a
correlation between the Brackett gamma equivalent width and the system
brightness. The bluing of the continuum of the NW component along with the
absolute flux and color-variation of the system during the outburst suggests
that the outburst was caused by a complex interplay between a variation of the
extinction in the line of sight of the NW component on one hand, and the
emission of shocked regions close to the NW component on the other. We confirm
the recently reported wiggling of the SE component jet from [Fe II] line
emission. We find a point-like structure associated with a peak emission at
2.098 microns coincidental with the clump or arm seen in broadband polarization
differential imaging as well as additional diffuse emission along a PA=214

ordinary differential equations, the numerical integration using Lie series has
shown some advantages. In its original form (Hanslmeier 1984), it was limited
to the N-body problem where only gravitational interactions are taken into

of fact, previous studies had been made but only for objects moving under
gravitational attraction. If other perturbations are added, the Lie integrator
has to be re-built. In the present work we consider two cases involving
position and position-velocity dependent perturbations: relativistic
acceleration in the framework of General Relativity and a simplified force for
the Yarkovsky effect. A general iteration procedure is applied to derive the
Lie series to any order and precision. We then give an application to the

problem under spectrum supply uncertainty. To obtain enough spectrum resources
to meet its customer demands, the virtual operator can either sense for the
temporarily unused spectrum in a licensed band, or lease spectrum from a
spectrum owner. Sensing is usually cheaper than leasing, but the amount of
available spectrum obtained by sensing is uncertain due to the primary users'
activities in the licensed band. Previous studies on spectrum investment
problems mainly considered the expected profit maximization problem of a
risk-neutral operator based on the expected utility theory (EUT). In reality,
however, an operator's decision is influenced by not only the consideration of
expected profit maximization, but also the level of its risk preference. To
capture this tradeoff between these two considerations, we analyze the
operator's optimal decision problem using the prospect theory from behavioral
economics, which includes EUT as a special case. The sensing and leasing
optimal problem under prospect theory is non-convex and challenging to solve.
Nevertheless, by exploiting the unimodal structure of the problem, we are able
to compute the unique global optimal solution. We show that comparing to an EUT
operator, both the risk-averse and risk-seeking operator achieve a smaller
expected profit. On the other hand, a risk-averse operator can guarantee a
larger minimum possible profit, while a risk-seeking operator can achieve a
larger maximum possible profit. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the expected
profit and the minimum possible profit for a risk-averse operator is better
when the sensing cost increases, while the tradeoff between the expected profit
and the maximum possible profit for a risk-seeking operator is better when the
sensing cost decreases.

find that all asymmetry measures are frozen for a state under a covariant

simulation that simultaneously implements a Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particle
candidate and a modified gravitational interaction in the form of $f(R)$
gravity, and compare its results with the individual effects of these two
independent extensions of the standard $\Lambda $CDM scenario, and with the
reference cosmology itself. We consider a rather extreme value of the WDM
particle mass ($m_{\rm WDM}=0.4$ keV) and a single realisation of $f(R)$
gravity with $|\bar{f}_{R0}|=10^{-5}$, and we investigate the impact of these
models and of their combination on a wide range of cosmological observables
with the aim to identify possible observational degeneracies. In particular, we
focus on the large-scale matter distribution, as well as on the statistical and
structural properties of collapsed halos and cosmic voids. Differently from the
case of combining $f(R)$ gravity with massive neutrinos -- previously
investigated in Baldi et al. (2014) -- we find that most of the considered
observables do not show any significant degeneracy due to the fact that WDM and
$f(R)$ gravity are characterised by individual observational footprints with a
very different functional dependence on cosmic scales and halo masses. In
particular, this is the case for the nonlinear matter power spectrum in real
space, for the halo and sub-halo mass functions, for the halo density profiles
and for the concentration-mass relation. However, other observables -- like
e.g. the halo bias -- do show some level of degeneracy between the two models,
while a very strong degeneracy is observed for the nonlinear matter power
spectrum in redshift space, for the density profiles of small cosmic voids --
with radius below $\approx 5$ Mpc$/h$ -- and for the voids abundance as a
function of the void core density.

investigate dipole-like oscillations induced by shifting the origin of the

we have computed time-evolutions and their Fourier transforms of several local

Wasserstein distances, rather than cross-variance measures which have been
usually considered, notably in LDA. Thanks to the the underlying principles of
optimal transport, WDA is able to capture both global (at distribution scale)

is a combination of a computationally efficient implementation of a
parallel-in-space-time finite element solver coupled with a posteriori
space-time error estimates and a parallel mesh generator. This methodology
enables, in principle, simultaneous adaptivity in both space and time (within
the block) domains. We explore this basic concept in the context of a variety
of time-steppers including $\Theta$-schemes and Backward Differentiate
Formulas. We specifically illustrate this framework with applications involving
time dependent linear, quasi-linear and semi-linear diffusion equations. We
focus on investigating how the coupled space-time refinement indicators for
this class of problems affect spatial adaptivity. Finally, we show good scaling
behavior up to 150,000 processors on the Blue Waters machine. This is achieved
by careful usage of memory via block storage and non-zero formats along with
lumped communication for matrix assembly. This methodology enables scaling on
next generation multi-core machines by simultaneously solving for large number
of time-steps, and reduces computational overhead by refining spatial blocks
that can track localized features. This methodology also opens up the
possibility of efficiently incorporating adjoint equations for error estimators
and inverse design problems, since blocks of space-time are simultaneously
solved and stored in memory.

dipolar clusters in cuprates. They are created by many-body interactions
between the dopant ion outside and holes inside the CuO planes. Because of the
two-fold degeneracy holes in the CuO plane cluster into four-particles
resonance valence bond plaquettes bound with dopant ions. Such dipoles may
order into charge-density waves (CDW) or stripes or form a disordered state
depending on doping and temperature. The lowest energy of the ordered system
corresponds to a local anti-ferroelectric ordering. The mobility of individual
disordered dipoles is very low at low temperatures and they prefer first to
bind into dipole-dipole pairs. Electromagnetic radiation interacts strongly
with electric dipoles and when the sample is subjected to it the mobility
changes significantly. This leads to a fractal growth of dipolar clusters. The
existence of electric dipoles and CDW induce two phase transitions with
increasing temperature, melting of the ordered state and disappearance of the
dipolar state. Ferroelectricity at low doping is a natural consequence of such
dipole moments. We develop a theory based on two-level systems and

gravitational collapse of massive dense gaseous clumps, and the way these

ingredient in regulating fragmentation. Here we present ALMA observations at
~0.25'' resolution of the thermal dust continuum emission at ~278 GHz towards a
turbulent, dense, and massive clump, IRAS 16061-5048c1, in a very early
evolutionary stage. The ALMA image shows that the clump has fragmented into
many cores along a filamentary structure. We find that the number, the total
mass and the spatial distribution of the fragments are consistent with
fragmentation dominated by a strong magnetic field. Our observations support
the theoretical prediction that the magnetic field plays a dominant role in the
fragmentation process of massive turbulent clump.

grating consists of only a few grooves. In this situation, the phase between
the grooves of the grating and its envelope is a decisive parameter for
nonlinear effects. Here, models are established for reproducing the
groove-envelope phase effects that have been observed in the interference
pattern of self-diffraction. Four-wave mixing leads to interferences that are
dominant in the spatial region between the orders of diffraction and with
tilted interference fringes in the diagram of transverse coordinate vs. pulse
delay. The vertical interference fringes that are dominant directly on the
diffraction orders, experimentally observed at high intensity close to the
damage threshold, require a model beyond four-wave mixing. A model is suggested
that is based on optical transmission changes with confinement to regions in
the medium that are smaller than the groove spacing.

glitches in pulsars, and losses in superconducting microwave circuits, and it
limits the current carrying capacity of superconductors. Understanding vortex
dynamics is therefore of fundamental and technological importance, and the
competition between the effects of thermal energy and energy barriers defined
by material disorder is not completely understood. In particular, early
measurements of thermally-activated vortex motion (creep) in iron-based
superconductors unveiled fast rates (S) comparable to measurements of YBa2Cu3O7

with the Ginzburg number (Gi), and Gi is orders of magnitude lower in most

BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2 films, and propose that there is a universal minimum
realizable (where Tc is the superconducting transition temperature) that has
been achieved in our films, few other materials, and violated by none. This
limitation provides new clues on how to design materials with slow creep and
helps elucidate open questions regarding the interplay between system-specific

varies across the instrument field of view (FOV). Local measurements of the
PSFs are given by the isolated stars images. Yet, these estimates may not be
directly usable for post-processings because of the observational noise and
potentially the aliasing. Aims: given a set of aliased and noisy stars images
from a telescope, we want to estimate well-resolved and noise-free PSFs at the
observed stars positions, in particular, exploiting the spatial correlation of
the PSFs across the FOV. Contributions: we introduce RCA (Resolved Components
Analysis) which is a noise-robust dimension reduction and super-resolution
method based on matrix factorization. We propose an original way of using the
PSFs spatial correlation in the restoration process through sparsity. The
introduced formalism can be applied to correlated data sets with respect to any
euclidean parametric space. Results: we tested our method on simulated
monochromatic PSFs of Euclid telescope (launch planned for 2020). The proposed
method outperforms existing PSFs restoration and dimension reduction methods.
We show that a coupled sparsity constraint on individual PSFs and their spatial
distribution yields a significant improvement on both the restored PSFs shapes
and the PSFs subspace identification, in presence of aliasing. Perspectives:
RCA can be naturally extended to account for the wavelength dependency of the
PSFs.

diagonalizations, we show that the phase boundaries between the Haldane phase,
the next-nearest neighbor Haldane phase and the dimerized phase can be very
accurately determined by combining the information deduced from the
dimerization, the ground-state energy, the entanglement spectrum and the Berry
phase. By a careful investigation of the finite-size spectrum, we also show
that the transition between the next-nearest neighbor Haldane phase and the
dimerized phase is in the Ising universality class all along the critical line.
Furthermore, we justify the conformal embedding of the $SU(2)_2$
Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory in terms of a boson and an Ising
field, and we explicitly derive a number of consequences of this embedding for
the spectrum along the $SU(2)_2$ transition line between the Haldane phase and
the dimerized phase. We also show that the solitons along the first-order
transition line between the Haldane phase and the dimerized phase carry a
spin-1/2, while those between different dimerization domains inside the
dimerized phase carry a spin 1. Finally, we show that short-range correlations

$\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \mu^+ \mu^-$, where the $\Lambda$ is the lightest
strange baryon. A further interesting channel is $\Lambda_b \to p^+ K^- \mu^+
\mu^-$, where the $p^+ K^-$ final state receives contributions from multiple
higher-mass $\Lambda$ resonances. The narrowest and most prominent of these is
the $\Lambda(1520)$, which has $J^P=\frac32^-$. Here we present an ongoing

utilized in practical applications. A possibility of modifying acoustic phonon
spectrum in individual nanostructures via spatial confinement would bring
tremendous benefits for controlling phonon-electron interaction and thermal

importance, conclusive experimental evidence of acoustic phonon confinement in
individual free-standing nanostructures, e.g. nanowires, is still missing. The
length scale, at which phonon dispersion undergoes changes and a possibility of
the phonon group velocity reduction, are debated. Here, we utilize specially
designed high-quality GaAs nanowires (NWs) with different diameters, D, and
large inter-nanowire distances to directly demonstrate acoustic phonon
confinement. The measurements conducted with Brillouin - Mandelstam
spectroscopy reveal confined phonon polarization branches with frequencies from
4 GHz to 40 GHz in NWs with D as large as ~128 nm, i.e. at length scale, which
exceeds the ""grey"" phonon mean-free path in GaAs by an almost an order of

in individual nanowires are in excellent agreement with theory. The obtained
results can lead to more efficient nanoscale control of acoustic phonons, with

  We derive formulas, which allow us to compute high-order accurate point
values of the conserved quantities at grid cell interfaces. Using those point
values, we can compute a high-order flux at the center of a grid cell
interface. Finally, we use those point values to compute high-order accurate

  The method is described in detail for the two-dimensional Euler equations of
gas dynamics. An extension to the three-dimensional case as well as to other
nonlinear systems of conservation laws in divergence form is straightforward.
Furthermore, similar ideas can be used to improve the accuracy of WENO type
methods for hyperbolic systems which are not in divergence form.

subjected to a large radiation background. Meanwhile high speed optical links
are required for the data transmission between the on-detector and off-detector
electronics. The GBT architecture and the Versatile Link (VL) project are
designed by CERN to support the 4.8 Gbps line rate bidirectional high-speed
data transmission which is called GBT link. In the ATLAS upgrade, besides the
link with on-detector, the GBT link is also used between different off-detector
systems. The GBTX ASIC is designed for the on-detector front-end,
correspondingly for the off-detector electronics, the GBT architecture is
implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). CERN launches the
GBT-FPGA project to provide examples in different types of FPGA. In the ATLAS
upgrade framework, the Front-End LInk eXchange (FELIX) system is used to
interface the front-end electronics of several ATLAS subsystems. The GBT link
is used between them, to transfer the detector data and the timing, trigger,
control and monitoring information. The trigger signal distributed in the
down-link from FELIX to the front-end requires a fixed and low latency. In this
paper, several optimizations on the GBT-FPGA IP core are introduced, to achieve
a lower fixed latency. For FELIX, a common firmware will be used to interface
different front-ends with support of both GBT modes: the forward error
correction mode and the wide mode. The modified GBT-FPGA core has the ability
to switch between the GBT modes without FPGA reprogramming. The system clock
distribution of the multi-channel FELIX firmware is also discussed in this
paper.

reduced gauge invariance. It allows to couple the electromagnetic field to a
charge which is not locally conserved, and has an additional degree of freedom,
the scalar field $S=\partial_\alpha A^\alpha$, usually interpreted as a
longitudinal wave component. By re-formulating the theory in a compact
Lagrangian formalism, we are able to eliminate $S$ explicitly from the dynamics
and we obtain generalized Maxwell equation with interesting properties: they
give $\partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu}$ as the (conserved) sum of the (possibly
non-conserved) physical current density $j^\nu$, and a ""secondary"" current
density $i^\nu$ which is a non-local function of $j^\nu$. This implies that any
non-conservation of $j^\nu$ is effectively ""censored"" by the observable field
$F^{\mu \nu}$, and yet it may have real physical consequences. We give examples
of stationary solutions which display these properties. Possible applications
are to systems where local charge conservation is violated due to anomalies of
the ABJ kind or to macroscopic quantum tunnelling with currents which do not
satisfy a local continuity equation.

applications. We study the capture process on complex networks by considering
multiple predators from multiple sources. In our model, some lions start from
multiple sources simultaneously to capture the lamb by biased random walks,
which are controlled with a free parameter $\alpha$. We derive the distribution
of the lamb's lifetime and the expected lifetime $\left\langle T\right\rangle
$. Through simulation, we find that the expected lifetime drops substantially
with the increasing number of lions. We also study how the underlying
topological structure affects the capture process, and obtain that locating on
small-degree nodes is better than large-degree nodes to prolong the lifetime of
the lamb. Moreover, dense or homogeneous network structures are against the
survival of the lamb.

Doppler theory. It may also work well for classical theory. As conservation of
momentum and energy are physical laws, if applying these laws gives the exact
relativistic Doppler effect, it should also give the exact classical Doppler
effect. So far the classical Doppler effect is only obtained by using some
approximation, as derived by Fermi in 1932. We show that the exact classical
Doppler effect can be derived from the photon emission process in the exact
treatment and reveal that these results are the same as those derived from the
wave theory of light.

provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods--e.g. tracking
ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury
goods--has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and
transported in complex, inter-organizational, often internationally-spanning
supply chains. Recent adoption of Internet of Things and Blockchain
technologies give promise at better supply chain provenance. We are
particularly interested in the blockchain as many favoured use cases of
blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying
ontologies as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance,
traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a
case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this
case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its
representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce
traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.

of Things (IoT) is a compelling platform connecting various sensors around us
to the Internet, providing great opportunities for the realization of smart
living. Spintronic sensors with superb measuring ability and multiple unique
advantages can be an important piece of cornerstone for IoT. In this review, we
discuss successful applications of spintronic sensors in electrical current
sensing, transmission and distribution lines monitoring, vehicle detection, and
biodetection. Traditional monitoring systems with limited sensors and wired
communication can merely collect fragmented data in the application domains. In
this paper, the wireless spintronic sensor networks (WSSNs) will be proposed
and illustrated to provide pervasive monitoring systems, which facilitate the
intelligent surveillance and management over building, power grid, transport,

the policy making in public services and city planning. This work provides
insights for realizing smart living through the integration of IoT with
