real algebraic geometry and the subject of active research. The sum-of-squares
representations of a given polynomial are parametrized by the convex body of
positive semidefinite Gram matrices, called the Gram spectrahedron. This is a
fundamental object in polynomial optimization and convex algebraic geometry. We
summarize results on sums of squares that fit naturally into the context of
Gram spectrahedra, present some new results, and highlight related open

relate them to Hermitian Gram spectrahedra and point evaluations on toric

(HQCPs) of height $\frac{e^2}{2h}$ have been observed in quantum anomalous Hall

predicted that these HQCPs are signatures of chiral Majorana edge states. The
HQCPs are supposed to appear in the regimes where the Hall conductance
$\sigma_{xy}$ is quantized. However, experimentally, a pair of the HQCPs appear
when the Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}$ is only 80% of the quantized value when
dissipative channels appear in the bulk. The dissipative channels in the bulk
are expected to induce Andreev reflections and ruin the HQCPs. In this work, we
explain how domain walls can cause $\sigma_{xy}$ to deviate from its quantized

supports the claim that the experimentally observed HQCPs are indeed caused by
chiral Majorana modes in the QAH insulator/superconductor heterostructure.

accurate system model of the adaptive streaming system, LTE-A, and the
stochastic availability of unlicensed resources. Then, the formulated problem
is solved in two stages: First, we calculate a proportionally fair video

analysed from the standpoint of its thermodynamical stability criteria with the

constant, $n$ is a constant parameter and $V$ is the volume of the cosmic
fluid. We get the interesting result that if the well-known stability
conditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of $n$ are constrained to be
negative definite to make $ \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{S} <0$
\& $ \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{T} <0$ throughout the
evolution. Moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume
$c_{V}$ as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured in
this case. For the particular case $n = 0$ the effective equation of state
reduces to $\Lambda$CDM model in the late stage of the universe while for $n
<0$ it mimics a phantom-like cosmology which is in broad agreement with the
present SNe Ia constraints like VGCG model. The thermal equation of state is
discussed and the EoS parameter is found to be an explicit function of
temperature only. Further for large volume the thermal equation of state
parameter is identical with the caloric equation of state parameter when $ T
\rightarrow 0$. It may also be mentioned that like Santos et al our model does
not admit of any critical points. We also observe that although the earlier
model of Lu explains many of the current observational findings of different
probes it fails to explain the crucial tests of thermodynamical stability.

the total gap $\tilde\Delta$ in the bare susceptibility is determined by the

For the Fermi surface geometry characteristic to the most of iron pnictides and

The post-starburst galaxies appear in both the optical green valley and the
WISE Infrared Transition Zone (IRTZ). Furthermore, we find that post-starbursts
occupy a distinct region [3.4]-[4.6] vs. [4.6]-[12] WISE colors, enabling the
identification of this class of transitioning galaxies through the use of
broad-band photometric criteria alone. We have investigated possible causes for
the WISE colors of post-starbursts by constructing a composite spectral energy
distribution (SED), finding that mid-infrared (4-12{\mu}m) properties of
post-starbursts are consistent with either 11.3{\mu}m polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon emission, or Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB)
and post-AGB stars. The composite SED of extended post- starburst galaxies with
22{\mu}m emission detected with signal to noise >3 requires a hot dust
component to produce their observed rising mid-infrared SED between 12 and
22{\mu}m. The composite SED of WISE 22{\mu}m non-detections (S/N<3), created by
stacking 22{\mu}m images, is also flat, requiring a hot dust component. The
most likely source of this mid-infrared emission of these E+A galaxies is a
buried active galactic nucleus. The inferred upper limit to the Eddington
ratios of post-starbursts are 1e-2 to 1e-4, with an average of 1e-3. This
suggests that AGNs are not radiatively dominant in these systems. This could
mean that including selections able to identify active galactic nuclei as part
of a search for transitioning and post-starburst galaxies would create a more
complete census of the transition pathways taken as a galaxy quenches its star
formation.

well-known 22 GHz water megamaser galaxy, for water (mega)maser emission at 183
GHz. Method: We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to perform the observations. Results: We
detected 183 GHz water maser emission towards NGC 4945 with a peak flux density
of ~3 Jy near the galactic systemic velocity. The emission spans a velocity
range of several hundred km/s. We estimate an isotropic luminosity of > 1000
Lsun, classifying the emission as a megamaser. A comparison of the 183 GHz
spectrum with that observed at 22 GHz suggests that 183 GHz emission also
arises from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) central engine. If the 183 GHz
emission originates from the circumnuclear disk, then we estimate that a
redshifted feature at 1084 km/s in the spectrum should arise from a distance of
0.022 pc from the supermassive black hole (1.6 x 10(5) Schwarzschild radii),
i.e. closer than the water maser emission previously detected at 22 GHz. This
is only the second time 183 GHz maser emission has been detected towards an AGN
central engine (the other galaxy being NGC 3079). It is also the strongest
extragalactic millimetre/submillimetre water maser detected to date.
Conclusions: Strong millimetre 183 GHz water maser emission has now been shown
to occur in an external galaxy. For NGC 4945, we believe that the maser
emission arises, or is dominated by, emission from the AGN central engine.
Emission at higher velocity, i.e. for a Keplerian disk closer to the black
hole, has been detected at 183 GHz compared with that for the 22 GHz megamaser.
This indicates that millimetre/submillimetre water masers can indeed be useful
probes for tracing out more of AGN central engine structures and dynamics than
previously probed. Future observations using ALMA Band 5 should unequivocally
determine the origin of the emission in this and other galaxies.

whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined

from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural
task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution
classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with
computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is
typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational
complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential
time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime
using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42
qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational
task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are
extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the
near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross
entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the
circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured
when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable
regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical
estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.

define a probability function that governs the joint distribution of a random

arising from a completely random measure mixed Poisson process, allows the
probability distribution of the random partitions of a subset of a population
to be dependent on the population size, a distinct and motivated feature that
makes it more flexible than a partition structure. This allows it to model an
entire FoF distribution whose structural properties change as the population
size varies. A FoF vector can be simulated by drawing an infinite number of
Poisson random variables, or by a stick-breaking construction with a finite
random number of steps. A generalized negative binomial process model is
proposed to generate a cluster structure, where in the prior the number of
clusters is finite and Poisson distributed, and the cluster sizes follow a
truncated negative binomial distribution. We propose a simple Gibbs sampling
algorithm to extrapolate the FoF vector of a population given the FoF vector of
a sample taken without replacement from the population. We illustrate our
results and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed models through the

optimization problem with many applications, that has been studied extensively.
Until recently, the best approximation algorithm for it achieved an $O(\log
\log n)$-approximation factor. In a recent breakthrough, Adamaszek and Wiese
provided a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme: a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with running time
$n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(\log n)/\epsilon)}$. Despite this result, obtaining a
PTAS or even a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation remains a
challenging open problem. In this paper we make progress towards this goal by
providing an algorithm for MISR that achieves a $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation
in time $n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(\log\log{n} / \epsilon))}$. We introduce
several new technical ideas, that we hope will lead to further progress on this
and related problems.

our model, we observe that if in a recession the government imposes a demand
shock to stimulate the network, metastable features shape its response.
Actually we find that there is a minimum bound where demand shocks with a size
below it are unable to trigger the market out from recession. We then
investigate the impact of network characteristics on this minimum bound. We
surprisingly observe that in a Watts-Strogatz network though the minimum bound
depends on the average of the degrees, when translated into the economics
language, such a bound is independent of the average degrees. This bound is
about $0.44 \Delta$GDP, where $\Delta$GDP is the gap of GDP between recession
and expansion. We examine our suggestions for the cases of the United States
and the European Union in the recent recession, and compare them with the
imposed stimulations. While stimulation in the US has been above our threshold,
in the EU it has been far below our threshold. Beside providing a minimum bound
for a successful stimulation, our study on the metastable features suggests
that in the time of crisis there is a ""golden time passage"" in which the
minimum bound for successful stimulation can be much lower. So, our study
strongly suggests stimulations to be started within this time passage.

imagery has improved despeckling performance. To deduce the problem of
filtering the multiplicative noise to the case of an additive noise, the
wavelet decomposition is performed on the logarithm of the image gray levels.
The detail coefficients produced by the bidimensional discrete wavelet
transform (DWT-2D) needs to be thresholded to extract out the speckle in
highest subbands. An initial threshold value is estimated according to the
noise variance. In this paper, an additional fuzzy thresholding approach for
automatic determination of the rate threshold level around the traditional
wavelet noise thresholding (initial threshold) is applied, and used for the
soft or hard-threshold performed on all the high frequency subimages. The
filtered logarithmic image is then obtained by reconstruction from the
thresholded coefficients. This process is applied a single time, and
exclusively to the first level of decomposition. The exponential function of
this reconstructed image gives the final filtered image. Experimental results
on test images have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method compared to
the most of methods in use at the moment.

possibilities for weak-scale supersymmetry. In particular, two models, called

consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson, gauge coupling unification, and
thermal relic neutralino dark matter) without the need for fine-tuned relations
between particle masses. We determine the implications of these models for dark

heavy Bino dark matter with mass in the range 300-700 GeV, which is not usually
considered. Dark matter direct detection cross sections are typically below
current limits, but are naturally expected above the neutrino floor and may be
seen at next-generation experiments. Indirect detection prospects are bright at
the Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided the 4th-generation leptons have mass
above 350 GeV or decay to taus. In a completely complementary way, discovery
prospects at the LHC are dim if the 4th-generation leptons are heavy or decay

$M_{*}>$10$^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the scatter in this relation strongly
correlates with optical morphology (i.e., visual classification and S\'ersic
index). These findings confirm that massive galaxies of all types lie on a
plane relating mass, angular momentum and stellar light distribution, and
suggest that the large-scale morphology of a galaxy is regulated by its mass
and dynamical state. We show that the significant scatter in the $M_{*}-j$
relation is accounted for by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, the
contribution of ordered motions to the dynamical support of galaxies varies by
at least a factor of three. Indeed, the stellar spin parameter (quantified via
$\lambda_R$) correlates strongly with S\'ersic and concentration indices. This
correlation is particularly strong once slow-rotators are removed from the

continuous class of objects in terms of their kinematic properties.

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary goal in this thesis is to identify better syntactic constraint or
bias, that is language independent but also efficiently exploitable during
sentence processing. We focus on a particular syntactic construction called
center-embedding, which is well studied in psycholinguistics and noted to cause
particular difficulty for comprehension. Since people use language as a tool
for communication, one expects such complex constructions to be avoided for
communication efficiency. From a computational perspective, center-embedding is
closely relevant to a left-corner parsing algorithm, which can capture the
degree of center-embedding of a parse tree being constructed. This connection
suggests left-corner methods can be a tool to exploit the universal syntactic
constraint that people avoid generating center-embedded structures. We explore
such utilities of center-embedding as well as left-corner methods extensively
through several theoretical and empirical examinations.
  Our primary task is unsupervised grammar induction. In this task, the input
to the algorithm is a collection of sentences, from which the model tries to
extract the salient patterns on them as a grammar. This is a particularly hard
problem although we expect the universal constraint may help in improving the
performance since it can effectively restrict the possible search space for the
model. We build the model by extending the left-corner parsing algorithm for
efficiently tabulating the search space except those involving center-embedding
up to a specific degree. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on many
treebanks, and demonstrate that often our constraint leads to better parsing
performance. We thus conclude that left-corner methods are particularly useful
for syntax-oriented systems, as it can exploit efficiently the inherent
universal constraints in languages.

  authors; add a word to the title",,,,"math.RT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu by extracting
the similarities between exact categories and triangulated categories. A notion
of mutation of subcategories in an extriangulated category is defined in this
article. Let $\cal A$ be an extension closed subcategory of an extriangulated
category $\cal C$. Then the quotient category $\cal M:=\cal{A}/\cal{X}$ carries
naturally a triangulated structure whenever $(\cal A,\cal A)$ forms an $\cal
X$-mutation pair. This result unifies many previous constructions of
triangulated quotient categories, and using it gives a classification of thick
triangulated subcategories of pretriangulated category $\cal{C}/\cal{X}$, where
$\cal X$ is functorially finite in $\cal C$. When $\cal C$ has Auslander-Reiten
translation $\tau$, we prove that for a functorially finite subcategory $\cal
X$ of $\cal C$ containing projectives and injectives, $\cal{C}/\cal{X}$ is a
triangulated category if and only if $(\cal C,\cal C)$ is $\cal X-$mutation if
and only if $\tau \underline{\cal X}=\bar{\cal X}.$ This generalizes a result
by J{\o}rgensen who proved the equivalence between the first and the third
conditions for triangulated categories. Furthermore, we show that for such a
subcategory $\cal X$ of the extriangulated category $\cal C$, $\cal C$ admits a
new extriangulated structure such that $\cal C$ is a Frobenius extriangulated
category. Applications to exact categories and triangulated categories are
given. From the applications we present examples that extriangulated categories
are neither exact categories nor triangulated categories.

address this problem from the following two perspectives. First, conceptually,
we define specific properties to characterize the subgraphs of a PrAG with
respect to a given extension, such that the probability of a set of arguments E
being an extension can be defined in terms of these properties, without (or
with less) construction of subgraphs. Second, computationally, we take
preferred semantics as an example, and develop algorithms to evaluate the
efficiency of our approach. The results show that our approach not only
dramatically decreases the time for computing p(E^\sigma), but also has an
attractive property, which is contrary to that of existing approaches: the
denser the edges of a PrAG are or the bigger the size of a given extension E
is, the more efficient our approach computes p(E^\sigma). Meanwhile, it is
shown that under complete and preferred semantics, the problems of determining
p(E^\sigma) are fixed-parameter tractable.

for the description of gas dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann equation
is applied for the rarefied gas dynamics. Both equations are constructed from
modeling flow physics in different scales. Fortunately, due to the distinct
separation of scales, i.e., the hydrodynamic and kinetic ones, both
Navier-Stokes equations and the Boltzmann equation are valid in their
respectable domains. However, in real physical application, there may not have
such a distinctive scale separation. For example, around a hypersonic flying
vehicle, the flow physics at different regions may correspond to different
regimes, where the local Knudsen number can be changed in several order of
magnitudes. With a variation of modeling scale, theoretically a continuous
governing equation from kinetic Boltzmann equation to the hydrodynamic
Navier-Stokes equations should exist. However, due to the difficulties of a
direct modeling of flow physics in the scale between the kinetic and
hydrodynamic ones, there is basically no reliable theory or valid governing
equation to cover the whole transition regime. In fact, it is an unresolved
problem about the exact scale for the validity of the NS equations as Reynolds
number decreases. The traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based
on the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE), and it
targets on the recovering of the exact solution of the PDEs as mesh size and
time step converging to zero. This methodology can be hardly applied here
because there is no such a complete PDE for flow physics in all scales. It may
be the time to combine the modeling and computation together without going
through the process of constructing PDEs. In other words, the CFD research is
not only to obtain the numerical solution of governing equation, but also to
construct a valid discrete governing equation to identify the flow physics in
the mesh size and time step scales. In this paper, we are going to present the
idea for the modeling and computation. This methodology leads to the unified
gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for flow simulation in all flow regimes. Based on
UGKS, the boundary for the validation of the Navier-Stokes equations can be
quantitatively evaluated. The combination of modeling and computation provides
a paradigm for the description of multiscale transport process.

magnetic resonant coupling (MRC), multiple transmitters are deployed to enhance
the efficiency of power transfer to the electric load at a single receiver by
jointly optimizing their source currents/voltages to constructively combine the
induced magnetic fields at the receiver, known as magnetic beamforming. In
practice, since the transmitters (power chargers) are usually at fixed
locations and the receiver (e.g. mobile phone) is desired to be freely located
in a target region for wireless charging, its received power can fluctuate
significantly over locations even with adaptive magnetic beamforming applied.
To achieve uniform coverage, the transmitters need to be optimally placed in
the region, which motivates this paper. First, we derive the optimal magnetic
beamforming solution in closed-form for a distributed MISO WPT system with
given locations of the transmitters and receiver to maximize the deliverable
power to the receiver load subject to a given sum-power constraint at all
transmitters. With the optimal magnetic beamforming solution, we then jointly
optimize the locations of all transmitters to maximize the minimum power
deliverable to the receiver when it is being moved over a given one-dimensional
(1D) region, i.e., a line of finite length. Although the formulated node
placement problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm for solving
it efficiently. Extensive simulation results are provided which show the
significant performance gains by the proposed design with optimized transmitter
locations and magnetic beamforming as compared to other benchmark schemes with
non-adaptive or heuristic currents allocation and transmitters placement. Last,
we extend the node placement problem to the more general case of
two-dimensional (2D) region, and draw the key insights.

takes a different approach. We define a class of gradient-based online learning
algorithms we term Direct Online Optimization for Modeling Errors in Dynamics
(DOOMED) that directly minimize an objective measuring the divergence between
actual and desired accelerations. Our objective is defined in terms of the true
system's unknown dynamics and is therefore impossible to evaluate. However, we
show that its gradient is measurable online from system data. We develop a
novel adaptive control approach based on running online learning to directly
correct (inverse) dynamics errors in real time using the data stream from the
robot to accurately achieve desired accelerations during execution.

affects the electronic properties is crucial for the development of
applications such as flexible electronics, energy harvesting devices or

the structural-dependence of the localized electronic states in their vicinity.
Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy
(STS), together with tight binding and ab initio numerical simulations we
explore GBs on the surface of graphite and elucidate the interconnection
between the local density of states (LDOS) and their atomic structure. We show
that the electronic fingerprints of these GBs consist of pronounced resonances

appear either on the electron side of the spectrum or as an electron-hole
symmetric doublet close to the charge neutrality point. These two types of
spectral features will impact very differently the transport properties
allowing, in the asymmetric case to introduce transport anisotropy which could
be utilized to design novel growth and fabrication strategies to control device

a comparison of O-rich and carbonaceous dust-production rates. In the LMC, for
instance, the rate of dust production from carbon stars is about two and a half
times that from oxygen-rich AGBs. A reliable determination of the fractional

chemical evolution. However, the Spitzer IRAC photometric bands do not
sufficiently probe the characteristic mid-infrared spectral features that can
distinguish O-rich AGBs from carbon stars - namely, the 9.7 $\mu$m silicate

distinguish these two types of chemistries. In this contribution, synthetic

the R\'enyi entropy for four dimensional CFTs in terms of the parameters $(c,
t_2, t_4)$ of two-point and three-point functions of stress tensors. As a
consistency check, these shape coefficients $f_a$ and $f_c$ satisfy the
differential relation as derived previously for the R\'enyi entropy.
Interestingly, these holographic relations also apply to weakly coupled
conformal field theories such as theories of free fermions and vectors but are
violated by theories of free scalars. The mismatch of $f_a$ for scalars has
been observed in the literature and is due to certain delicate boundary
contributions to the modular Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we find a combination
of our holographic relations which are satisfied by all free CFTs including
scalars. We conjecture that this combined relation is universal for general
CFTs in four dimensional spacetime. Finally, we find there are similar

methods operate at a phrase-level and rely on part-of-speech (POS) filters for
candidate phrase generation. In addition, they do not directly handle
keyphrases of varying lengths. We overcome these modeling shortcomings by
addressing keyphrase extraction as a sequential labeling task in this paper. We
explore a basic set of features commonly used in NLP tasks as well as
predictions from various unsupervised methods to train our taggers. In addition
to a more natural modeling for the keyphrase extraction problem, we show that
tagging models yield significant performance benefits over existing
state-of-the-art extraction methods.

the most important tasks in astrophysics. It is directly related to the
identification of the black holes in the universe, the production of neutron
stars from the supernovae explosion, and the equation of state (EoS) of dense
matter. However, not only the EoS is directly connected with neutron star
masses, but also the speed of sound in dense matter is a crucial quantity which
characterizes the stiffness of the EoS. The upper bound of the speed of sound
imposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of neutron stars. However, this
upper bound remains still an open issue. Recent observations, of binary neutron
star systems, offer the possibility of measuring with high accuracy both the
mass and the tidal polarizability of the stars. We study possible effects of
the upper bound of the speed of sound on the upper bound of the mass and the

high-performance TE devices. In this paper, we investigate the TE transport
properties of the Bi2Se3 thin film by the first-principle calculations and the
Boltzmann transport theory. By comparing our calculations with the earlier
experimental data, we demonstrate that, for the Bi2Se3 film of thickness larger
than six quintuple layers, the relaxation time of the topological surface
states in the bulk gap is about hundreds of femtoseconds, which is about two
orders larger than that of the bulk states. Such a large relaxation-time
difference causes the ratio of the electrical conductance to the thermal
conductance much larger than the value predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, as
well as the large magnitude of Seebeck coefficient, and consequently the large
TE figure of merit, when the Fermi level is near the conduction band edge. We
shows that the TE performance can be further improved by introducing defects in
the middle layers of the thin film. The improvement is generally significant at
room temperature and can be further enhanced at higher temperature.

each time instance, the satellite samples the interference and forwards it to
the gateway to estimate its frequency. Since the satellite moves, each
estimated frequency includes a Doppler shift, which is related to the location
of the unknown interferer. The satellite's position, velocity, oscillator
frequency, and the interference frequency are used at the gateway to build a
location-related equation between the estimated frequency and the location of
the unknown interference. Simultaneously with the interference signal, the
satellite samples a reference signal to calibrate the estimated frequency and
compensate for the mismatches between the available and real values of the
satellite's position, velocity, and oscillator frequency. Multiple

high-harmonic sources are increasingly being used to image physical and
biological systems using emerging techniques such as coherent diffraction
imaging and ptychography. These novel imaging methods require coherent
illumination, and it is therefore important to both characterize the spatial
coherence of high-harmonic beams and understand the processes which limit this

high-harmonic radiation generated in a gas cell. The variation with harmonic
order of the intensity profile, wavefront curvature, and complex coherence
factor is measured in the far-field by the SCIMITAR technique. Using the
Gaussian-Schell model, the properties of the harmonic beam in the plane of

harmonic spatial coherence is consistent with partial coherence induced by both
variation of the intensity-dependent dipole phase as well as finite spatial
coherence of the driving radiation. These findings are used to suggest ways in
which the coherence of harmonic beams could be increased further, which would

was defined by Chazal, De Silva and Oudot, and they showed it was stable with
respect to the correspondence distortion distance. Allowing asymmetry, we
consider four different persistence modules. The first method is through
symmetrisation. For $a\in [0,1]$ we can construct a symmetric function
$sym_a(f)(x,y)=a \min \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}+ (1-a)\max \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}$. We can
then follow the apply the standard theory for symmetric functions and get
stability as a corollary. The second method is to construct a filtration of
ordered tuple complexes where tuple $(x_0, x_2, \ldots x_p)\in Rips^{dir}(X)_t$
if $d(x_i, x_j)\leq t$ for all $i\leq j$. These two methods have the same
persistent homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric
space, or more generally to a symmetric function. We consider two constructions
using a filtration of directed graphs. We have directed graphs $\{D(X)_t\}$,
where directed edges $x\to y$ are included in $D(X)_t$ whenever
$\max\{f(x,y),f(x,x),f(y,y)\}\leq t$. From this we construct a preorder where
$x\leq y$ if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D(X)_t$. We build persistence
modules using the strongly connected components of the graphs $D(X)_t$, which
are the equivalence classes of the associated preorders. We consider
persistence modules using a generalisation of poset topology to preorders. The
Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be extended as a correspondence distortion
distance to set-function pairs. We prove that all these new constructions enjoy
the same stability results.

consequence of parity violation, such a CMB trispectrum has nonvanishing signal
in the $\ell_1 + \ell_2 + \ell_3 + \ell_4 = \text{odd}$ domain, which is
prohibited in the concordance cosmology. When the curvature trispectrum is
parametrized with Legendre polynomials, the CMB signal due to the Legendre
dipolar term is enhanced at the squeezed configurations in $\ell$ space,
yielding a high signal-to-noise ratio. A Fisher matrix computation results in a
minimum detectable size of the dipolar coefficient in a
cosmic-variance-limited-level temperature survey as $d_1^{\rm odd} = 640$. In
an inflationary model where the inflaton field couples to the gauge field via
an $f(\phi)(F^2 + F\tilde{F})$ interaction, the curvature trispectrum contains
such a parity-odd dipolar term. We find that, in this model, the CMB
trispectrum yields a high signal-to-noise ratio compared with the CMB power

redshift of $z\sim 1.04 (\pm 0.58)$. Using a four parameter HOD model we derive
the host mass scales of WISE selected quasars. Our results show that the median
halo masses of central and satellite quasars lie in the range $M_{\mathrm{cen}}
= (5 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\mathrm{sat}} = 8 (^{+7.8}
_{-4.8}) \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, respectively. The derived satellite
fraction is $f_{\mathrm{sat}}= 5.5 (^{+35} _{-5.0})\times 10^{-3}$. Previously
Richardson et al.\ used the SDSS DR7 quasar clustering data to obtain the halo
mass distributions of $z\sim 1.4$ quasars. Our results on the HOD of central
quasars are in excellent agreement with Richardson et al.\ but the host mass
scale of satellite quasars for the WISE sample, is lower than that of
Richardson et al.\ resulting in an order of magnitude higher satellite fraction
for the WISE sample. We note that our sample of quasars are systematically
brighter in the WISE frequency bands compared to the full quasar sample of
SDSS. We discuss the implication of this result in the context of current
theories of galaxy evolution.

likely to exacerbate in the future. With this in mind, we ask the question: Can
individuals or groups actively manage their connections to evade social network
analysis tools?
  By addressing this question, the general public may better protect their
privacy, oppressed activist groups may better conceal their existence, and
security agencies may better understand how terrorists escape detection. We
first study how an individual can evade ""network centrality"" analysis without
compromising his or her influence within the network. We prove that an optimal
solution to this problem is hard to compute. Despite this hardness, we
demonstrate that even a simple heuristic, whereby attention is restricted to
the individual's immediate neighbourhood, can be surprisingly effective in
practice. For instance, it could disguise Mohamed Atta's leading position
within the WTC terrorist network, and that is by rewiring a strikingly-small
number of connections. Next, we study how a community can increase the
likelihood of being overlooked by community-detection algorithms. We propose a
measure of concealment, expressing how well a community is hidden, and use it
to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple heuristic, whereby members of the
community either ""unfriend"" certain other members, or ""befriend"" some
non-members, in a coordinated effort to camouflage their community.

responsivity for a wide range of 2D flakes. Our results elucidate and

transfer energy between the two transition metal sites. The change in charge
transfer energy due to shift of Cr $d$ states in Sr$_2$CrMoO$_6$ compared to Fe

additional superexchange contribution to magnetism arises with a finite

Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) to investigate the pyramid wavefront
sensor (WFS) ability to measure the differential piston on a sparse aperture.
The ultimate goal is to verify the ability of the pyramid WFS work in closed
loop to perform the phasing of the primary mirrors of a sparse Fizeau imaging
telescope. In the experiment we installed on the optical bench we performed
various test checking the ability to flat the wave-front using a deformable
mirror and to measure the signal of the differential piston on a two pupils
setup. These steps represent the background from which we start to perform full
closed loop operation on multiple apertures. These steps were also useful to
characterize the achromatic double pyramids (double prisms) manufactured in the
SHAO optical workshop.

be DM-dominated and hence promising candidates in the search for 511 keV

of this study is to constrain possible 511 keV gamma-ray signals from 39 DSGs
of the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. We use the spectrometer SPI
on INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects. As the
diffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of
the MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood
analysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum has been
determined. Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3.1 sigma signal. Five other
sources show tentative 2 sigma signals. The mass-to-511-keV-luminosity-ratio
shows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter
objects, opposite to the V band mass-to-light-ratio, which is generally used to
uncover DM in DSGs. All derived flux values are above the level implied by a DM
interpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal from Ret II is unlikely to be
related to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be about 100 times
brighter than what is seen. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample,
and rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity, if its origins
are similar to processes in the MW. Understanding this emission may provide
further clues regarding the origin of the annihilation emission in the MW.

sharing the same incoming light, and whose difference in path length is
continuously adjusted in order to show different signals for different signs of

the path difference should be properly adjusted vs the wavelength used. While
we incidentally describe how this could be achieved in a true optomechanical
setup, we focus our attention to the simulation of a hypothetical ""perfect""

accomplished in a perfect manner and the gain is selectable in a numerical

horizon as the infrared cut-off. The interaction rate between dark energy and
dark matter has been reconstructed for three different parameterizations of the
deceleration parameter. Observational constraints on the model parameters have
been obtained by maximum likelihood analysis using the observational Hubble
parameter data (OHD), type Ia supernovab data (SNe), baryon acoustic
oscillation data (BAO) and the distance prior of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) namely the CMB shift parameter data (CMBShift). The interaction rate
obtained in the present work remains always positive and increases with
expansion. It is very similar to the result obtained in previous findings where
the interaction rate has been reconstructed for a parametrization of the dark
energy equation of state. Tighter constraints on the interaction rate have been
obtained in the present work as it is based on larger data sets. The nature of
the dark energy equation of state parameter has also been studied for the
present models. Though the reconstruction is done from different
parametrizations, the overall nature of the interaction rate is very similar in
all the cases. Different information criteria and the Bayesian evidence, which
have been invoked in the context of model selection, show that the these models
are at close proximity of each other.

This question is challenging to address with the availability of a wide variety

research reported in this paper addresses the above question by proposing a six
step benchmarking methodology in which a user provides a set of weights that
indicate how important memory, local communication, computation and storage
related operations are to an application. The user can either provide a set of
four abstract weights or eight fine grain weights based on the knowledge of the
application. The weights along with benchmarking data collected from the cloud
are used to generate a set of two rankings - one based only on the performance
of the VMs and the other takes both performance and costs into account. The
rankings are validated on three case study applications using two validation
techniques. The case studies on a set of experimental VMs highlight that
maximum performance can be achieved by the three top ranked VMs and maximum
performance in a cost-effective manner is achieved by at least one of the top
three ranked VMs produced by the methodology.

the generalized Riccati parametrization. The junctions can host rich ground
states: $\pi$ phase, $0+\pi$ phase, $\varphi_{0}$ phase and $\varphi$ phase.
The phase transition can be tuned by rotating the magnetization in the
ferromagnetic interface. We present the phase diagrams in the parameter space
formed by the orientation of the magnetization or by the magnitude of the
interfacial potentials. The selection rules for the lowest order current which
are responsible for the formation of the rich phases are summarized from the
current-phase relations based on the numerical calculation. We construct a
Ginzburg-Landau type of free energy for the junctions with ${\bf{d}}$-vectors
and the magnetization, which not only reveals the interaction forms of
spin-triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism but also can directly leads
to the selection rules. In addition, the energies of the Andreev bound states
and the novel symmetries in the current-phase relations are also investigated.
Our results are helpful both in the prediction of the novel Josephson phases
and in the design of the quantum circuits.

double trace perturbations, $\mathbb{O}_n$= $\mathbb{O}(x) (\partial^2)^{n}
{\mathcal O}(x)$, with arbitrary $n$. As well-known, the standard GKPW
prescription, applied to a finite radial cut-off, leads to contact terms in
correlators. de Haro et al (arXiv:hep-th/0002230) introduced bulk counterterms
to remove these. However, this prescription yields additional terms in the
correlator corresponding to spurious double trace deformations. Further, if we
view GKPW prescription coupled with the prescription in arXiv:hep-th/0002230,
in terms of a boundary wavefunction, we find that it is incompatible with
radial Schrodinger evolution (in the spirit of holographic Wilsonian RG). We
consider a more general wavefunction satisfying the Schrodinger equation, and
find that generically such wavefunctions generate both (a) double trace
deformations and (b) contact terms. However, we find that there exist special
choices of these wavefunctions, amounting to a new AdS/CFT prescription at a
finite cut-off, so that both (a) and (b) are removed and we obtain a pure power
law behaviour for the correlator. We compare these special wavefunctions with a
specific RG scheme in field theory. We give a geometric interpretation of these
wavefunctions; these correspond to some specific smearing of boundary points in
the Witten diagrams. We present a comprehensive calculation of exact
double-trace beta-functions for all couplings $\mathbb{O}_n$ and match with a
holographic computation using the method described above. The matching works
with a mapping between the field theory and bulk couplings; such a map is
highly constrained because the beta-functions are quadratic and exact on both
sides. We generalize standard double-trace Wilson-Fisher flow to the space of
the infinite number of couplings.

provides portals to dark sector which contains missing particles at the LHC,
e.g., dark matter (DM) particles. In this paper, working in the simplified
model and taking into consideration the wide decay width effect of the
mediator, we analyze the characteristic signatures of mono-$b$+MET and 2$b$+MET
at the LHC. The latter signature was believed to be ineffective, while we found
that, with the aid of razor shape analysis, it should be as important as the
mono-$b$ signature. In the region of relatively low mediator mass (below a few
hundred GeV), by requiring the signal to background ratio greater than a few
percent, the 2$b$-tagged razor analysis has comparable sensitivity to the
mono-$b$ search; it is even better for mediator lighter than $\sim 200$ GeV.

spray/aerosol flows. The distribution function of the dispersed phase is
governed by a Vlasov-equation, while the velocity field of the propellant
satisfies the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids. The dynamics
of the dispersed phase and of the propellant are coupled through the drag force
exerted by the propellant on the dispersed phase. We present a formal
derivation of this model from a multiphase Boltzmann system for a binary
gaseous mixture, involving the droplets/dust particles in the dispersed phase
as one species, and the gas molecules as the other species. Under suitable
assumptions on the collision kernels, we prove that the sequences of solutions
to the multiphase Boltzmann system converge to distributional solutions to the
Vlasov-Navier-Stokes equation in some appropriate distinguished scaling limit.
Specifically, we assume (a) that the mass ratio of the gas molecules to the
dust particles/droplets is small, (b) that the thermal speed of the dust
particles/droplets is much smaller than that of the gas molecules and (c) that
the mass density of the gas and of the dispersed phase are of the same order of
magnitude.

formal quotients was studied by Waelbroeck already in 1962. In the current

considering first the monomorphism category. Then we localize with respect to a
multiplicative system. Our approach gives rise to a heart-like category not

in which the set of all kernel-cokernel pairs does not form an exact structure.
Such categories arise frequently in functional analysis.

interactions. Superradiant light scattering in a Bose-Einstein condensate is a
fascinating example of such an interaction. It is an analogous process to Dicke
superradiance, in which an electronically inverted sample decays collectively,
leading to the emission of one or more light pulses in a well-defined
direction. Through time-resolved measurements of the superradiant light pulses
emitted by an end-pumped BEC, we study the close connection of superradiant
light scattering with Dicke superradiance. A 1D model of the system yields good
agreement with the experimental data and shows that the dynamics results from
the structures that build up in the light and matter-wave fields along the BEC.
This paves the way for exploiting the atom-photon correlations generated by the
superradiance.

from biological to social interactions, and has important implications for
their functioning and resilience. We analyze a simple three-state model for
bistability in networks under varying unbiased noise. In a fully connected
network increasing noise yields a collapse of bistability to an unpolarised
state. In contrast, in complex networks noise can abruptly switch the
polarization state in an irreversible way. When two networks are combined
through increasing multiplex coupling, one is dominant and progressively
imposes its state on the other, offsetting or promoting the ability of noise to
switch polarization. Our results show that dynamical correlations and asymmetry
in dynamical processes in networks are sufficient for allowing unbiased noise
to produce abrupt irreversible transitions between extremes, which can be
neutralized or enhanced by multiplex coupling.

combining the approach via polynomial representations with the approach via

We study analogues of these algebras and their Auslander-Reiten theory for
reductive algebraic groups $G$ and Borel subgroups $B$ by considering the
categories of polynomial representations of $G_r T$ and $B_r T$ as full
subcategories of $\mathrm{mod} \thinspace G_r T$ and $\mathrm{mod}\thinspace

Auslander-Reiten quiver $\Gamma_s(G_r T)$ of $\mathrm{mod}\thinspace G_r T$

Auslander-Reiten quiver of the infinitesimal Schur algebras in this situation.
For the Borel subgroup $B$ of lower triangular matrices of $\mathrm{GL}_2$, the
category of $B_r T$-modules is related to representations of elementary abelian
groups of rank $r$. In this case, we can extend our results about modules of

we examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself,
in driving network-wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of
neuronal activity, we study how autaptic connections affect activity patterns,
and evaluate if neuronal degree or controllability are significant factors that
affect changes in bursting from these autaptic connections. We observed that
adding increasing numbers of autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
increased the number of spiking events in the network and the number of
network-wide bursts, particularly in the portion of the phase space in which
excitatory synapses were stronger contributors to bursting behavior than
inhibitory synapses. In comparison, autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
with high average controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding
the same number of self-looping connections to neurons with high modal
controllability. The number of autaptic connections required to induce bursting
behavior could be lowered by selectively adding autapses to high degree
excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic connections in
controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of
mammalian brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic
neurophysiological correlates of structural controllability.

construction of this effective magnetic matrix does not require a gap in the
spectrum of the non-magnetic operator, only that the first and the second Bloch
eigenvalues do not cross but their ranges might overlap. The crossing case is
more difficult and will be considered elsewhere.

the appearance of spectral islands separated by gaps.

and (ii) coarse-graining three spins in the Kagome lattice and mapping it to a
square-lattice model with nearest-neighbor interactions, with usual PEPS
tensors, 6- and 12-site unit cells. Similarly to our previous calculation at
the SU(2)-symmetric point (Heisenberg Hamiltonian), for any anisotropy from the
Ising limit to the XY limit, we also observe the emergence of magnetization
plateaus as a function of the magnetic field, at $m_z = \frac{1}{3}$ using 6-
9- and 12-site PEPS unit cells, and at $m_z = \frac{1}{9}, \frac{5}{9}$ and
$\frac{7}{9}$ using a 9-site PEPS unit cell, the later set-up being able to
accommodate $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ solid order. We also find that, at $m_z

almost-degenerate nematic and $1 \times 2$ VBC-Solid orders. Within our
accuracy, the 6-site coarse-grained PEPS method gives slightly lower energies,
which can be explained by the larger amount of entanglement this approach can
handle, even when the PEPS unit-cell is not commensurate with the expected
ground state. Furthermore, we do not observe chiral spin liquid behaviors at

first tensor network investigations of the XXZ spin chain in a field, and

quantum states emerge. Spin-liquid (SL) states of frustrated quantum
antiferromagnets, in which highly-correlated spins keep to fluctuate down to
very low temperatures, are prominent examples of such quantum states. SL states
often exhibit exotic physical properties, but the precise nature of the
elementary excitations behind such phenomena remains entirely elusive. Here we
utilize thermal Hall measurements that can capture the unexplored property of
the elementary excitations in SL states, and report on the observation of
anomalous excitations that may unveil the unique features of the SL state. Our
principal finding is a negative thermal Hall conductivity (k_xy) which the
charge-neutral spin excitations in a gapless SL state of the two-dimensional
kagome insulator volborthite Cu_3V_2O_7(OH)_2 \cdot 2H_2O exhibit, in much the
same way in which charged electrons give rise to the conventional electric Hall
effect. We find that k_xy is absent in the high-temperature paramagnetic state
and develops upon entering the SL state in accordance with the growth of the
short-range spin correlations, demonstrating that k_xy is a key signature of
the elementary excitation formed in the SL state. These results suggest the
emergence of nontrivial elementary excitations in the gapless SL state which
feel the presence of fictitious magnetic flux, whose effective Lorentz force is
found to be less than 1/100 of that experienced by free electrons.

demonstrate that only the polarization component perpendicular to the plates
contribute to the pressure. The obtained pressure can be both repulsive and
attractive depending on whether the polarizations of both plates are
unidirectional or directed in opposite directions. It is shown that although
the constraints on an axion-electron coupling obtained in the case of

strengthen the presently known constraints on the axion-neutron coupling
constants of GUT axions by using both processes of one- and two-axion exchange.

signatures of co-rotating cool clouds or prominences visible in H$\alpha$.
Several prominences on HK Aqr show periodic variability in the prominence
tracks which follow a sinusoidal motion (indication of prominence
oscillations). On PZ Tel we could not find any periodic variability in the
prominence tracks. By fitting sinusoidal functions to the prominence tracks we
derive amplitudes and periods which are similar to those of large amplitude
oscillations seen in solar prominences. In one specific event we also derive a
periodic variation of the prominence track in the H$\beta$ spectral line which
shows an anti-phase variation with the one derived for the H$\alpha$ spectral

Here we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects:
the finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the
uncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in
the limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible
for infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects

result of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation
induce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30%
for most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be
neglected for bins smaller than $\Delta z = 0.1$ roughly.

interested in creating urban areas that are both lively and safe. But are the
safety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent characteristics? Or are they
just two sides of the same coin? In a world where people avoid unsafe looking
places, neighborhoods that look unsafe will be less lively, and will fail to
harness the natural surveillance of human activity. But in a world where the
preference for safe looking neighborhoods is small, the connection between the
perception of safety and liveliness will be either weak or nonexistent. In this
paper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the
perception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining
mobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of
perceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a
dataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual
perception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking neighborhoods are more
active than what is expected from their population density, employee density,
and distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the correlation between
appearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and significant, for
females and people over 50, but negative for people under 30, suggesting that
the behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic of the
population. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban features
that contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery and street
facing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in agreement with
Oscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest that urban
appearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a
neighborhood's rate of natural surveillance.

removing observations completely at random or in blocks of different sizes.
Several default imputation methods are included with the package, including

The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or
remove additional methods using a simple two-step process. The testbench
compares the actual missing and imputed data for each method with different
error metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Alternative error metrics can
also be supplied by the user. The simplicity of use and significant reduction

development on vertical slicing has already started in late 4G and early 5G and
