communication together with illumination using LED lighting. However,
conventional forward error correction (FEC) codes for reliable communication do
not have the features for dimming support and flicker mitigation which are
required in VLC for the main functionality of lighting. Therefore, auxiliary
coding techniques are usually needed, which eventually reduce the coding
efficiency and increase the complexity. In this paper, a polar codes-based FEC
coding scheme for dimmable VLC is proposed to increase the coding efficiency
and simplify the coding structure. Experimental results show that the proposed
scheme has the following advantages: 1) equal probability of 1's and 0's in
codewords, which is inherently supporting 50% dimming balance; 2) short run
length property (about 90% bits have runs shorter than 5) which can avoid
flickers and additional run-length limited line coding; 3) higher coding
efficiency about twofold than that of other coding schemes; 4) capacity
achieving error correction performance with low-complexity encoding and
decoding, which is about 3 dB higher coding gain than that of RS(64,32) in IEEE
standard for dimming ratio 50% and about 1 dB higher coding gain than that of
LDPC codes for dimming ratio 25% (or 75%).

physics. For practical purposes they are the prevalent building blocks for
materials where nuclear properties are of interest. Here, however, we are
focusing on fundamental properties of the actinides related to their electronic
structure and characteristic bonding in the condensed state. The series of
actinides is naturally divided into two segments. First, the set of lighter
actinides thorium through plutonium, often referred to as the early actinides,
display variations of their atomic volume reminiscent of transition metals
suggesting a gradual occupation of bonding 5f states. Second, the heavier (or
late) actinides, Am and onwards, demonstrate a volume behavior comparable to
the rare-earth metals thus implying nonbonding 5f states. Arguably, one can
distinguish plutonium metal as special case lying between these two subsets
because it shares some features from both. Therefore, we discuss the early
actinides, plutonium metal, and the late actinides separately applying
first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. The analysis
includes successes and failures of the theory to describe primarily phase
stability, bonding, and electronic structure.

planes, there are calculated the thermodynamic characteristics in general form
for arbitrary temperatures, namely: the thermodynamic potential, energy,
entropy, equations of state, heat capacities and compressibilities. The
distance between planes is considered as an additional thermodynamic variable.
Owing to the anisotropy, the pressure of the Fermi gas along and transverse to
the planes is different, so that the system is characterized by two equations
of state and a set of different heat capacities. Limiting cases of low and high
temperatures are considered. The temperature dependencies of the entropy and
heat capacities at low temperatures remain linear, just as in the volume case,
and their dependencies on the chemical potential and density undergo jumps at
the beginning of the filling of new discrete levels. It is shown that the
behavior of thermodynamic quantities with the distance between plates can be
either oscillating or monotonic, depending on what quantity is assumed to be
fixed: the volume or surface density. For high temperatures the corrections to
thermodynamic quantities are obtained, which are proportional to the ratio of
the thermal de Broglie wavelength to the distance between planes.

supersoft ultraluminous (SSUL) regime with a spectrum dominated by a cool
($\sim 0.1$ keV) blackbody component and the soft ultraluminous (SUL) regime
with comparable luminosities shared by the blackbody and power-law components.
Multi-epoch observations revealed an anti-correlation between the blackbody
radius and temperature, $R_{\rm bb} \propto T_{\rm bb}^{-2.8 \pm 0.3}$, ruling
out a standard accretion disk as the origin of the soft X-ray emission. The
soft X-ray emission is much more variable on both short and long timescales in
the SSUL regime than in the SUL regime. We suggest that the SSUL regime may be
an extension of the ultraluminous state toward the high accretion end, being an
extreme case of the SUL regime, with the blackbody emission arising from the
photosphere of thick outflows and the hard X-rays being emission leaked from
the embedded accretion disk via the central low-density funnel or advected
through the wind. However, the scenario that the supersoft ULXs are standard
ULXs viewed nearly edge-on cannot be ruled out. Flux dips on a timescale of 200
s were observed. The dips cannot be explained by an increase of absorption, but
could be due to the change of accretion rate or related to thermal fluctuations
in the wind or disk. The optical emission of NGC 247 ULX exhibits a blackbody
spectrum at a temperature of 19,000 K with a radius of 20 $R_\odot$, likely

time $\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t}$ and over space $\nabla \rho $, in
addition to the fluid velocity vector field $\vec{u}(\vec{x},t)$ and the fluid
density $\rho (\vec{x},t)$ itself. We derive the conditions for the

scenarios when the fluid density is not constant $\rho(\vec{x},t)\neq const$

Pbca space group and parameters a = 9.5-9.8, b = 8.9-9.1, c = 17.1-17.3 $\AA$).
The main hydrogen groups in samples are C-H groups connected by aliphatic
bonds. The synthesized graphanes at atmospheric pressure are stable up to 500
C. The macroscopic density of CH samples is 1.5-1.57 g cm$^{-3} $ and the
refractive index is 1.78-1.80. The absorption spectra of samples with a high
degree of crystallization exhibits a weak absorption maximum at 2.8 eV, which
is responsible for the yellow-orange color, large absorption maximum at 4 eV
and an absorption edge associated with the width of the optical gap at 5.2 eV.
The bulk modulus (30-37 GPa) and shear modulus (15-18 GPa) of the fabricated
samples, as well as their hardness (1-1.5 GPa), are about twice as high as the
respective values for polycrystalline graphite. The solution of metalorganic
complexes in benzene and pyridine makes it possible to obtain doped graphanes,
which can have extraordinary electron transport and magnetic properties.

of the Galactic center (GC). The super-massive black hole (SMBH) might strip
planets or planetary embryos from their parent star, bringing them close enough
to be tidally disrupted. Photoevaporation by the ultraviolet field of young
stars, combined with ongoing tidal disruption, could enhance the near-infrared
luminosity of such starless planets, making their detection possible even with
current facilities. In this paper, we investigate the chance of planet tidal
captures by means of high-accuracy N-body simulations exploiting Mikkola's
algorithmic regularization. We consider both planets lying in the clockwise
(CW) disk and planets initially bound to the S-stars. We show that tidally
captured planets remain on orbits close to those of their parent star.
Moreover, the semi-major axis of the planet orbit can be predicted by simple
analytic assumptions in the case of prograde orbits. We find that starless
planets that were initially bound to CW disk stars have mild eccentricities and
tend to remain in the CW disk. However, we speculate that angular momentum
diffusion and scattering with other young stars in the CW disk might bring
starless planets on low-angular momentum orbits. In contrast, planets initially
bound to S-stars are captured by the SMBH on highly eccentric orbits, matching
the orbital properties of the G1 and G2 clouds. Our predictions apply not only
to planets but also to low-mass stars initially bound to the S-stars and
tidally captured by the SMBH.

imaging. For habitable exoplanets in particular, located at small angular
separation from the host star, it is crucial to employ small inner working
angle (IWA) coronagraphs that efficiently suppress starlight. These
coronagraphs, in turn, require careful control of the wavefront which directly
impacts their performance. For ground-based telescopes, atmospheric refraction
is also an important factor, since it results in a smearing of the PSF, that
can no longer be efficiently suppressed by the coronagraph. Traditionally,
atmospheric refraction is compensated for by an atmospheric dispersion
compensator (ADC). ADC control relies on an a priori model of the atmosphere
whose parameters are solely based on the pointing of the telescope, which can
result in imperfect compensation. For a high contrast instrument like the
Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system, which employs
very small IWA coronagraphs, refraction-induced smearing of the PSF has to be
less than 1 mas in the science band for optimum performance. In this paper, we
present the first on-sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric
dispersion. Atmospheric dispersion is measured from the science image directly,
using an adaptive grid of artificially introduced speckles as a diagnostic to
feedback to the telescope's ADC. With our current setup, we were able to reduce
the initial residual atmospheric dispersion from 18.8 mas to 4.2 in broadband
light (y- to H-band), and to 1.4 mas in H-band only. This work is particularly
relevant to the upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs) that will require
fine control of their ADC to reach their full high contrast imaging potential.

molecule, is a ubiquitous chemical mechanism in biology. Multisite
phosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups to multiple sites of a single

bistable, while processive systems were recently shown to be globally stable.
However, this global convergence result was proven only for a specific
mechanism of processive phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (namely, all
catalytic reactions are reversible). Accordingly, we generalize this result to
allow for processive phosphorylation networks in which each reaction may be
irreversible, and also to account for possible product inhibition. We
accomplish this by defining an all-encompassing processive network that
encapsulates all of these schemes, and then appealing to recent results of
Marcondes de Freitas, Wiuf, and Feliu that assert global convergence by way of
monontone systems theory and network/graph reductions (which correspond to
removal of intermediate complexes). Our results form a case study into the
question of when global convergence is preserved when reactions and/or
intermediate complexes are added to or removed from a network.

shearing amplitude, $\gamma_0$. In addition, we identify hysteresis in the

Stokes flows in heterogeneous perforated domains. The challenge in the
numerical simulations of this problem lies in the fact that the solution
contains many multiscale features and requires a very fine mesh to resolve all
details. In order to efficiently compute the solutions, some model reductions
are necessary. To obtain a reduced model, we apply the generalized multiscale
finite element approach, which is a framework allowing systematic construction
of reduced models. Based on this general framework, we will first construct a
local snapshot space, which contains many possible multiscale features of the
solution. Using the snapshot space and a local spectral problem, we identify
dominant modes in the snapshot space and use them as the multiscale basis
functions. Our basis functions are constructed locally with non-overlapping
supports, which enhances the sparsity of the resulting linear system. In order
to enforce the mass conservation, we propose a hybridized technique, and uses a
Lagrange multiplier to achieve mass conservation. We will mathematically
analyze the stability and the convergence of the proposed method. In addition,
we will present some numerical examples to show the performance of the scheme.
We show that, with a few basis functions per coarse region, one can obtain a

n})$ of the corresponding instanton moduli space is the moduli space of charge
$k$ (noncommutative) instantons on origami spacetimes. There, $X$ is modelled
on a union of (up to six) coordinate complex planes ${\bf C}^{2}$ intersecting
in $Z$ modelled on ${\bf C}^{4}$. The instantons are shared by the collection
of four dimensional gauge theories sewn along two dimensional defect surfaces
and defect points. We also define several quiver versions ${\bf M}_{\bf
k}^{\gamma}({\vec{\bf n}})$ of ${\bf M}_{k}({\vec n})$, motivated by the
considerations of sewn gauge theories on orbifolds ${\bf C}^{4}/{\Gamma}$.
  The geometry of the spaces ${\bf M}_{\bf k}^{\gamma}({\vec{\bf n}})$, more
specifically the compactness of the set of torus-fixed points, for various
tori, underlies the non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger identities recently found
to be satisfied by the correlation functions of $qq$-characters viewed as local
gauge invariant operators in the ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ quiver gauge theories.
  The cohomological and K-theoretic operations defined using ${\bf M}_{k}({\vec
n})$ and their quiver versions as correspondences provide the geometric
counterpart of the $qq$-characters, line and surface defects.

theories accross different energy scales. Even though their expressions at
two-loop for an arbitrary gauge field theory have been known for more than
thirty years, deriving the full set of equations for a given model by hand is
very challenging and prone to errors. To tackle this issue, we have introduced
in [1] a Python tool called PyR@TE; Python Renormalization group equations @
Two-loop for Everyone. With PyR@TE, it is easy to implement a given Lagrangian
and derive the complete set of two-loop RGEs for all the parameters of the
theory. In this paper, we present the new version of this code, PyR@TE 2, which
brings many new features and in particular it incorporates kinetic mixing when
several $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge groups are involved. In addition, the group
theory part has been greatly improved as we introduced a new Python module
dubbed PyLie that deals with all the group theoretical aspects required for the
calculation of the RGEs as well as providing very useful model building
capabilities. This allows the use of any irreducible representation of the
$\mathrm{SU}(n)$, $\mathrm{SO}(2n)$ and $\mathrm{SO(2n+1)}$ groups. %
Furthermore, it is now possible to implement terms in the Lagrangian involving
fields which can be contracted into gauge singlets in more than one way. As a
byproduct, results for a popular model (SM+complex triplet) for which, to our
knowledge, the complete set of two-loop RGEs has not been calculated before are
presented in this paper. Finally, the two-loop RGEs for the anomalous dimension
of the scalar and fermion fields have been implemented as well. It is now
possible to export the coupled system of beta functions into a numerical C++
function, leading to a consequent speed up in solving them.

high [OIII] $\lambda$5008/H$\beta$ ratios (log([OIII]/H$\beta$) $\sim$ 0.8) and
low [NII] $\lambda$6585/H$\alpha$ ratios (log([NII]/H$\alpha$) $<-1.15$). Using

strong, hard ionizing continua are required to reproduce our observed line
ratios, suggesting that faint galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing
photons and important analogs of reionization-era galaxies. Furthermore, we
investigate physical trends accompanying Ly$\alpha$ emission across the largest
current sample of combined Ly$\alpha$ and rest-optical galaxy spectroscopy,
including 60 faint LAEs and 368 more luminous galaxies at similar redshifts. We
find that Ly$\alpha$ emission is strongly correlated with nebular excitation

metallicity plays a strong role in determining the observed properties of these
galaxies by modulating their stellar spectra, nebular excitation, and dust
content.

searched for their mid- and far-infrared counterparts at 9, 18, and 90 $\mu$m.
As a result, 69 Seyfert galaxies in the MAXI catalog (48 type-1 and 21 type-2
ones) were found to be detected with AKARI. The X-ray (3-4 keV and 4-10 keV)
and infrared luminosities of these objects were investigated, together with
their color information. Adopting the canonical photon index, $\Gamma = 1.9$,
of the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray hardness
ratio between the 3-4 and 4-10 keV ranges derived with MAXI was roughly
converted into the absorption column density. After the X-ray luminosity was
corrected for absorption from the estimated column density, the well-known
X-ray-to-infrared luminosity correlation was confirmed at least in the
Compton-thin regime. In contrast, NGC 1365, only one Compton-thick object in
the MAXI catalog, was found to deviate from the correlation toward a
significantly lower X-ray luminosity by nearly an order of magnitude. It was
verified that the relation between the X-ray hardness below 10 keV and
X-ray-to-infrared color acts as an effective tool to pick up Compton-thick

Assuming point particles and total encounter energies $\le$ 0, the problem has
three possible outcomes. We describe each outcome as a series of discrete
transformations in energy space, using the diagrams first presented in Leigh \&
Geller (2012; see the Appendix). Furthermore, we develop a formalism for
calculating probabilities for these outcomes to occur, expressed using the
density of escape configurations per unit energy, and based on the Monaghan
description originally developed for the three-body problem. We compare this
analytic formalism to results from a series of binary-binary encounters with
identical point particles, simulated using the \texttt{FEWBODY} code. Each of
our three encounter outcomes produces a unique velocity distribution for the
escaping star(s). Thus, these distributions can potentially be used to
constrain the origins of dynamically-formed populations, via a direct
comparison between the predicted and observed velocity distributions. Finally,
we show that, for encounters that form stable triples, the simulated single
star escape velocity distributions are the same as for the three-body problem.
This is also the case for the other two encounter outcomes, but only at low
virial ratios. This suggests that single and binary stars processed via
single-binary and binary-binary encounters in dense star clusters should have a
unique velocity distribution relative to the underlying Maxwellian distribution
(provided the relaxation time is sufficiently long), which can be calculated
analytically.

galaxy group. We fit power-law surface number density profiles of the form
$\Sigma_{N, R_{\rm gc}}\propto R_{\rm gc}^\Gamma$ and find that inside the
transition radius, the red GCs are more centrally concentrated than the blue,
with $\Gamma_{\rm inner,red}\approx-1.78$ and $\Gamma_{\rm
inner,blue}\approx-1.40$. Outside this region both profiles flatten, more
dramatically for the red GCs ($\Gamma_{\rm outer,red}\approx-0.33$) compared to
the blue ($\Gamma_{\rm outer,blue}\approx-0.61$), although the former is more
likely to suffer contamination by background sources. The median
$(g'\!-\!z')_0\!=\!1.27$mag colour of the inner red population is consistent
with arising from the amalgamation of two giant galaxies each less luminous
than present-day NGC5128. Both in- and out-ward of the transition radius, we
find the fraction of blue GCs to dominate over the red GCs, indicating a lively
history of minor-mergers. Assuming the blue GCs to originate primarily in dwarf
galaxies, we model the population required to explain them, while remaining
consistent with NGC5128's present-day spheroid luminosity. We find that several
dozen dwarfs of luminosities $L_{dw,V}\simeq10^{6-9.3}L_{V,\odot}$, following a
Schechter luminosity function with a faint-end slope of
$-1.50\leq\alpha\leq-1.25$ is favoured, many of which may have already been
disrupted in NGC5128's tidal field.

specifically studied how the time evolution of $\alpha(r)$ is affected by
initial size, mass, binary fraction, primordial mass segregation, black hole

Previous studies have shown that the evolution of $\alpha_G$ is closely related
to the amount of mass loss suffered by a cluster. Hence for each simulation we
have also followed the evolution of the slope of the cluster's global stellar
mass function, $\alpha_G$, and have shown that clusters follow a well-defined
track in the $\alpha_G$-$d\alpha(r)/d(ln(r/r_m))$ plane. The location of a

severely constrains flavor changing interactions, due to restrictive limits on
the $Z^{\prime}$ mass. We discuss this interplay explicitly in the well
motivated framework of a 3-3-1 scheme, where fermions and scalars are arranged
in the fundamental representation of the weak SU(3) gauge group. Due to the
paucity of relevant parameters, we conclude dilepton data leave little room for
a possible new physics signal stemming from these systems, unless a very

phase-space kinematics and chemistry out to ~70 kpc. A maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) estimate method and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are
applied, taking into account the selection function in positions, distance, and
metallicity for the survey. The best-fit EDF declines with actions less steeply
at actions characteristic of the inner halo than at the larger actions
characteristic of the outer halo, and older ages are found at smaller actions
than at larger actions. In real space, the radial density profile steepens
smoothly from -2 at ~2 kpc to -4 in the outer halo, with an axis ratio ~0.7
throughout. There is no indication for rotation in the BHBs, although this is
highly uncertain. A moderate level of radial anisotropy is detected, with
$\beta_s$ varying from isotropic to between ~0.1 and ~0.3 in the outer halo

-0.03 Gyr kpc$^{-1}$, with some uncertainty in the distribution of the larger

detected at TeV $\gamma$-rays and the only one with an identified X-ray jet.
Combined observations of Fermi-LAT at high energies (HE) and of H.E.S.S at very
high energies (VHE) revealed a striking spectral property of Ap Librae; the
presence of a broad high-energy component that extends more than nine orders of
magnitude in energy and is, therefore, hard to be explained by the usual
single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We show that the superposition of
different emission components related to photohadronic interactions can explain
the $\gamma$-ray emission of Ap Librae without invoking external radiation
fields. We present two indicative model fits to the spectral energy
distribution of Ap Librae where the VHE emission is assumed to originate from a
compact, sub-pc scale region of the jet. A robust prediction of our model is
VHE flux variability on timescales similar to those observed at X-rays and HE
$\gamma$-rays, which can be further used to distinguish between a sub-pc or kpc
scale origin of the TeV emission. We thus calculate the expected variability
signatures at X-rays, HE and VHE $\gamma$-rays and show that quasi-simultaneous
flares are expected, with larger amplitude flares appearing at $\gamma$-rays.
We assess the detectability of VHE variability from Ap Librae with CTA, next
generation of IACTs. We show that $\sim$hr timescale variability at
$E_{\gamma}>0.1$ TeV could be detectable at high significance with shorter

companies to raise awareness of goods and services in the marketplace.
Advertising campaigns are designed to convey a marketing image or message to an
audience of potential consumers and television commercials can be an effective
way of transmitting these messages to a large audience. In order to meet the
requirements for a typical advertising order, television content providers must
provide advertisers with a predetermined number of ""impressions"" in the target
demographic. However, because the number of impressions for a given program is
not known a priori and because there are a limited number of time slots
available for commercials, scheduling advertisements efficiently can be a
challenging computational problem. In this case study, we compare a variety of
methods for estimating future viewership patterns in a target demographic from
past data. We also present a method for using those predictions to generate an
optimal advertising schedule that satisfies campaign requirements while
maximizing advertising revenue.

Previously, power allocation in $M$-1-1 systems have assumed availability of

this paper we consider an $M$-1-1 Decode-and-Forward (DF), Full-Duplex,
orthogonal frequencey division multiple access (OFDMA) based relay system with
statistical-CSI and analyze the achievable rate $R$ of such a system. We show
how $R$ can only be maximized by numerical power allocation schemes which has a
high-complexity of order $\mathcal O(M^3)$. By introducing a rational
approximation in the achievable rate analysis, we develop two low-complexity
power allocation schemes that can obtain a system achievable rate very close to
the maximum $R$. Most importantly, we show that the complexity of our power
allocation schemes is of order $\mathcal O(M\log M)$. We then show how our
power allocation schemes are suitable for a multi-user relay system, where
either the priority is to maximize system throughput, or where lower
computations in power allocation scheme are essential. The work we present in
this paper will be of value to the design and implementation of real-time

the transport of injected fast ions, we contrast the qualitative features of
their transport with that of the heated minorities. Our results indicate that
heated minorities are more strongly affected by microturbulence than injected
fast ions. The physical interpretation of this difference provides a possible
explanation for the observed synergy when NBI heating is combined with ICRH.
Furthermore, we move beyond the trace approximation to develop a model which
allows one to easily account for the reduction of anomalous transport due to
the presence of fast ions in electrostatic turbulence.

theoretical approaches grounded in Euclidean methods (e.g., lattice QCD,
Dyson-Schwinger Equations [DSEs]) as opposed to traditional Minkowski field
theories (such as light-front constituent quark models). ${\bf Purpose}$
Seeking to bridge these complementary worldviews, we explore the potential of a
Euclidean constituent quark model (ECQM). This formalism enables us to study
the gluonic dressing of the quark-level axial-vector vertex, which we undertake
as a test of the framework. ${\bf Method}$ To access its indispensable elements
with a minimum of inessential detail, we develop our ECQM using the simplified
quark $+$ scalar diquark picture of the nucleon. We construct a hyperspherical
formalism involving polynomial expansions of diquark propagators to marry our
ECQM with the results of Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) analyses, and constrain
model parameters by fitting electromagnetic form factor data. ${\bf Results}$
From this formalism, we define and compute a new quantity --- the Euclidean
density function (EDF) --- an object that characterizes the nucleon's various
charge distributions as functions of the quark's Euclidean momentum. Applying
this technology and incorporating information from BSE analyses, we find the
dressing effect on the proton's axial-singlet charge to be small in magnitude
and consistent with zero. ${\bf Conclusions}$ The scalar quark $+$ diquark ECQM
is a step toward a realistic quark model in Euclidean space, and urges
additional refinements. The small size we obtain for the impact of the dressed
vertex on the axial-singlet charge suggests that models without this effect are
on firm ground to neglect it.

exactly, by means of self-consistently optimized Lagrange multipliers, and

components of a generalized DFT+$U$ functional. The latter approach prevails in
our tests on a model one-electron system, $H_2^+$, in that it readily recovers

so. The generalized DFT+$U$ functional moreover enables the simultaneous
correction of the total-energy and ionization potential or the correction of

Interesting features include transmission gain as well as broad operating
bandwidth and angular sector operation. It is finally shown that the
metasurface is bianisotropic in nature, with nonreciprocity due to the

operations with a certain symmetry. Under such restriction, a system in a
symmetry-breaking state can be used as a catalyst, e.g. to prepare another
system in a desired symmetry-breaking state. This sort of (approximate)
catalytic state transformations are relevant in the context of (i) state
preparation using a bounded-size quantum clock or reference frame, where the
clock or reference frame acts as a catalyst, (ii) quantum thermodynamics, where
again a clock can be used as a catalyst to prepare states which contain
coherence with respect to the system Hamiltonian, and (iii) cloning of unknown
quantum states, where the given copies of state can be interpreted as a
catalyst for preparing the new copies. Using a recent result of Fawzi and
Renner on approximate recoverability, we show that the achievable accuracy in
this kind of catalytic transformations can be determined by a single function,
namely the relative entropy of asymmetry, which is equal to the difference
between the entropy of state and its symmetrized version: if the desired state
transition does not require a large increase of this quantity, then it can be
implemented with high fidelity using only symmetric operations. Our lower bound
on the achievable fidelity is tight in the case of cloners, and can be achieved
using the Petz recovery map, which interestingly turns out to be the optimal
cloning map found by Werner.

infected by an infected neighbor with the same rate. However, the infection
rate between a pair of nodes is usually heterogeneous and even correlated with
their nodal degrees in the contact network. We aim to understand how such
correlated heterogeneous infection rates influence the spreading on different
network topologies. Motivated by real-world datasets, we propose a correlated
heterogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model which assumes that the
infection rate $\beta_{ij}(=\beta_{ji})$ between node $i$ and $j$ is correlated
with the degree of the two end nodes: $\beta_{ij}=c(d_id_j)^\alpha$, where
$\alpha$ indicates the strength of the correlation and $c$ is selected so that
the average infection rate is $1$. In order to understand the effect of such
correlation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding
uncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,
where the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled
and reallocated to the links of the same network topology. We compare these two
scenarios in the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state on
Erd{\""o}s-R{\'e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) networks with a similar average
degree. Through the continuous-time simulations, we find that, when the
recovery rate is small, the negative correlation is more likely to help the
epidemic spread and the positive correlation prohibit the spreading; as the
recovery rate increases to be larger than a critical value, the positive but
not negative correlation tends to help the spreading. Our findings are further
analytically proved in a wheel network (one central node connects with each of
the nodes in a ring) and validated on real-world networks with correlated
heterogeneous interaction frequencies.

deployed to monitor various target locations. Targets are the points in the
physical space at which events of some interest, such as random faults or
attacks, can occur. Most often, these devices have limited energy supplies, and
they can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficient
monitoring of various target locations through a set of monitoring devices with
limited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In this
paper, we study optimal scheduling of monitoring devices to maximize network
coverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given network
lifetime. The monitoring devices considered could remain active only for a
fraction of the overall network lifetime. We formulate the problem of
scheduling of monitoring devices as a graph labeling problem, which unlike
other existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying network
structure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. In
this direction, first we propose a greedy heuristic to solve the graph labeling
problem, and then provide a game-theoretic solution to achieve near optimal
graph labeling. Moreover, the proposed setup can be used to simultaneously
solve the scheduling and placement of monitoring devices, which yields improved
performance as compared to separately solving the placement and scheduling
problems. Finally, we illustrate our results on various networks, including
real-world water distribution networks.

showed that bidisperse mixtures of filamentous viruses can self-assemble into
colloidal monolayers with thermodynamically stable rafts exhibiting chiral

observations by modeling the membrane particles as chiral liquid crystals.
Chiral twist promotes the formation of finite-sized rafts and mediates a
repulsion that distributes them evenly throughout the membrane. Although this
system is composed of filamentous viruses whose aggregation is entropically
driven by dextran depletants instead of phospholipids and cholesterol with
prominent electrostatic interactions, colloidal and biological membranes share
many of the same physical symmetries. Chiral twist can contribute to the

power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position and
investigate the influence of external forces on the resulting anomalous
diffusion. The heterogeneous diffusion processes can yield subdiffusion as well
as superdiffusion, depending on the behavior of the diffusion coefficient. We
assume that not only the diffusion coefficient but also the external force has
a power-law dependence on the position. We obtain analytic expressions for the
transition probability in two cases: when the power-law exponent in the
external force is equal to 2eta-1, where 2eta is the power-law exponent in the
dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position, and when the external
force has a linear dependence on the position. We found that the power-law
exponent in the dependence of the mean square displacement on time does not
depend on the external force, this force changes only the anomalous diffusion
coefficient. In addition, the external force having the power-law exponent
different from 2eta-1 limits the time interval where the anomalous diffusion
occurs. We expect that the results obtained in this paper may be relevant for a
more complete understanding of anomalous diffusion processes.

  We also present a faster algorithm that, for any $n$-player $k$-strategy
anonymous game, runs in time $\tilde O((n+k) k n^k)$ and computes an $\tilde
O(n^{-1/3} k^{11/3})$-approximate equilibrium. This algorithm follows from the
existence of simple approximate equilibria of anonymous games, where each
player plays one strategy with probability $1-\delta$, for some small $\delta$,
and plays uniformly at random with probability $\delta$.
  Our approach exploits the connection between Nash equilibria in anonymous

to two observable EFG reorientation rates, and these reorientation rates were
found to be strongly dependent on EFG orientation. Calculations using density
functional theory were used to reduce the number of unknowns in the model with

precision the total jump rate of Cd among Ga(2) sites that correspond to a
change in mirror plane orientation of site-symmetry. This total jump rate was

a fully distributed learning-based bidding algorithm which relies only on local

formation in a society polarized along two opinions, say opinions 1 and 2. The
model comes with interaction strength $\beta>0$ and bais $h$. Here the
population in question is divided into three main groups, namely: Group one
consisting of individuals who have decided on opinion 1. Let the proportion of
this group be given by $s$. Group two consisting of individauls who have chosen
opinion 2. Let $r$ be their proportion.
  Group three consisting of individuals who are yet to decide and they will
decide based on their environmental conditions. Let $1-s-r$ be the proportion
of this group. We show that the specific magnetization of the associated
conditional Curie-Weiss model has a first order phase transition (discontinuous
jump in specific magnetization) at $\beta^*=\left(1-s-r\right)^{-1}$. It is
also shown that not all the discontinuous jumps in magnetization will result in
phase change. We point out how an extention of this model could serve as a
random field Curie-Weiss model where the random field distribution has
nonvanishing mean.

parameters, making them difficult to be deployed and updated on devices with
limited resources such as mobile phones and other smart embedded systems. In
this paper, we propose a scalable representation of the network parameters, so
that different applications can select the most suitable bit rate of the
network based on their own storage constraints. Moreover, when a device needs
to upgrade to a high-rate network, the existing low-rate network can be reused,
and only some incremental data are needed to be downloaded. We first
hierarchically quantize the weights of a pre-trained deep neural network to
enforce weight sharing. Next, we adaptively select the bits assigned to each
layer given the total bit budget. After that, we retrain the network to
fine-tune the quantized centroids. Experimental results show that our method
can achieve scalable compression with graceful degradation in the performance.

miss some dominant patents from the identified main paths; nonetheless, the
high network complexity of their main paths makes qualitative tracing of
trajectories problematic. The proposed method searches backward and forward
paths from the high-persistence patents which are identified based on a
standard genetic knowledge persistence algorithm. We tested the new method by
applying it to the desalination and the solar photovoltaic domains and compared
the results to output from the same domains using a prior method. The empirical
results show that the proposed method overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks

existing method.

Europa, neglected the effect of the eccentricity of Jupiter's orbit around the
Sun, the effect of the emissivity and heat capacity of Europa's ice, the effect
of the eclipse of Europa (i.e., the relative time that Europa is within the
shadow of Jupiter), the effect of Jupiter's radiation, and the effect of
Europa's internal heating. Other studies concentrated on the diurnal cycle but
neglected some of the above factors. In addition, to our knowledge, the
seasonal cycle of the surface temperature of Europa was not estimated. Here we
systematically estimate the diurnal, seasonal and annual mean surface
temperature of Europa, when Europa's obliquity, emissivity, heat capacity, and
eclipse, as well as Jupiter's radiation, internal heating, and eccentricity,
are all taken into account. For a typical internal heating rate of 0.05 W
m$^{-2}$, the equator, pole, and the global and mean annual mean surface
temperatures are 96K, 46K, and 90K, respectively. We found that the temperature
at the high latitudes is significantly affected by the internal heating,
especially during the winter solstice, suggesting that measurements of high
latitude surface temperatures can be used to constrain the internal heating. We
also estimate the incoming solar radiation to Enceladus, the moon of Saturn.

the force prediction errors were about 2% or smaller with respect to the

event observed on December 26, 2015. Both events were inferred to have arisen
from the merger of black holes in binary systems. Such a system may emit
neutrinos if there are magnetic fields and disk debris remaining from the
formation of the two black holes. With the surface detector array of the Pierre
Auger Observatory we can search for neutrinos with energy above 100 PeV from
point-like sources across the sky with equatorial declination from about -65
deg. to +60 deg., and in particular from a fraction of the 90% confidence-level
(CL) inferred positions in the sky of GW150914 and GW151226. A targeted search
for highly-inclined extensive air showers, produced either by interactions of
downward-going neutrinos of all flavors in the atmosphere or by the decays of
tau leptons originating from tau-neutrino interactions in the Earth's crust
(Earth-skimming neutrinos), yielded no candidates in the Auger data collected
within $\pm 500$ s around or 1 day after the coordinated universal time (UTC)
of GW150914 and GW151226, as well as in the same search periods relative to the
UTC time of the GW candidate event LVT151012. From the non-observation we
constrain the amount of energy radiated in ultrahigh-energy neutrinos from such
remarkable events.

that in any dimension, the system has Ising dynamics in strong atom-photon

frustrated quantum Ising model and its phase diagram as well as existence of
Majorana like edge modes in different phases of the model. The fermionic
version of the frustrated quantum Ising problem is also presented. On a
different but related note, we present some beautiful results on Falicov
Kimball (FK) model, a fermionic model similar to Hubbard model, on a square
lattice. Using a canonical representation for electrons (invented by Brijesh
Kumar), the FK model is mapped to classical Ising model (at infinite Hubbard

to study magnetization as a function of Hubbard interaction and also as a

colloidal dispersion drop in a confined geometry. We developed an original
methodology based on Raman micro-spectroscopy to measure spatially-resolved
colloids concentration profiles during the drying of the drop. These
measurements lead, for the first time, to estimates of the collective diffusion
coefficient of the dispersion over a wide range of concentration. The
collective diffusion coefficient is one order of magnitude higher than the
Stokes-Einstein estimate showing the importance of the electrostatic
interactions for the relaxation of concentration gradients. At the same time,
we also performed fluorescence imaging of tracers embedded within the
dispersion during the drying of the drop, which reveals two distinct regimes.
At early stages, concentration gradients along the drop lead to
buoyancy-induced flows. Strikingly, these flows do not influence the colloidal
concentration gradients that generate them, as the mass transport remains
dominated by diffusion. At longer time scales, the tracers trajectories reveal
the formation of a gel which dries quasi homogeneously. For such a gel, we show
using linear poro-elastic modeling, that the drying dynamics is still described
by the same transport equations as for the liquid dispersion. However, the
collective diffusion coefficient follows a modified generalized Stokes-Einstein

CZT Imager of AstroSat on its very first day of operation detected a long
duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) namely GRB 151006A. Using the off-axis imaging
and spectral response of the instrument, we demonstrate that CZT Imager can
localise this GRB correct to about a few degrees and it can provide, in
conjunction with Swift, spectral parameters similar to that obtained from
Fermi/GBM. Hence CZT Imager would be a useful addition to the currently
operating GRB instruments (Swift and Fermi). Specifically, we argue that the
CZT Imager will be most useful for the short hard GRBs by providing
localisation for those detected by Fermi and spectral information for those
detected only by Swift. We also provide preliminary results on a new exciting
capability of this instrument: CZT Imager is able to identify Compton scattered
events thereby providing polarisation information for bright GRBs. GRB 151006A,
in spite of being relatively faint, shows hints of a polarisation signal at
100-300 keV (though at a low significance level). We point out that CZT Imager
should provide significant time resolved polarisation measurements for GRBs
that have fluence 3 times higher than that of GRB 151006A. We estimate that the
number of such bright GRBs detectable by CZT Imager is 5 - 6 per year. CZT
Imager can also act as a good hard X-ray monitoring device for possible

microscopic spin-spin correlations of the frustrated honeycomb lattice

diffraction. A three dimensional (3D) long-range antiferromagnetic ordering has
been found below TN ~ 24.8 K. The magnetic ground state, determined to be
zigzag antiferromagnet [k = (1/2 0 0)], occurs due to the competing exchange
interactions up to third nearest neighbors within the honeycomb lattice. The
exceptional existence of a limited magnetic correlation length along the c axis
(perpendicular to the honeycomb layers in the ab planes) has been found within
the 3D long-range ordered state, even at 1.8 K, well below TN. The observed
limited correlation along the c axis is explained by the disorder distribution
of the Na ions within the intermediate layers. The reduced ordered moments
mCo(1) = 2.77(3) muB/Co2+ and mCo(2) = 2.45(2) muB/Co2+ at 1.8 K reflect the
persistence of spin fluctuations in the ordered state. Above TN, the presence
of short-range magnetic correlations, manifested by broad diffuse magnetic
peaks, has been found. Reverse Monte Carlo analysis of the experimental diffuse
magnetic scattering data reveals that the spin correlations are mainly confined
within the 2D honeycomb layers (ab plane) with a correlation length of ~ 12
{\AA} at 25 K. The nature of spin arrangements is found to be similar in both
the short-range and long-range ordered magnetic states. This implies that the
short-range correlation grows with decreasing temperature and leads to the
zigzag AFM ordering at T < TN. The present study provides a comprehensive
picture of the magnetic correlations over the temperature range above and below
TN and their relation to the crystal structure. The role of intermediate soft
Na-layers on the magnetic coupling between honeycomb planes is discussed.

field approximation, which neglects all spatial dependence in the forces
experienced by the electron after ionization. More recently, the small spatial
inhomogeneity introduced by the long-range Coulomb potential has been linked to
a number of important features in the photoelectron spectrum, such as Coulomb
asymmetry, Coulomb focusing, and the low energy structure (LES). Here, we
demonstrate by combined quantum and classical simulations that a small
time-varying spatial dependence in the laser electric field creates a prominent
higher energy peak at energies above the ""classical cut-off"" for direct
electrons. This higher energy structure (HES) originates from direct electrons
ionized near the peak of a single half-cycle of the laser pulse. The HES is
separated from all other ionization events (providing sub-cycle resolution) and
is highly sensitive to the carrier envelope phase (CEP). The large accumulation
of electrons with tuneable energy suggests a promising method for creating a
localized source of electron pulses of attosecond duration using tabletop laser
technology.

groups that we call $\mathrm L^1$ full groups. These groups are endowed with a
Polish group topology which admits a natural complete right invariant metric.
We mostly focus on $\mathrm L^1$ full groups of measure-preserving $\mathbb
Z$-actions which are actually a complete invariant of flip conjugacy.
  We prove that for ergodic actions the closure of the derived group is
topologically simple although it can fail to be simple. We also show that the
closure of the derived group is connected, and that for measure-preserving free
actions of non-amenable groups the closure of the derived group and the
$\mathrm L^1$ full group itself are never amenable.
  In the case of a measure-preserving ergodic $\mathbb Z$-action, the closure
of the derived group is shown to be the kernel of the index map. If such an
action is moreover by homeomorphism on the Cantor space, we show that the
topological full group is dense in the $\mathrm L^1$ full group. Using
Juschenko-Monod and Matui's results on topological full groups, we conclude
that $\mathrm L^1$ full groups of ergodic $\mathbb Z$-actions are amenable as
topological groups, and that they are topologically finitely generated if and

assistants in the context of human-robot interactions (HRI), to demonstrate
their trustworthiness through corroborative evidence of their safety and
functional correctness. Key challenges include the complex and unpredictable
nature of the real world in which assistant and service robots operate, the
limitations on available V&V techniques when used individually, and the
consequent lack of confidence in the V&V results. Our approach, called
corroborative V&V, addresses these challenges by combining several different
V&V techniques; in this paper we use formal verification (model checking),
simulation-based testing, and user validation in experiments with a real robot.
We demonstrate our corroborative V&V approach through a handover task, the most
critical part of a complex cooperative manufacturing scenario, for which we
propose some safety and liveness requirements to verify and validate. We
construct formal models, simulations and an experimental test rig for the HRI.
To capture requirements we use temporal logic properties, assertion checkers
and textual descriptions. This combination of approaches allows V&V of the HRI
task at different levels of modelling detail and thoroughness of exploration,
thus overcoming the individual limitations of each technique. Should the
resulting V&V evidence present discrepancies, an iterative process between the
different V&V techniques takes place until corroboration between the V&V
techniques is gained from refining and improving the assets (i.e., system and
requirement models) to represent the HRI task in a more truthful manner.
Therefore, corroborative V&V affords a systematic approach to 'meta-V&V,' in
which different V&V techniques can be used to corroborate and check one
another, increasing the level of certainty in the results of V&V.

These claims are based on a low momentum expansion of the interaction vertex
that cannot be applied to the vertex factors containing both low and high
momenta inside the loop-integrals. Elaborating upon the important steps of the
momentum shell decimation scheme, employed in the renormalization-group
calculation, we explicitly show the interplay of internal (high) and external
(low) momenta determining the loop integrals for self-energy and vertex
functions giving rise to corrections (to the bare parameters) different from
those of the standard (short-ranged) \Phi^4 theory. Employing explicit
mathematical arguments, we show that this difference persists when the range of
interaction is assumed to be long (short) ranged with respect to the lattice
constant (correlation-length), yielding the critical exponents as given in the

ion-beam to damage diamond in conjunction with variable thickness masks. This
process changes significantly the structural proprieties of the target
material, because the ion nuclear energy loss induces carbon conversion from
sp3 to sp2 state mainly at the end of range of the ions (few micrometers).
Furthermore, placing a mask with increasing thickness on the sample it is
possible to modulate the channels depth at their endpoints, allowing their
electrical connection with the surface. A single-crystal HPHT diamond sample
was implanted with 1.8 MeV He+ ions at room temperature, the implantation
fluence was set in the range 2.1x10^16 - 6.3x10^17 ions cm^-2, determining the
formation of buried micro-channels at 3 um. After deposition of metallic
contacts at the channels' endpoints, the electrical characterization was
performed measuring the I-V curves at variable temperatures in the 80-690 K
range. The Variable Range Hopping model was used to fit the experimental data
in the ohmic regime, allowing the estimation of characteristic parameters such
as the density of localized states at the Fermi level. A value of 5.5x10^17
states cm-3 eV-1 was obtained, in satisfactory agreement with values previously
reported in literature. The power-law dependence between current and voltage is
consistent with the space charge limited mechanism at moderate electric fields.

(AR) outflows at coronal altitudes higher than those reached by other
instrumentation. These outflows are thought to be a component of the slow solar
wind. Our purpose is to study the evolution of the outflows in the intermediate
corona from AR 8100, from the time the AR first forms until it dissolves, after
several transits at the solar limb. Data acquired by SOHO/UVCS at the time of
the AR limb transits, at medium latitudes and at altitudes ranging from 1.5 to
2.3 R_sun, were used to infer the physical properties of the outflows through
the AR evolution. To this end, we applied the Doppler dimming technique to UVCS
spectra. These spectra include the H I Lyman alpha line and the O VI doublet
lines at 1031.9 and 1037.6 A. Plasma speeds and electron densities of the
outflows were inferred over several rotations of the Sun. AR outflows are
present in the newly born AR and persist throughout the entire AR life.
Moreover, we found two types of outflows at different latitudes, both possibly
originating in the same negative polarity area of the AR. We also analyzed the
behavior of the Si XII 520 A line along the UVCS slit in an attempt to reveal
changes in the Si abundance when different regions are traversed. Although we

early as 7000 years ago: jewels, amulets, seals and inlays are examples of
objects produced using this material. Only few sources of Lapis Lazuli exist in
the world due to the low probability of geological conditions in which it can
form, so that the possibility to associate the raw material to man-made objects
helps to reconstruct trade routes. Since art objects produced using Lapis
Lazuli are valuable, only non-destructive investigations can be carried out to
identify the provenance of the raw materials. Ionoluminescence (IL) is a good
candidate for this task. Similarly to cathodoluminescence (CL), IL consists in
the collection of luminescence spectra induced by MeV ion (usually protons)
irradiation. The main advantage of IL consists in the possibility of working in
air while measuring simultaneously the composition of major and trace element
by means of complementary Ion Beam Analysis techniques like PIXE or PIGE
(Particle Induce X-ray or Gamma-ray Emission). In the present work a systematic
study of the luminescence properties of Lapis Lazuli under charged particles
irradiation is reported. In a first phase a multi-technique approach was
adopted (CL, SEM with microanalysis, micro-Raman) to characterise luminescent
minerals. This characterisation was propaedeutic for IL/PIXE/PIGE measurements
carried out on significant areas selected on the basis of results obtained
previously. Criteria to identify provenance of Lapis Lazuli from four of the
main sources (Afghanistan, Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, Chile and Siberia)
were proposed.

significantly from the X-ray luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation

luminosity measurement combining XMM-Newton and ROSAT, this could most likely
be caused by the bias in the velocity dispersion due to interlopers and low
member statistic in the previous sample of member galaxies, which was solely
based on 20 galaxy redshifts drawn from the literature. Aims: We intend to
increase the galaxy member statistic to perform a precision measurement of the
velocity dispersion and dynamical mass of S1101. We aim for a detailed
substructure and dynamical state characterization of this cluster, and a
comparison of mass estimates derived from (i) the velocity dispersion (M_vir),
(ii) the caustic mass computation (M_caustic), and (iii) mass proxies from
X-ray observations and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Methods: We carried
out new optical spectroscopic observations of the galaxies in this cluster
field with VIMOS, obtaining a sample of ~60 member galaxies for S1101. We
revised the cluster redshift and velocity dispersion measurements based on this
sample and also applied the Dressler-Shectman substructure test. Results: The
completeness of cluster members within r200 was significantly improved for this
cluster. Tests for dynamical substructure did not show evidence for major
disturbances or merging activities in S1101. We find good agreement between the
dynamical cluster mass measurements and X-ray mass estimates which confirms the
relaxed state of the cluster displayed in the 2D substructure test. The SZ mass
proxy is slightly higher than the other estimates. The updated measurement of
the velocity dispersion erased the deviation of S1101 in the L-sigma relation.

in Herzsprung-Russell diagrams at ages $\sim$ 1-10 Myr. They also confirm that
early accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a
previous study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results
strengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young
clusters should be extremely rare. We also find that early phases of burst
accretion can produce coeval models of similar mass with a range of different
Li surface abundances, and in particular with Li-excess compared to the
predictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle
competition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central
stellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion
of fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a
subtle combination of effects. This new result could explain the recent,

bath of the de Sitter field theory using holography. Unlike the temperature of
a thermal field theory in flat spacetime, the temperature of a superconformal
field theory on de Sitter space is an integral part of the theory and leaves
intact the conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. In the dual AdS side, there is
no black hole. Instead we have cosmological expansion of the de Sitter factor.
We consider a number of different observables, such as the entanglement
entropy, two point correlation function, Wilson loops corresponding to static
and spinning mesons in the field theory, and study their thermal properties
using holography. The former two quantities have trivial temperature dependence
due to conformal symmetry. We compute the energy of the quark anti-quark bound
state for a static meson, as well as the energy and the angular momentum for a
spinning meson. We find that there is a maximum distance, as well as a maximum
spin for the latter case, beyond which the bound state become unstable. The
temperature behavior of the physical quantities in these meson systems are
similar to that of the usual thermal field theory with holographic black hole
dual. With these examples, we show clearly how the field theory observables get
their thermal properties from the bulk despite the absence of a black hole,
with the role of the black hole horizon played by the cosmological expansion of
the de Sitter factor of the AdS metric.

this paper, a reliable full reference IQA model is proposed that utilize
gradient similarity (GS), chromaticity similarity (CS), and deviation pooling
(DP). By considering the shortcomings of the commonly used GS to model human
visual system (HVS), a new GS is proposed through a fusion technique that is
more likely to follow HVS. We propose an efficient and effective formulation to
calculate the joint similarity map of two chromatic channels for the purpose of
measuring color changes. In comparison with a commonly used formulation in the
literature, the proposed CS map is shown to be more efficient and provide
comparable or better quality predictions. Motivated by a recent work that
utilizes the standard deviation pooling, a general formulation of the DP is
presented in this paper and used to compute a final score from the proposed GS
and CS maps. This proposed formulation of DP benefits from the Minkowski
pooling and a proposed power pooling as well. The experimental results on six
datasets of natural images, a synthetic dataset, and a digitally retouched
dataset show that the proposed index provides comparable or better quality
predictions than the most recent and competing state-of-the-art IQA metrics in

playing the role of activators, inhibitors or products of biochemical network
operation. Activities may have given duration, i.e., the time required to
obtain results. An entity may represent an object (e.g., an agent, a

some modularity. As main results we show that ANDy systems have finite state

usual Minkowski Functionals which are scalar quantities. We introduce them here
for use in cosmological analysis, in particular to analyze CMB maps. They
encapsulate information about the shapes and the orientation of structures. We
focus on one of the TMFs, namely $W_2^{1,1}$, which is the generalization of
the genus. The ratio of the eigenvalues of the average of $W_2^{1,1}$ over all
structures, $\alpha$, encodes the net orientation; and the average of the
ratios of the eigenvalues of $W_2^{1,1}$ for each structure, $\beta$, encodes
the net anisotropy. We have developed a code that computes $W_2^{1,1}$, and
from it $\alpha$ and $\beta$, for a set of structures on the plane. We compute
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ as functions of threshold levels for simulated Gaussian
and isotropic CMB fields. We obtain $\alpha$ to be one for both temperature and
$E$ mode, which means that we recover the input statistical isotropy of density
fluctuations in the simulations. The level of net anisotropy of hotspots and
coldspots in the CMB fields is quantified by $\beta\sim 0.62$. Then we compute
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ for data from PLANCK. We find that the temperature field
agrees with the standard LCDM prediction of no net orientation within
$3-\sigma$. However, we find that $E$ mode data shows a net orientation that
deviates from the theoretical expectation at $14-\sigma$. The possible origin
of this deviation may be instrumental effects or other sources and needs to be
investigated further. For the net anisotropy we obtain values of $\beta$ for
both temperature and $E$ mode that are consistent with the expectations from
the standard LCDM simulations. Accurate measurements of $\alpha$ and $\beta$
can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and to search for
deviations from it.

lack of excitation of some degrees of freedom, of the Noether currents
associated with physical symmetries leads to emergent gauge symmetries in

Adviser: XUE,JIANGENG",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, two different optical management techniques for organics
based solar cells are explored. The first part is focused on the development of
a textured rear reflector for OPVs. The use of textured reflector (TR)
facilitates an increase in the optical path length along with light trapping
within the active layer. TR was fabricated through a relatively simpler
technique by depositing metal films over a microlens array (MLA). Zinc oxide
nanoparticles were used to minimize the shadowing effect. Using TR,
enhancements in short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiencies
up to 10-25% were demonstrated for a polymer based organic solar cell. The
second part is focused on improving the effectiveness of MLA incorporation in
OPVs. The increase in path length achieved using MLA can be improved by
increasing the refractive index of MLA and incorporating MLA directly on the
transparent electrode instead of glass substrate. This approach could avoid the
optical losses occurring at the interface between MLA and glass substrate and
increase the net path length of light within the active layer. Initial
experimental results are discussed to understand the potential of this
approach. Approximately, ~15% enhancement in short-circuit current density was
achieved by using MLA directly on the transparent electrode in ITO-free
devices.

of users (and therefore their connectivity in social networks), we provide a
precise evaluation of how topological metrics of the social network impact the
final user ranking. Our approach is the following : we first model the ranking
service as a black-box with which we interact by creating user profiles and by
performing operations on them. Through those profiles, we trigger some slight
topological modifications. By monitoring the impact of these modifications on
the rankings of those profiles, we infer the weight of each topological metric
in the black-box, thus reversing the service influence cookbook.

theoretical point of view it has been argued that the MAP estimate is only in

it has been proven that the MAP estimate is a proper Bayes estimator for the

extend this result to other noise models with log-concave likelihood density,
by introducing two related Bregman cost functions for which the CM and the MAP

allows one to access the nucleon's weak charge, the vector coupling of the
$Z$-boson to the nucleon. In the Standard Model and at tree level, the weak
charge of the proton is related to the weak mixing angle and accidentally
suppressed, $Q_W^{p,\,{\rm tree}}=1-4\sin^2\theta_W\approx0.07$. Modern
experiments aim at extracting $Q_W^p$ at $\sim1\%$ accuracy. Similarly, parity
non-conservation in atoms allows to access the weak charge of atomic nuclei. We
consider a novel class of radiative corrections, an exchange of two photons
with parity violation in the hadronic/nuclear system. These corrections may
affect the extraction of $\sin^2\theta_W$ from the experimental data at the
relevant level of precision because they are affected by long-range
interactions similar to other parity-violating radiative corrections, such as,
e.g., the $\gamma Z$-exchange, which has obtained much attention recently. We
show that the significance of this new correction increases with the beam
energy in parity-violating electron scattering, but the general properties of
the parity-violating forward Compton amplitude protect the formal definition of
the weak charge as a limit at zero-momentum transfer and zero-energy. We also
discuss the relevance of the new correction for upcoming experiments.

  http://www.bafst.com/events/asplos16/bpoe7/",,,,"cs.AR cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Response time requirements for big data processing systems are shrinking. To
meet this strict response time requirement, many big data systems store all or
most of their data in main memory to reduce the access latency. Main memory
capacities have grown, and systems with 2 TB of main memory capacity available
today. However, the rate at which processors can access this data--the memory
bandwidth--has not grown at the same rate. In fact, some of these big-memory
systems can access less than 10% of their main memory capacity in one second
(billions of processor cycles).
  3D die-stacking is one promising solution to this bandwidth problem, and
industry is investing significantly in 3D die-stacking. We use a simple
back-of-the-envelope-style model to characterize if and when the 3D die-stacked
architecture is more cost-effective than current architectures for in-memory
big data workloads. We find that die-stacking has much higher performance than
current systems (up to 256x lower response times), and it does not require
expensive memory over provisioning to meet real-time (10 ms) response time
service-level agreements. However, the power requirements of the die-stacked
systems are significantly higher (up to 50x) than current systems, and its
memory capacity is lower in many cases. Even in this limited case study, we
find 3D die-stacking is not a panacea. Today, die-stacking is the most
cost-effective solution for strict SLAs and by reducing the power of the
compute chip and increasing memory densities die-stacking can be cost-effective
under other constraints in the future.

We find circularly polarized light can invert the ordering of this three band
model, while leaving the flat-band dispersionless. We find a small gap is also
opened at the quadratic band touching point by 2-photon and higher order
processes. By contrast, linearly polarized light splits the quadratic band
touching point (into two Dirac points) by an amount that depends only on the
amplitude and polarization direction of the light, independent of the
frequency, and generally renders dispersion to the flat band. The splitting is
perpendicular to the direction of the polarization of the light. We derive an
effective low-energy theory that captures these key results. Finally, we
compute the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity for this 3-band
model and analyze the various interband contributions of the Floquet modes. Our
results suggest strategies for optically controlling band structure and

complex organic molecules such as GA, methyl formate (MF), dimethyl ether (DME)
and ethanol (ET). The high angular resolution images show that the EG emission
is very compact, peaking towards the maximum of the continuum. These
observations suggest that low abundance complex organic molecules, like EG or
GA, are good probes of the gas located closer to the forming stars. Our
analysis confirms that EG is more abundant than GA in G31.41+0.31, as
previously observed in other interstellar regions. Comparing different
star-forming regions we find evidence of an increase of the EG/GA abundance
ratio with the luminosity of the source. The DME/MF and EG/ET ratios are nearly
constant with luminosity. We have also found that the abundance ratios of pairs
of isomers GA/MF and ET/DME decrease with the luminosity of the sources. The
most likely explanation for the behavior of the EG/GA ratio is that these
molecules are formed by different chemical formation routes not directly
linked; although warm-up timescales effects and different formation and
destruction efficiencies in the gas phase cannot be ruled out. The most likely
formation route of EG is by combination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on dust
grains. We also favor that GA is formed via the solid-phase dimerization of the
formyl radical HCO, and a chemical link between MF and DME.

is the observation that the power in the E-mode polarization is twice that in
the B mode, as opposed to pre-Planck expectations of roughly equal dust powers
in E and B modes. Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the
detailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.
These fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\'en
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to
magnetic-field pressures is specified. We also parametrize models in terms of
the power amplitudes and power anisotropies for the three types of waves. We
find that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE
correlation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD
turbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization
fluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30
pc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not
described by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that
drives ISM turbulence. We develop a simple phenomenological model, based on
random displacements of the magnetized fluid, that produces EE/BB $\simeq2$ and
a positive TE cross-correlation. According to this model, the EE/BB and TE
signals are due to longitudinal, rather than transverse, modes in the
random-displacement field, providing, perhaps, some clue to the mechanism that
stirs the ISM. Future investigations involving the spatial dependence of the
EE/BB ratio, TE correlation, and local departures from statistical isotropy in
dust-polarization maps, as well as further tests of some of the assumptions in
this analysis, are outlined. This work may also aid in the improvement of
foreground-separation techniques for studies of CMB polarization.

both challenges and opportunities to the system performance. On one hand, the
load demand from EV charging imposes large impact on the stability and
efficiency of power grid. On the other hand, EVs could potentially act as
mobile energy storage systems to improve the power network performance, such as
load flattening, fast frequency control, and facilitating renewable energy
integration. Evidently, uncontrolled EV charging could lead to inefficient
power network operation or even security issues. This spurs enormous research
interests in designing charging coordination mechanisms. A key design challenge
here lies in the lack of complete knowledge of events that occur in the future.
Indeed, the amount of knowledge of future events significantly impacts the
design of efficient charging control algorithms. This article focuses on
introducing online EV charging scheduling techniques that deal with different

  Data without Trajectories","26 pages, 14 figures",,,,"physics.data-an stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Viewing a data set such as the clouds of Jupiter, coherence is readily
apparent to human observers, especially the Great Red Spot, but also other
great storms and persistent structures. There are now many different
definitions and perspectives mathematically describing coherent structures, but
we will take an image processing perspective here. We describe an image
processing perspective inference of coherent sets from a fluidic system
directly from image data, without attempting to first model underlying flow
fields, related to a concept in image processing called motion tracking. In
contrast to standard spectral methods for image processing which are generally
related to a symmetric affinity matrix, leading to standard spectral graph
theory, we need a not symmetric affinity which arises naturally from the
underlying arrow of time. We develop an anisotropic, directed diffusion
operator corresponding to flow on a directed graph, from a directed affinity
matrix developed with coherence in mind, and corresponding spectral graph
theory from the graph Laplacian. Our methodology is not offered as more
accurate than other traditional methods of finding coherent sets, but rather
our approach works with alternative kinds of data sets, in the absence of
vector field. Our examples will include partitioning the weather and cloud
structures of Jupiter, and a local to Potsdam, N.Y. lake-effect snow event on
Earth, as well as the benchmark test double-gyre system.
