functions is centrosymmetric, while the phase is antisymmetric. As a
consequence of this, elastic scattering of plane wave photons or electrons
within the first-order Born-approximation as well as Fraunhofer diffraction on
any aperture, is bound to result in centrosymmetric diffraction patterns.
Friedel's law, however, does not apply for vortex beams, and centrosymmetry in
general is not present in their diffraction patterns. In this work we extend
Friedel's law for vortex beams by showing that the diffraction patterns of
vortex beams with opposite topological charge, scattered on the same two
dimensional potential, always are centrosymmetric to one another, regardless of
the symmetry of the scattering object. We verify our statement by means of
numerical simulations and experimental data. Our research provides deeper
understanding in vortex beam diffraction and can be used to design new
experiments to measure the topological charge of vortex beams with diffraction
gratings, or study general vortex beam diffraction.

interesting point of ensemble teacher learning is the asymptotic behavior of
the student to approach the true teacher by learning from ensemble teachers.
The student performance is improved by using the Hebbian learning rule in the
learning. However, the perceptron learning rule cannot improve the student
performance. On the other hand, we proposed a perceptron learning rule with a
margin. This learning rule is identical to the perceptron learning rule when
the margin is zero and identical to the Hebbian learning rule when the margin
is infinity. Thus, this rule connects the perceptron learning rule and the
Hebbian learning rule continuously through the size of the margin. Using this
rule, we study changes in the learning behavior from the perceptron learning
rule to the Hebbian learning rule by considering several margin sizes. From the
results, we show that by setting a margin of kappa > 0, the effect of an
ensemble appears and becomes significant when a larger margin kappa is used.

of input and output signals, and we synthesize a transducer that realizes psi.
One weakness of automated synthesis in practice is that it pays no attention to
the quality of the synthesized system. Indeed, the classical setting is
Boolean: a computation satisfies a specification or does not satisfy it.
Accordingly, while the synthesized system is correct, there is no guarantee
about its quality. In recent years, researchers have considered extensions of
the classical Boolean setting to a quantitative one. The logic LTL[F] is a
multi-valued logic that augments LTL with quality operators. The satisfaction
value of an LTL[F] formula is a real value in [0,1], where the higher the value
is, the higher is the quality in which the computation satisfies the
specification.
  Decision problems for LTL become search or optimization problems for LFL[F].
In particular, in the synthesis problem, the goal is to generate a transducer
that satisfies the specification in the highest possible quality.
  Previous work considered the worst-case setting, where the goal is to
maximize the quality of the computation with the minimal quality. We introduce
and solve the stochastic setting, where the goal is to generate a transducer
that maximizes the expected quality of a computation, subject to a given
distribution of the input signals. Thus, rather than being hostile, the
environment is assumed to be probabilistic, which corresponds to many realistic
settings. We show that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete, like classical LTL
synthesis, and remains so in two extensions we consider: one that maximizes the
expected quality while guaranteeing that the minimal quality is, with
probability $1$, above a given threshold, and one that allows assumptions on
the environment.

They arise as 'companion poles' in the propagators of quark-antiquark seed
states when accounting for hadronic loop contributions to the self-energies of
the latter. Such a mechanism may explain the overpopulation in the scalar
sector - there exist more resonances with total spin $J=0$ than can be
described within a quark model.
  Along this line, we study an effective Lagrangian approach where the
isovector state $a_{0}(1450)$ couples via both non-derivative and derivative
interactions to pseudoscalar mesons. It is demonstrated that the propagator has
two poles: a companion pole corresponding to $a_{0}(980)$ and a pole of the
seed state $a_{0}(1450)$. The positions of these poles are in quantitative
agreement with experimental data. Besides that, we investigate similar models
for the isodoublet state $K_{0}^{\ast}(1430)$ by performing a fit to $\pi K$
phase shift data in the $I=1/2,$ $J=0$ channel. We show that, in order to fit
the data accurately, a companion pole for the $K_{0}^{\ast}(800)$, that is, the
light $\kappa$, is required. A large-$N_{c}$ study confirms that both
resonances below $1$ GeV are predominantly four-quark states, while the heavy

that for generic metrics the number of solutions is finite, for fixed

nearby clusters in the HIFLUGCS. The luminosity measurements are obtained based
on ~1.3 Ms of clean XMM data and ROSAT pointed observations. The masses are
estimated using optical spectroscopic redshifts of 13647 cluster galaxies in
total. Given sufficient numbers of member galaxies in computing the dynamical
masses, the L-M relations agree between the disturbed and undisturbed clusters.
The cool-core clusters still dominate the scatter in the L-M relation even when
a core corrected X-ray luminosity is used, which indicates that the scatter
mainly reflects the structure formation history of the clusters. As shown by
the clusters with a small number of redshifts, the dynamical masses can be
underestimated leading to a biased scaling relation. To investigate the
potential of spectroscopic surveys to follow up high-redshift galaxy
clusters/groups observed in X-ray surveys for the identifications and mass
calibrations, we carried out Monte-Carlo re-sampling of the cluster galaxy
redshifts and calibrated the uncertainties of the redshift and dynamical mass
estimates when only reduced numbers of galaxy redshifts per cluster are
available. The re-sampling considers the SPIDERS and 4MOST configurations,
designed for the follow-up of the eROSITA clusters, and was carried out for
each cluster at the actual cluster redshift as well as at z=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and
0.8. For following up very distant cluster/groups, we carried out the mass
calibration based on the re-sampling with only 10zs/cluster, and redshift
calibration based on the re-sampling with only 5zs/cluster and 10zs/cluster,
respectively. Our results demonstrate the power of combining upcoming X-ray and
optical spectroscopic surveys for mass calibration. The scatter in the
dynamical mass estimates for the clusters with at least ten members is within
50%.

  Control",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has recently been a flood of interest in potential new applications of
blockchains, as well as proposals for more generic designs called public
ledgers. Most of the novel proposals have been in the financial sector.
However, the public ledger is an abstraction that solves several of the
fundamental problems in the design of secure distributed systems: global time
in the form of a strict linear order of past events, globally consistent and
immutable view of the history, and enforcement of some application-specific
safety properties. This paper investigates the applications of public ledgers
to access control and, more specifically, to group management in distributed
systems where entities are represented by their public keys and authorization
is encoded into signed certificates. It is particularly difficult to handle
negative information, such as revocation of certificates or group membership,
in the distributed setting. The linear order of events and global consistency
simplify these problems, but the enforcement of internal constraints in the
ledger implementation often presents problems. We show that different types of
revocation require slightly different properties from the ledger. We compare
the requirements with Bitcoin, the best known blockchain, and describe an
efficient ledger design for membership revocation that combines ideas from
blockchains and from web-PKI monitoring. While we use certificate-based
group-membership management as the case study, the same ideas can be applied
more widely to rights revocation in distributed systems.

hard X-ray (HXR) pulsations in solar flares. We concentrate on disk flares
whose impulsive phase are accompanied by a series of more than three peaks
(pulsations) of HXR emission detected in the RHESSI 50-100 keV channel with
4-second cadence. 29 such flares observed from February 2002 to June 2015 with
time differences between successive peaks of 8-270 s are studied. The main
observational result is that sources of HXR pulsations in all flares are not
stationary, they demonstrate apparent displacements from pulsation to
pulsation. The flares can be subdivided into two groups depending on character
of dynamics of HXR sources. The group-1 consists of 16 flares (55%) with
systematic dynamics of HXR sources from pulsation to pulsation with respect to
a magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL), which has simple extended trace on
the photosphere. The group-2 consists of 13 flares (45%) with more chaotic
displacements of HXR sources with respect to an MPIL having more complicated
structure. Based on the observations we conclude that the mechanism of flare
HXR pulsations is related to successive triggering of energy release in
different magnetic loops. Group-1 flare regions consist of loops stacked into
magnetic arcades extended along MPILs. Group-2 flare regions have more
complicated magnetic structures and loops are arranged more chaotically. We
also found that at least 14 (88%) group-1 flares and 11 (85%) group-2 flares
are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, i.e. the majority of flares studied
are eruptive events. This gives an indication that eruptive processes play
important role in generation of HXR pulsations. We suggest that an erupting
flux rope can act as a trigger of energy release. Its successive interaction
with different loops can lead to apparent motion of HXR sources and to a series
of HXR pulsations.

Applied 7, 024026 (2017)","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.7.024026",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chipscale microresonators with integrated planar optical waveguides are
useful building blocks for linear, nonlinear and quantum optical devices. Loss
reduction through improving fabrication processes has resulted in several
integrated micro resonator platforms attaining quality (Q) factors of several
millions. However only few studies have investigated design-dependent losses,
especially with regard to the resonator coupling section. Here we investigate
design-dependent parasitic losses, described by the coupling ideality, of the
commonly employed microresonator design consisting of a microring resonator
waveguide side-coupled to a straight bus waveguide. By systematic
characterization of multi-mode high-Q silicon nitride microresonator devices,
we show that this design can suffer from low coupling ideality. By performing
full 3D simulations to numerically investigate the resonator to bus waveguide
coupling, we identify the coupling to higher-order bus waveguide modes as the
dominant origin of parasitic losses which lead to the low coupling ideality.
Using suitably designed bus waveguides, parasitic losses are mitigated, and a
nearly unity ideality and strong overcoupling (i.e. a ratio of external
coupling to internal resonator loss rate > 9) are demonstrated. Moreover we
find that different resonator modes can exchange power through the coupler,
which therefore constitutes a mechanism that induces modal coupling, a
phenomenon known to distort resonator dispersion properties. Our results
demonstrate the potential for significant performance improvements of
integrated planar microresonators, achievable by optimized coupler designs.

potentially infinite number of previously unseen labels. The infinite-label
learning fundamentally expands the scope of conventional multi-label learning,
and better models the practical requirements in various real-world

of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To
answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot
learning, where the key is to represent a class/label by a vector of semantic
codes, as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We validate the
infinite-label learning by a PAC bound in theory and some empirical studies on
both synthetic and real data.

mean-field dynamics of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in a pancake-shaped
confinement is discussed. The stability of a quasi-two-dimensional condensate,
with respect to the tilting angle, is found to be different from a
two-dimensional layer of dipoles, indicating the relevance of the transverse
extension while characterizing two-dimensional dipolar systems. An anisotropic
excitation spectrum exhibiting a highly tunable, rotonlike minimum can arise
entirely from the dipole-dipole interactions, by tilting the dipoles. At the
magic angle and in the absence of contact interactions, the long-wavelength
excitations are not phononlike and always unstable. The post-roton-instability
dynamics, in contrast to phonon instability, in a uniform condensate, is
featured by a transient, defect-free, stripe pattern, which eventually
undergoes local collapses, and driving the condensate back into the stable
regime can make them sustained for longer. Hopping between stripes has been
observed before it melts into a uniform state in the presence of dissipation.
Finally, we discuss a class of solutions, in which a quasi-two-dimensional
condensate is self-trapped in one direction, as well as a regime of interaction
parameters, including attractive short-range interactions, at which a
two-dimensional anisotropic soliton can be stabilized, and we show that a
chromium condensate with a relatively small number of atoms is well suited for
this.

Recently, Van Gucht, Williams, Woodruff and Zhang [PODS 2015] considered the
complexity of such problems in the natural model of (classical) two-party
communication complexity and obtained tight bounds for the complexity of
several important distributed set joins.
  In this paper we initiate the study of the *quantum* communication complexity
of distributed set joins. We design a quantum protocol for distributed Boolean
matrix multiplication, which corresponds to computing the composition join of
two databases, showing that the product of two $n\times n$ Boolean matrices,
each owned by one of two respective parties, can be computed with
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\ell^{3/4})$ qubits of communication, where $\ell$
denotes the number of non-zero entries of the product. Since Van Gucht et al.
showed that the classical communication complexity of this problem is
$\widetilde{\Theta}(n\sqrt{\ell})$, our quantum algorithm outperforms classical
protocols whenever the output matrix is sparse. We also show a quantum lower
bound and a matching classical upper bound on the communication complexity of
distributed matrix multiplication over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
  Besides their applications to database theory, the communication complexity
of set joins is interesting due to its connections to direct product theorems
in communication complexity. In this work we also introduce a notion of
*all-pairs* product theorem, and relate this notion to standard direct product
theorems in communication complexity.

electroweak symmetry breaking and the associated electroweak phase transition
has become the most pressing question in particle physics. Answering this
question is a priority for experimental studies. Data from the LHC and future
lepton collider-based Higgs factories may uncover new physics coupled to the
Higgs boson, which can induce the electroweak phase transition to become first
order. Such a phase transition generates a stochastic background of
gravitational waves, which could potentially be detected by a space-based
gravitational wave interferometer. In this paper, we survey a few classes of
models in which the electroweak phase transition is strongly first order. We
identify the observables that would provide evidence of these models at the LHC
and next-generation lepton colliders, and we assess whether the corresponding
gravitational wave signal could be detected by eLISA. We find that most of the
models with first order electroweak phase transition can be covered by the
precise measurements of Higgs couplings at the proposed Higgs factories. We
also map out the model space that can be probed with gravitational wave
detection by eLISA.

recently, a type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase has been proposed, where the

between the two types of WSMs (type-I and type-II) is that in the latter,
chiral anomaly and the associated longitudinal magneto-resistance are strongly
anisotropic, vanishing when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the
direction of tilt of Weyl fermion cones in a type-II WSM. We analyze chiral

three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs) built out of Weyl nodes with a
monopole charge $n$. For $n=1$, $2$, and $3$ we realize single, double, and
triple WSM, respectively, and the monopole charge $n$ determines the integer
topological invariant of the WSM. Within the linearized continuum description,
the quasiparticle spectrum is then composed of Landau levels (LLs), containing
exactly $n$ number of chiral zeroth Landau levels (ZLLs), irrespective of the
orientation of the magnetic field. In the presence of strong backscattering,
for example, (due to quenched disorder associated with random impurities),
these systems generically give rise to longitudinal magnetotransport.
Restricting ourselves to the quantum limit (and assuming only the subspace of
the ZLLs to be partially filled) and mainly accounting for Gaussian impurities,
we show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) in all members of the
Weyl family displays a positive linear-$B$ scaling, when the field is applied
along the axis that separates the Weyl nodes. But, in double and triple WSM,
LMC displays a smooth crossover to a nonlinear $B$-dependence as the field is
tilted away from such a high-symmetry direction. In addition, due to the
enhanced density of states, the LL quantization can trigger instabilities
toward the formation of translational symmetry breaking density-wave orderings
for sufficiently weak interaction (BCS instability), which gaps out the ZLLs.
Concomitantly as the temperature (magnetic field) is gradually decreased
(increased) the LMC becomes negative. Thus WSMs with arbitrary monopole charge
($n$) can host an intriguing interplay of LL quantization, longitudinal
magnetotransport (a possible manifestation of one-dimensional chiral or axial
anomaly), and density-wave ordering, when placed in a strong magnetic field.

scaling as a function of frequency and temperature. Because such power-law
scaling is indicative of a scale-invariant sector, as a first step, we
perturbatively evaluate the electron self-energy due to interactions with
scale-invariant unparticles. We focus on a $G_0W$ type diagram with an
interaction $W$ mediated by a bosonic scalar unparticle. We find that, in the
high-temperature limit, the imaginary part of the self-energy
$\mathrm{Im}\Sigma$ is linear in temperature. In the low-temperature limit,
$\mathrm{Im}\Sigma$ exhibits the same power law in both temperature and
frequency, with an exponent that depends on the scaling dimension of an
unparticle operator. Such behavior is qualitatively consistent with the
experimental observations. We then expand the unparticle propagator into
coherent and incoherent contributions, and study how the incoherent part
violates the density of states (DOS) and density-density correlation function
sum rules (f-sum rule). Such violations can, in principle, be observed
experimentally. Our work indicates that the physical mechanism for the origin
of the power-law scaling is the incoherent background, which is generated from
the Mott-scale physics.

one-dimensional organic compound $\kappa$-H$_3$(Cat-EDT-TTF)$_2$. This compound
can be modeled by the one-band Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular
lattice with $t^\prime/t \simeq 1.5$, where $t'$ is the minority hopping. It
thus becomes important to extend previous studies, that were performed in the
range $0 \leq t'/t \leq 1.2$, to find out whether there is a regime where Mott
insulating behavior can be found without long-range magnetic order. To this
end, we study the above model in the range $1.2 \leq t'/t \leq 2$ using cluster
dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We argue that it is important to choose a
symmetry-preserving cluster rather than a quasi one-dimensional cluster. We
find that, upon increasing $t'/t$ beyond $t^\prime/t \approx 1.3$, the Mott
transition at zero-temperature is replaced by a first-order transition
separating a metallic state from a collinear magnetic insulating state.
Nevertheless, at the physically relevant value $t^\prime/t \simeq 1.5$, the
transitions toward the magnetic and the Mott insulating phases are very close.
The phase diagram obtained in this study can provide a working basis for
moderately one-dimensional compounds on the anisotropic triangular lattice.

precise outcomes, for non-commuting observables such as position and momentum
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle limits the intrinsic precision of a state.
Although theoretical work has demonstrated the possibility to perform
simultaneous non-commuting measurements and has revealed the limits on
measurement outcomes, only recently has the dynamics of the quantum state been
discussed. To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two
continuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables to a
superconducting qubit. We implement multiple readout channels by coupling the
qubit to multiple modes of a cavity. To control the measurement observables, we
implement a 'single quadrature' measurement by driving the qubit and applying
cavity sidebands with a relative phase that sets the observable. Here, we show
that the uncertainty principle governs the dynamics of the wavefunction by
enforcing a lower bound on the measurement-induced disturbance. Consequently,
as we transition from measuring identical to measuring non-commuting
observables, the dynamics make a smooth transition from standard wavefunction
collapse to persistent diffusion. Although the evolution of the state differs
from that of a conventional measurement, information about both observables is
extracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement record,
enabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our work
creates novel capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state
purification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and
continuous quantum error correction. As physical systems often interact
continuously with their environment via non-commuting degrees of freedom, our
work offers a way to study how notions of contemporary quantum foundations
arise in such settings.

modeling and in optimizing the design such that it will exhibit a
linear-elastic response. This is achieved by imposing a single global
constraint on the total sum of equivalent plastic strains, providing accurate
control over all local stress violations. The single constraint essentially
replaces a large number of local stress constraints or an approximate
aggregation of them--two common approaches in the literature. A classical
rate-independent plasticity model is utilized, for which analytical adjoint
sensitivity analysis is derived and verified. Several examples demonstrate the
capability of the computational procedure to generate designs that challenge
results from the literature, in terms of the obtained stiffness-strength-weight
trade-offs. A full elasto-plastic analysis of the optimized designs shows that
prior to the initial yielding, these designs can sustain significantly higher
loads than minimum compliance topological layouts, with only a minor compromise

Myr. Although the uncertainty in the age of the host star is significant, the
spectra and photometry exhibit several indications of youth for HR 2562B. The
source has a position angle consistent with an orbit in the same plane as the
debris disk recently resolved with Herschel. Additionally, it appears to be
interior to the debris disk. Though the extent of the inner hole is currently
too uncertain to place limits on the mass of HR 2562B, future observations of
the disk with higher spatial resolution may be able to provide mass
constraints. This is the first brown dwarf-mass object found to reside in the
inner hole of a debris disk, offering the opportunity to search for evidence of
formation above the deuterium burning limit in a circumstellar disk.

mainly for their ability to capture complex discontinuous behavior, but
inference on the model parameters remains a challenge. Here our goal is
posterior inference on the volatility coefficient of the diffusion part of the
process based on discrete samples. A Bayesian approach requires specification
of a model for the jump part of the process, prior distributions for the
corresponding parameters, and computation of the joint posterior. Since the
volatility coefficient is our only interest, it would be desirable to avoid the
modeling and computational costs associated with the jump part of the process.
Towards this, we consider a {\em purposely misspecified model} that ignores the
jump part entirely. We work out precisely the asymptotic behavior of the
Bayesian posterior under the misspecified model, propose some simple
modifications to correct for the effects of misspecification, and demonstrate
that our modified posterior inference on the volatility is efficient in the
sense that its asymptotic variance equals the no-jumps model Cram\'er--Rao

with the detected attenuation of x-rays. Proponents of the shearlet transform
in the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are
better than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse
for noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In
our reported experiments using simulated CT data collection of the head,
reconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small $\ell_1$-norm are not more
efficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments
for making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization
methodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated
procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy
a primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into
its superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the
primary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but
in addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing)
criterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the $\ell_1$-norm
of the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any
regularizing function that is defined as the $\ell_1$-norm of a transform
specified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature

drawn from a smooth manifold. Scenarios where the data contains multiple
intimate mixtures with some constituent materials in common can be thought of

mapping each mixture-manifold into some low-dimensional euclidean space

for hyperspectral data, particularly in the embedding task. We propose a novel
reconstruction-based algorithm for improved clustering and embedding of
mixture-manifolds. The algorithms attempts to reconstruct each target-point as
an affine combination of its nearest neighbors with an additional rank penalty
on the neighborhood to ensure that only neighbors on the same manifold as the
target-point are used in the reconstruction. The reconstruction matrix
generated by using this technique is block-diagonal and can be used for
clustering (using spectral clustering) and embedding. The improved performance

Tait-Murnaghan equation. Using transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulations we
calculated the elastic modulus of bulk argon as a function of pressure and
argon confined in silica mesopores as a function of Laplace pressure. Our
calculations show that while the elastic modulus is strongly affected by
confinement and temperature, the slope of the modulus versus pressure is not.
Moreover, the calculated slope is in a good agreement with the reference data

We take into account the hierarchical relationships between the distribution of

perform the fitting calculations to the measured extinction curves by applying
a two-component dust model composed of graphite and silicate. As for the size

lognormal distributions. We find that the steep extinction curves derived from
the one-parameter formula by Cardelli et al. (1989) with Rv = 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0

fixed power index of -3.5 with the maximum cut-off radii of a_{max} = 0.13 um,
0.094 um, and 0.057 um, respectively. These maximum cut-off radii are smaller
than a_{max} ~ 0.24 um considered to be valid in the Milky Way, clearly
demonstrating that the interstellar dust responsible for steep extinction
curves is highly biased to smaller sizes. We show that the lognomal size
distribution can also lead to good fits to the extinction curves with Rv =

solving one-dimensional Riemann problem in the direction normal to the cell
interface, the RKDLEG methods are built on genuinely multi-dimensional
approximate local evolution operator of the locally linearized SWEs on a sphere

electron inertia and the Hall drift. This model is used to construct fully
nonlinear Alfv\'enic wave solutions, and thereby derive the kinetic and
magnetic spectra by resorting to a Kolmogorov-like hypothesis based on the
constant cascading rates of the energy and generalized helicities of this
model. The magnetic and kinetic spectra are derived in the ideal $\left(k <
1/\lambda_i\right)$, Hall $\left(1/\lambda_i < k < 1/\lambda_e \right)$, and
electron inertia $\left(k > 1/\lambda_e\right)$ regimes; $k$ is the wavenumber
and $\lambda_s = c/\omega_{p s}$ is the skin depth of species `$s$'. In the
Hall regime, it is shown that the emergent results are fully consistent with
previous numerical and analytical studies, especially in the context of the
solar wind. The focus is primarily on the electron inertia regime, where
magnetic energy spectra with power-law indexes of $-11/3$ and $-13/3$ are
always recovered. The latter, in particular, is quite close to recent
observational evidence from the solar wind with a potential slope of
approximately $-4$ in this regime. It is thus plausible that these spectra may
constitute a part of the (extended) inertial range, as opposed to the standard
`dissipation' range paradigm.

sciences and astrobiology. Analysis of huge planetary data from space missions
such as CoRoT and Kepler is directed ultimately at finding a planet similar to
Earth -- the Earth's twin, and answering the question of potential
exo-habitability. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) is a first step in this
quest, ranging from 1 (Earth) to 0 (totally dissimilar to Earth). It was
defined for the four physical parameters of a planet: radius, density, escape
velocity and surface temperature. The ESI is further sub-divided into interior
ESI (geometrical mean of radius and density) and surface ESI (geometrical mean
of escape velocity and surface temperature). The challenge here is to determine
which exoplanet parameter(s) is important in finding this similarity; how
exactly the individual parameters entering the interior ESI and surface ESI are
contributing to the global ESI. Since the surface temperature entering surface
ESI is a non-observable quantity, it is difficult to determine its value. Using
the known data for the Solar System objects, we established the calibration
relation between surface and equilibrium temperatures to devise an effective
way to estimate the value of the surface temperature of exoplanets for further
analysis with our graphic methodology.
  A new approach, called Mars Similarity Index (MSI), is introduced to identify
planets that may be habitable to the extreme forms of life. MSI is defined in
the range between 1 (present Mars) and 0 (dissimilar to present Mars) and uses
the same physical parameters as ESI. We are interested in Mars-like planets to
search for planets that may host the extreme life forms, such as the ones
living in extreme environments on Earth; for example, methane on Mars may be a
product of the methane-specific extremophile life form metabolism.

and bending vibrations of aromatic hydrocarbon materials, e.g., polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. The 3.3 micrometer aromatic C--H
stretching feature is often accompanied by a weaker feature at 3.4 micrometer.
The latter is often thought to result from the C--H stretch of aliphatic groups
attached to the aromatic systems. The ratio of the observed intensity of the
3.3 micrometer aromatic C--H feature to that of the 3.4 micrometer aliphatic
C--H feature allows one to estimate the aliphatic fraction of the UIE carriers,
provided that the intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 3.3 micrometer aromatic
C--H stretch (A3.3) and the 3.4 micrometer aliphatic C--H stretch (A3.4) are

theory to compute the infrared vibrational spectra of several PAH molecules
with a wide range of sidegroups including ethyl, propyl, butyl, and several
unsaturated alkyl chains, as well as all the isomers of dimethyl-substituted
pyrene. We find that, except PAHs with unsaturated alkyl chains, the

free-flying, predominantly aromatic gas-phase molecules, or amorphous solids
with a mixed aromatic/aliphatic composition are being debated. Recently, the
3.3 and 3.4 micrometer features which are commonly respectively attributed to
aromatic and aliphatic C-H stretches have been used to place an upper limit of
~2\% on the aliphatic fraction of the UIE carriers (i.e. the number of C atoms
in aliphatic chains to that in aromatic rings). Here we further explore the
aliphatic versus aromatic content of the UIE carriers by examining the ratio of
the observed intensity of the 6.2 micrometer aromatic C-C feature (I6.2) to
that of the 6.85 micrometer aliphatic C-H deformation feature (I6.85). To
derive the intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 6.2 micrometer stretch (A6.2)

A6.85/A6.2, we derive the fraction of C atoms in methyl(ene) aliphatic form to
be at most ~10\%, confirming the earlier finding that the UIE emitters are
predominantly aromatic. We have also computed the intrinsic strength of the
7.25 micrometer feature (A7.25), another aliphatic C-H deformation band. We

assume that the emission may originate in processes similar to those observed

this system depends mostly on the magnetic field strength. Jupiter's magnetic
field ($\sim 9$ G on average) allows for radiation from kHz frequencies up to
40 MHz. This is well below the frequency range of VLBI. However, it was
demonstrated that the magnetic field strength in massive and young object may
be up to two orders of magnitude higher than for Jupiter, which is especially
relevant for planets around short-lived A type stars. This should extend the
range of the emission up to GHz frequencies. We calculated expected flux
densities of radio emission for a variety of hypothetical young planetary
systems. We analysed two different emission scenarios, and found that the
radiation induced by moons (process similar to Jupiter-Io interactions) appears
to be less efficient than the emission generated by a stellar wind on a
planetary magnetosphere. We also estimated hypothetical emission of planets and

two-dimensional steady-state shallow water equations (SWEs) with topography and
dry areas.It solves the nonlinear system arising from the well-balanced finite
volume discretization of the steady-state SWEs by using Newton's method as the
outer iteration and a geometric MG method with the block symmetric Gauss-Seidel
smoother as the inner iteration. The proposed Newton MG method makes use of the
local residual to regularize the Jacobian matrix of the Newton iteration, and
can handle the steady-state problem with wet/dry transitions. Several numerical
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and
well-balanced property of the proposed method. The relation between the
convergence behavior of the Newton MG method and the distribution of the
eigenvalues of the iteration matrix is detailedly discussed.

complexity $O(n^{\lceil k/3\rceil})$ for any $k\geq3$, where $n$ is the number

$k$-uniform hypergraph property with sensitivity $O(n^{\lceil k/3\rceil-1/2})$.
This result disproves a conjecture of Babai~\cite{Babai}, which conjectures
that the sensitivity complexity of $k$-uniform hypergraph properties is at
least $\Omega(n^{k/2})$. We also investigate the sensitivity complexity of
other symmetric functions and show that for many classes of transitive Boolean
functions the minimum achievable sensitivity complexity can be $O(N^{1/3})$,

develop a first-order SL, called FOASL, with an abstracted version of the

also show that some reasoning principles involving the points-to predicate can

reasoning about concrete program verification problems. We give some example

the study of geometric frustration of skyrmion crystals in a non-frustrated
artificial geometrical lattice as a consequence of the structural confinement
of skyrmions in magnetic potential wells. The emergent ice rules from the
geometrically frustrated skyrmion crystals highlight a novel phenomenon in this
skyrmion system: emergent geometrical frustration. We demonstrate how skyrmion
crystal topology transitions between a non-frustrated periodic configuration
and a frustrated ice-like ordering can also be realized reversibly. The
proposed artificial frustrated skyrmion systems can be annealed into different
ice phases with an applied current induced spin-transfer torque, including a
long range ordered ice rule obeying ground state, as-relaxed random state,
biased state and monopole state. The spin-torque reconfigurability of the
artificial skyrmion ice states, difficult to achieve in other artificial spin
ice systems, is compatible with standard spintronic device fabrication
technology, which makes the semiconductor industrial integration
straightforward.

problem often include variable selection and dimension reduction procedures.
The novel methodology proposed in this paper combines clustering of variables
and feature selection. More precisely, hierarchical clustering of variables
procedure allows to build groups of correlated variables in order to reduce the
redundancy of information and summarizes each group by a synthetic numerical
variable. Originality is that the groups of variables (and the number of
groups) are unknown a priori. Moreover the clustering approach used can deal
with both numerical and categorical variables (i.e. mixed dataset). Among all
the possible partitions resulting from dendrogram cuts, the most relevant
synthetic variables (i.e. groups of variables) are selected with a variable
selection procedure using random forests. Numerical performances of the
proposed approach are compared with direct applications of random forests and
variable selection using random forests on the original p variables.
Improvements obtained with the proposed methodology are illustrated on two
simulated mixed datasets (cases n>p and n<p, where n is the sample size) and on
a real proteomic dataset. Via the selection of groups of variables (based on
the synthetic variables), interpretability of the results becomes easier.

the best alternative to the perfect codes. In this paper we firstly highlight

present some results. Next, we present a new constructive method for

centralizes the baseband processing capabilities of Base Stations (BSs) in a
cloud computing platform in the form of BaseBand Unit (BBU) pool. In C-RAN,
power consumed by the traditional BS system is distributed as wireless
transmission power of the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) and baseband processing
power of the BBU pool. Different from previous work where wireless transmission
power and baseband processing power are optimized individually and
independently, this paper focuses on joint optimization of allocation for these
two kinds of power and attempts to minimize the total power consumption subject
to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from users in terms of data rates.
First, we exploit the load coupling model to express the coupling relations
among power, load and user data rates. Based on the load coupling mode, we
formulate the joint power optimization problem in C-RAN over both wireless
transmission power and baseband processing power. Second, we prove that
operating at full load may not be optimal in minimizing the total power

compressive strain in the In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$Sb layer enhances the band overlap
and energy gap. Consequently, high bulk resistivity, two orders of magnitude
higher than for InAs/GaSb, is obtained deep in the band-inverted regime. The
strain also enhances bulk Rashba spin-orbit splitting, leading to an unusual
situation where the Fermi level crosses only one spin branch for electronlike
and holelike bands over a wide density range. These properties make this system
a promising platform for robust QSHIs with unique spin properties and

assumption that the driving L\'evy process is locally stable, we extend the
Gaussian framework into a non-Gaussian counterpart, by introducing a novel
quasi-likelihood function formally based on the small-time stable approximation
of the unknown transition density. The resulting estimator turns out to be
asymptotically mixed normally distributed without ergodicity and finite moments
for a wide range of the driving pure-jump L\'evy process, showing much better
theoretical performance compared with the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood

accuracy. The case of large-time asymptotics under ergodicity is briefly
mentioned as well, where we can deduce an analogous asymptotic normality

difficult to realize and its mechanism is still elusive. Several possible
routes to induce topological superconductivity have been proposed, including
proximity efforts, doping or pressurizing a topological insulator or semimetal.
Among them, the pressurizing is considered to be a clean way to tune the
electronic structures. Here we report the discovery of a pressure-induced
topological and superconducting phase of SnSe, a material which is highly
focused recently due to its superior thermoelectric properties. In situ
high-pressure electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction
measurements show that the superconductivity emerges along with the formation
of a CsCl-type structural symmetry of SnSe above around 27 GPa, with a maximum
critical temperature of 3.2 K at 39 GPa. Based on ab initio calculations, this
CsCl-type SnSe is predicted to be a Dirac line nodes (DLN) semimetal in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling, whose DLN states are protected by the
coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These results make
CsCl-type SnSe an interesting model platform with simple crystal symmetry to
study the interplay of topological physics and superconductivity.

with a non zero chance of colliding with the Earth in the future. Some software

However, no single tool is available that combines both aspects and enables a
comprehensive risk analysis. The question is, thus, whether tools that can
calculate impact location may be used to obtain a qualitative understanding of
the asteroid impact risk distribution. To answer this question, two impact risk
distributions that control for impact effect modelling were generated and
compared. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool,
in conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project
the impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m
onto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15% of all objects)
of the hazard list. The resulting 261 impact corridors were visualized on a
global map. Furthermore, the impact corridors were combined with Earth
population data to estimate the simplified risk (without impact effects) and
advanced risk (with impact effects) associated with the direct asteroid impacts
that each nation faces from present to 2100 based on this sample. The
relationship between risk and population size was examined for the 40 most
populous countries and it was apparent that population size is a good proxy for
relative risk. The advanced and simplified risk distributions were compared and
the alteration of the results based on the introduction of physical impact
effects was discussed. Population remained a valid proxy for relative impact
risk, but the inclusion of impact effects resulted in significantly different

course of infectious diseases epidemics in populations and in prospective
evaluation of intervention policies. However, calculating the likelihood for
discretely observed data from even simple models -- such as the ubiquitous
susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model -- has been considered
computationally intractable, since its formulation almost a century ago.
Recently researchers have proposed methods to circumvent this limitation
through data augmentation or approximation, but these approaches often suffer
from high computational cost or loss of accuracy. We develop the mathematical
foundation and an efficient algorithm to compute the likelihood for discretely
observed data from a broad class of stochastic compartmental models. We also
give expressions for the derivatives of the transition probabilities using the
same technique, making possible inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We
use the 17th century plague in Eyam, a classic example of the SIR model, to
compare our recursion method to sequential Monte Carlo, analyze using HMC, and
assess the model assumptions. We also apply our direct likelihood evaluation to
perform Bayesian inference for the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea. The
results suggest that the epidemic infectious rates have decreased since October
2014 in the Southeast region of Guinea, while rates remain the same in other
regions, facilitating understanding of the outbreak and the effectiveness of
Ebola control interventions.

mass and metallicity, stellar rotation has only a marginal effect on these
limits and does not modify the width of the habitable zone. The evolution of
the habitable zone limits is also correlated to the evolution of the stellar
activity (through the Rossby number) that depends on the stellar mass
considered. While the magnetic activity has negligible consequence in the case
of more massive stars, these effects may have a strong impact on the
habitability of a planet around M dwarf stars. Thus, stellar activity cannot be
neglected and may have strong impacts on the development of life during the
early stage of the continuously habitable zone phase of low-mass stars. Using
observed trends of stellar magnetic field strength we also constrain the
planetary magnetic field (at the zero order) required for a sufficient
magnetospheric protection during the whole stellar evolution. We explicit for
the first time the systematic dependence of planet habitability on stellar
parameters along the full evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. These
results can be used as physical inputs for a first order estimation of
exoplanetary habitability.

proposed in [1], our work demonstrate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the
crucial importance of the use of 10B nuclei (in a solution containing also 11B)
for the generation of prompt gamma-rays, which can be applied to medical

the different prompt gamma-rays, as well as of their application as real-time

is reasonable for long time series with at least $10^4$ observations, which can
be easily attainable in some disciplines but problematic in others. The

lattice-dynamical simulations. Our method presents the following convenient
features. The parameters of the model are computed in a very fast and efficient
way, as it is possible to recast the fit to a training set of first-principles
data into a simple matrix diagonalization problem. Our method selects
automatically the interactions that are most relevant to reproduce the
training-set data, by choosing from a pool that includes virtually all possible
coupling terms, and produces a family of models of increasing complexity and
accuracy. We work with practical and convenient cross-validation criteria
linked to the physical properties that will be relevant in future simulations
based on the new model, and which greatly facilitate the task of identifying a
potential that is simultaneously simple (thus computationally light), very
accurate, and predictive. We also discuss practical ways to guarantee that our
energy models are bounded from below, with a minimal impact on their accuracy.
Finally, we demonstrate our scheme with an application to ferroelastic
perovskite SrTiO$_{3}$, which features many non-trivial lattice-dynamical
features (e.g., a phase transition driven by soft phonons, competing structural
instabilities, highly anharmonic dynamics) and provides a very demanding test.

  Semantic Composition","To appear at EMNLP 2016",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributional models are derived from co-occurrences in a corpus, where only
a small proportion of all possible plausible co-occurrences will be observed.
This results in a very sparse vector space, requiring a mechanism for inferring
missing knowledge. Most methods face this challenge in ways that render the
resulting word representations uninterpretable, with the consequence that
semantic composition becomes hard to model. In this paper we explore an
alternative which involves explicitly inferring unobserved co-occurrences using
the distributional neighbourhood. We show that distributional inference
improves sparse word representations on several word similarity benchmarks and
demonstrate that our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art for
adjective-noun, noun-noun and verb-object compositions while being fully
interpretable.

implemented in situations that allow obtaining a large amount of data over a

sources. Characteristic to such a tomography scenario is that it necessitates
the inversion technique to be genuinely three-dimensional: For example, slicing
is not possible due to the low number of sources. Here, we primarily focused on
astrophysical subsurface exploration purposes. As an example target of our
numerical experiments we used a synthetic small planetary object containing
three inclusions, e.g. voids, of the size of the wavelength. A tetrahedral
arrangement of source positions was used, it being the simplest symmetric point
configuration in 3D. Our results suggest that somewhat reliable inversion
results can be produced within the present a priori assumptions, if the data
can be recorded at a specific resolution. This is valuable early-stage
knowledge especially for design of future planetary missions in which the
payload needs to be minimized, and potentially also for the development of
other lightweight subsurface inspection systems.

with photometric or spectroscopic information, as taken from the literature. We
pay attention to perform homogeneous procedures to select cluster members,
compute global cluster properties, in particular the LOS velocity dispersion
sigmaV, and separate blue from red galaxies. We find evidence of VCS in
clusters out to z~0.8 (at the 97%-99.99% c.l., depending on the test), in the
sense that the blue galaxy population has a 10-20% larger sigmaV than the red
galaxy population. Poor or no VCS is found in the High-z sample at z>=0.8. For
the first time, we detect VLS in non-local clusters and confirm that VLS only
affects the very luminous galaxies, with brighter galaxies having lower
velocities. The threshold magnitude of VLS is ~m3+0.5, where m3 is the
magnitude of the third brightest cluster galaxy, and current data suggest that
the threshold value moves to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. We also
detect (marginal) evidence of VLS for blue galaxies. We conclude that the
segregation effects, when their study is extended to distant clusters, can be
important tracers of the galaxy evolution and cluster assembly and discuss the

due to its connection to game theory. Stable graphs are exactly the graphs
inducing a matching game with non-empty core. They are also the graphs that
induce a network bargaining game with a balanced solution. A graph with
weighted edges is called stable if the maximum weight of an integral matching
equals the cost of a minimum fractional weighted vertex cover. If a graph is
not stable, it can be stabilized in different ways. Recent papers have
considered the deletion or addition of edges and vertices in order to stabilize
a graph. In this work, we focus on a fine-grained stabilization strategy,
namely stabilization of graphs by fractionally increasing edge weights. We show
the following results for stabilization by minimum weight increase in edge
weights (min additive stabilizer): (i) Any approximation algorithm for min
additive stabilizer that achieves a factor of $O(|V|^{1/24-\epsilon})$ for
$\epsilon>0$ would lead to improvements in the approximability of
densest-$k$-subgraph. (ii) Min additive stabilizer has no $o(\log{|V|})$

super-constant hardness results for any graph stabilization problem. On the
algorithmic side, we present (iii) an algorithm to solve min additive
stabilizer in factor-critical graphs exactly in poly-time, (iv) an algorithm to
solve min additive stabilizer in arbitrary-graphs exactly in time exponential
in the size of the Tutte set, and (v) a poly-time algorithm with approximation

samples generated via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or related algorithms. In
this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of how to make and evaluate
probabilistic forecasts from such simulation output. Based on proper scoring
rules, we develop a notion of consistency that allows to assess the adequacy of
methods for estimating the stationary distribution underlying the simulation
output. We then provide asymptotic results that account for the salient
features of Bayesian posterior simulators, and derive conditions under which
choices from the literature satisfy our notion of consistency. Importantly,
these conditions depend on the scoring rule being used, such that the choices
of approximation method and scoring rule are intertwined. While the logarithmic
rule requires fairly stringent conditions, the continuous ranked probability
score (CRPS) yields consistent approximations under minimal assumptions. These
results are illustrated in a simulation study and an economic data example.
Overall, mixture-of-parameters approximations which exploit the parametric
structure of Bayesian models perform particularly well. Under the CRPS, the
empirical distribution function is a simple and appealing alternative option.

find that, for values of the Hubbard interaction $U$ above a critical value
$U_C$, the system displays a superposition of local ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic ordered states. Nonetheless the global ferromagnetic order
parameter is zero. The $U_C$ depends only on the product of the period and

antiferromagnetic order parameter becomes much larger than the ferromagnetic

in the presence of interference; that is, when one individual's treatment
assignment affects another individual's outcomes. Our motivating example is a
two-stage randomized trial evaluating an intervention to reduce student
absenteeism in the School District of Philadelphia. In that experiment,
households with multiple students were first assigned to treatment or control;
then, in treated households, one student was randomly assigned to treatment.
Using this example, we highlight key considerations for analyzing two-stage
experiments in practice. Our first contribution is to address additional
complexities that arise when household sizes vary; in this case, researchers
must decide between assigning equal weight to households or equal weight to
individuals. We propose unbiased estimators for a broad class of individual-
and household-weighted estimands, with corresponding theoretical and estimated
variances. Our second contribution is to connect two common approaches for
analyzing two-stage designs: linear regression and randomization inference. We
show that, with suitably chosen standard errors, these two approaches yield
identical point and variance estimates, which is somewhat surprising given the
complex randomization scheme. Finally, we explore options for incorporating
covariates to improve precision. We confirm our analytic results via simulation

vibrating ring capable of producing ultrasonic standing and traveling waves,
creating the acoustic excitation that affects the pressure in a thin,
intermediate layer of gas. A distinctive vibration pattern is required to
generate the temporal and spatial pressure field of the squeezed air layer that
gives rise to both acoustic levitation force and rotational torque. Described

structure, all followed by verifying and dynamics-calibration experiments.
Moreover, by precisely controlling the ratio of standing and traveling waves in
a closed-loop, one can affect the shear forces applied by the squeezed air
layer, thus creating a non-contacting manipulation mechanism. An over-actuated
set-up is converted via an algebraic transformation, into a simplified single
control-parameter problem. The transformation ties the standing waves ratio,

evolution of Proxima b's water inventory. We use our spectral energy
distribution to compute the hydrogen loss from the planet with an improved
energy-limited escape formalism. Despite the high level of stellar activity we
find that Proxima b is likely to have lost less than an Earth ocean's worth of
hydrogen before it reached the HZ 100-200 Myr after its formation. The largest
uncertainty in our work is the initial water budget, which is not constrained
by planet formation models. We conclude that Proxima b is a viable candidate
habitable planet.

challenging compared to traditional resource allocation settings due to the
presence of \emph{complex network externalities} -- changes in the
demand/supply at any location affect future supply throughout the system within
short timescales. These externalities are well captured by steady-state
Markovian models, which are therefore widely used to analyze such systems.
However, using such models to design pricing and other control policies is
computationally difficult since the resulting optimization problems are
high-dimensional and non-convex.
  To this end, we develop a \emph{rigorous approximation framework} for shared
vehicle systems, providing a unified approach for a wide range of controls
(pricing, matching, rebalancing), objective functions (throughput, revenue,
welfare), and system constraints (travel-times, welfare benchmarks,
posted-price constraints). Our approach is based on the analysis of natural
convex relaxations, and obtains as special cases existing approximate-optimal
policies for limited settings, asymptotic-optimality results, and heuristic
policies. The resulting guarantees are non-asymptotic and parametric, and
provide operational insights into the design of real-world systems. In
particular, for any shared vehicle system with $n$ stations and $m$ vehicles,
our framework obtains an approximation ratio of $1+(n-1)/m$, which is
particularly meaningful when $m/n$, the average number of vehicles per station,
is large, as is often the case in practice.

particle model and it was shown to be associated with a high order continuum
characterized by independent rotation and displacement fields. Furthermore, the
HOM model possesses two characteristic lengths: the first associated with the
spacing of flaws in the material internal structure and related to the gradient
character of the continuum; and the second associated with the size of these
flaws and related to the micro-polar character of the continuum. The
displacement-based finite element implementation of this type of continua
requires $C^1$ continuity both within the elements and at the element
boundaries. This motivated the implementation of the concept of isogeometric
analysis which ensures a higher degree of smoothness and continuity. NURBS
based isogeometric elements were implemented in a 3D setting, with both
displacement and rotational degrees of freedom at each control point. The
performed numerical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HOM
model implementation to ensure optimal convergence in both elastic and

formulation of a localization limiter able to prevent strain localization and
spurious mesh sensitivity known to be pathological issues for typical local

to the sensors on Landsats 4-7 with respect to radiometric calibration, signal

spectral response functions on the OLI have resulted in known biases for
commonly used spectral indices because the new band responses integrate
absorption features differently from previous Landsat sensors. The objective of
this analysis is to quantify the impact of these changes on linear spectral
mixture models that use imagery collected by different Landsat sensors. The
2013 underflight of Landsat 7 and 8 provides an opportunity to cross calibrate
the spectral mixing spaces of the ETM+ and OLI sensors using near-simultaneous
acquisitions from a wide variety of land cover types worldwide. We use
80,910,343 pairs of OLI and ETM+ spectra to characterize the OLI spectral
mixing space and perform a cross-calibration with ETM+. This new global
collection of Landsat spectra spans a greater spectral diversity than those
used in prior studies and the resulting Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD)
spectral endmembers (EMs) supplant prior global Landsat EMs. We find only minor
(-0.01 < u < 0.01) differences between SVD fractions unmixed using
sensor-specific EMs. RMS misfit fractions are also small (<98% of pixels with
<5% RMSE), in accord with past studies. Finally, vegetation is used as an
example to illustrate the empirical and theoretical relationship between
commonly used spectral indices and subpixel fractions. SVD fractions unmixed
using global EMs thus provide easily computable, linearly scalable, physically

planet Proxima~b could have retained enough volatiles to sustain surface
habitability \citep{Ribas2016}. Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model (GCM) to
simulate Proxima b's atmosphere and water cycle for its two likely rotation
modes (1:1 and 3:2 spin-orbit resonances) while varying the unconstrained
surface water inventory and atmospheric greenhouse effect. We find that a broad
range of atmospheric compositions allow surface liquid water. On a
tidally-locked planet with sufficient surface water inventory, liquid water is
always present, at least in the substellar region. With a non-synchronous
rotation, this requires a minimum greenhouse warming ($\sim$10~mbar of CO$_2$
and 1~bar of N$_2$). If the planet is dryer, $\sim$0.5~bar/1.5~bars of CO$_2$
(respectively for asynchronous/synchronous rotation) suffice to prevent the
trapping of any arbitrary small water inventory into polar/nightside ice caps.
We produce reflection/emission spectra and phase curves for the simulated
climates. We find that atmospheric characterization will be possible by direct
imaging with forthcoming large telescopes. The angular separation of $7
\lambda/D$ at 1~$\mu$m (with the E-ELT) and a contrast of $\sim$10$^{-7}$ will
enable high-resolution spectroscopy and the search for molecular signatures,
including H$_2$O, O$_2$, and CO$_2$. The observation of thermal phase curves
can be attempted with JWST, thanks to a contrast of $2\times10^{-5}$ at
10~$\mu$m. Proxima~b will also be an exceptional target for future IR
interferometers. Within a decade it will be possible to image Proxima~b and
possibly determine whether this exoplanet's surface is habitable.

19.96+3.08-3.61 MEarth and an orbital period of ~34 days in the gap between
Kepler-20f (P ~ 11 days) and Kepler-20d (P ~ 78 days).

have the lowest metallicities. As most dwarf galaxies are in group
environments, interaction effects such as tides could contribute to this trend.
We perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of
dwarf galaxies in external tidal fields to examine the effects of tides on
their metallicities and metallicity gradients. In our simulated galaxies,
gravitational instabilities drive gas inwards and produce centralized star
formation and a significant metallicity gradient. Strong tides can contribute
to these instabilities, but their primary effect is to strip the outer
low-metallicity gas, producing a truncated gas disk with a large metallicity.
This suggests that the role of tides on the mass-metallicity relation is to
move dwarf galaxies to higher metallicities.

remarkably, that the MF optimal external fields (i.e., the external fields

mining for several years. With the rapid development of the geospatial
information technologies, the size of spatial information data is growing
exponentially which makes clustering massive spatial data a challenging task.
In order to improve the efficiency of spatial clustering for large scale data,
many researchers proposed several efficient clustering algorithms in parallel.
In this paper, a new K-Medoids++ spatial clustering algorithm based on
MapReduce for clustering massive spatial data is proposed. The initialization
algorithm to decrease the number of iterations is combined with the MapReduce
framework. Comparative Experiments conducted over different dataset and
different number of nodes indicate that the proposed K-Medoids spatial
clustering algorithm provides better efficiency than traditional K-Medoids and
scales well while processing massive spatial data on commodity hardware.

social network. We propose a method for network vertex search that looks for
the target vertex by sequentially examining the neighbors of a set of ""known""
vertices to which the target vertex may have connected. The objective is to
find the target vertex as quickly as possible from amongst the neighbors of the
known vertices. We model this type of search as successively drawing marbles
from a set of urns, where each urn represents one of the known vertices and the
marbles in each urn represent the respective vertex's neighbors. Using a
dynamic programming approach, we analyze this model and show that there is
always an optimal ""block"" policy, in which all of the neighbors of a known
vertex are examined before moving on to another vertex. Surprisingly, this
block policy result holds for arbitrary dependencies in the connection
probabilities of the target vertex and known vertices. Furthermore, we give
precise characterizations of the optimal block policy in two specific cases:
(1) when the connections between the known vertices and the target vertex are
independent, and (2) when the target vertex is connected to at most one known
vertex. Finally, we provide some general monotonicity properties and discuss
the relevance of our findings in social media and other applications.

fundamental theory of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has
gained attention in this regard due to its theoretically strong framework.
However, it faces some limitations such as current state dependence,
computationally expensive and inability to be applied to real brain data. On
the other hand, Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) is a clinical measure for
distinguishing different levels of consciousness. Though PCI claims to capture
the functional differentiation and integration in brain networks (similar to
IIT), its link to integrated information theories is rather weak. Inspired by
these two approaches, we propose a new measure - $\Phi^C$ using a novel
compression-complexity perspective that serves as a bridge between the two, for
the first time. $\Phi^C$ is founded on the principles of lossless data
compression based complexity measures which characterize the dynamical
complexity of brain networks. $\Phi^{C}$ exhibits following salient
innovations: (i) mathematically well bounded, (ii) negligible current state
dependence unlike $\Phi$, (iii) integrated information measured as
compression-complexity rather than as an infotheoretic quantity, and (iv)
faster to compute since number of atomic bipartitions scales linearly with the
number of nodes of the network, thus avoiding combinatorial explosion. Our
computer simulations show that $\Phi^C$ has similar hierarchy to $<\Phi>$ for
several multiple-node networks and it demonstrates a rich interplay between
differentiation, integration and entropy of the nodes of a network. $\Phi^C$ is
a promising heuristic measure to characterize the quantity of integrated
information (and hence a measure of quantity of consciousness) in larger
networks like human brain and provides an opportunity to test the predictions
of brain complexity on real neural data.

the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and Wilson loops to name a few. However, the
pedagogical examples and research work almost exclusively focus on situations
where the fields are time-independent so that one need only deal with purely
spatial line integrals ({\it e.g.} $\oint {\bf A} \cdot d{\bf x}$) and purely
spatial area integrals ({\it e.g.} $\int (\nabla \times {\bf A}) \cdot d{\bf a}
= \int {\bf B} \cdot d{\bf a}$). Here we address this gap by giving some
explicit examples of how Stokes' theorem plays out with time-dependent fields
in a full 4-dimensional spacetime context. We also discuss some unusual
features of Stokes' theorem with time-dependent fields related to gauge
transformations and non-simply connected topology.

into the states of the ""generalized Landau problem"" (a charged quantum particle
moving inside a magnetic, and possibly electric field), and motivated by an
early article that correctly warns against a naive use of gauge transformation
procedures in the usual Landau problem (i.e. with the magnetic field being
static and uniform), we first show how to bypass the complications pointed out
in that article by solving the problem in full generality through gauge
transformation techniques in a more appropriate manner. Our solution provides
in simple and closed analytical forms all Landau Level-wavefunctions without
the need to specify a particular vector potential. This we do by proper
handling of the so-called pseudomomentum K (or of a quantity that we term
pseudoangular momentum Lz), a method that is crucially different from the old
warning argument, but also from standard treatments in textbooks and in
research literature (where the usual Landau wavefunctions are employed -
labeled with canonical momenta quantum numbers). Most importantly, we go
further by showing that a similar procedure can be followed in the more
difficult case of spatially-nonuniform magnetic fields: in such case we define
K and Lz as plausible generalizations of the previous ordinary case, namely as
appropriate line integrals of the inhomogeneous magnetic field - our method
providing closed analytical expressions for all stationary state
wavefunctions.. (see paper) ... also provide explicit Berry's phase
calculations and their connection to probability currents and ...issues in
elementary Quantum Mechanics and Condensed Matter Physics. As an added feature,
we also show how the possible presence of an additional electric field can be
treated through a further generalization of pseudomomenta and their proper
handling.
