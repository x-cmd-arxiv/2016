building on the observation that WSOL algorithms usually work better on images
with bigger objects. Instead of training the object detector on the entire
training set at the same time, we propose a curriculum learning strategy to
feed training images into the WSOL learning loop in an order from images
containing bigger objects down to smaller ones. To automatically determine the
order, we train a regressor to estimate the size of the object given the whole
image as input. Furthermore, we use these size estimates to further improve the
re-localization step of WSOL by assigning weights to object proposals according
to how close their size matches the estimated object size. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of using size order and size weighting on the challenging PASCAL
VOC 2007 dataset, where we achieve a significant improvement over existing
state-of-the-art WSOL techniques.

addition, contrary to the common perception that only transition metal ions may
response to the charge transfer process, we found that charge is also actively
compensated by rare-earth and alkaline-earth metal ions of the interface. Such
deterministic control of $T_c$ by pure electronic doping without any hindering

Assuming slow chemical equilibration of quarks, the spectra and elliptic flows
of thermal dileptons and photons are calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at
the LHC energy of $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV. It is shown that a
suppression of quarks at early times leads to a significant reduction of the

$p_T$-distribution of direct photons. It is demonstrated that an enhancement of
photon and dilepton elliptic flows might serve as a promising signature of the
pure-glue initial state. Calculations based on Bjorken hydrodynamics suggest
that collisions of small systems at intermediate energies available at RHIC or

distances $ \ll 1/m$, with the Coulomb field of atomic nucleus is considered by
taking into account the complete dependence of electron's wavefunction (WF) on

$\Delta U_{AMM}$ via both the quark structure and the whole nucleus, considered
as a uniformly charged extended Coulomb source, leads to results, which
coincide within the accepted precision of calculations. It is shown also that
there appears some difference in results between perturbative and

Moreover, the growth rate of the contribution from $\Delta U_{AMM}$ reaches its
maximum at $ Z \sim 140-150$, while by further increase of $Z$ into the
supercritical region $Z\gg Z_{cr,1}$ the shift of levels caused by $\Delta

challenging problem. The majority of automated approaches have focused on
customizing and inferring dose volume objectives to used in plan optimization.
In this work we outline a multi-patient atlas-based dose prediction approach
that learns to predict the dose-per-voxel for a novel patient directly from the
computed tomography (CT) planning scan without the requirement of specifying
any objectives. Our method learns to automatically select the most effective
atlases for a novel patient, and then map the dose from those atlases onto the
novel patient. We extend our previous work to include a conditional random
field for the optimization of a joint distribution prior that matches the
complementary goals of an accurately spatially distributed dose distribution
while still adhering to the desired dose volume histograms. The resulting
distribution can then be used for inverse-planning with a new spatial dose
objective, or to create typical dose volume objectives for the canonical
optimization pipeline. We investigated six treatment sites (633 patients for
training and 113 patients for testing) and evaluated the mean absolute
difference (MAD) in all DVHs for the clinical and predicted dose distribution.
The results on average are favorable in comparison to our previous approach
(1.91 vs 2.57). Comparing our method with and without atlas-selection further
validates that atlas-selection improved dose prediction on average in Whole
Breast (0.64 vs 1.59), Prostate (2.13 vs 4.07), and Rectum (1.46 vs 3.29) while
it is less important in Breast Cavity (0.79 vs 0.92) and Lung (1.33 vs 1.27)

atlas-selection has the potential to be impactful (3.65 vs 5.09), but selecting

particles with UrQMD predictions, a value \gamma = 0.72 \pm 0.19 is obtained

new and more stringent constraint for the regime of supra-saturation density
and confirms, with a considerably smaller uncertainty, the moderately soft to
linear density dependence deduced from the earlier FOPI-LAND data. The

in most eukaryotic cells, with perturbations in active transport resulting in
several types of disease. Efficient delivery of critical cargos to specific
locations is accomplished through a combination of passive diffusion and active
transport by molecular motors that ballistically move along a network of
cytoskeletal filaments. Although motor-based transport is known to be necessary
to overcome cytoplasmic crowding and the limited range of diffusion within
reasonable time scales, the topological features of the cytoskeletal network
that regulate transport efficiency and robustness have not been established.
Using a continuum diffusion model, we observed that the time required for
cellular transport was minimized when the network was localized near the
nucleus. In simulations that explicitly incorporated network spatial
architectures, total filament mass was the primary driver of network transit
times. However, filament traps that redirect cargo back to the nucleus caused
large variations in network transport. Filament polarity was more important
than filament orientation in reducing average transit times, and transport
properties were optimized in networks with intermediate motor on and off rates.
Our results provide important insights into the functional constraints on
intracellular transport under which cells have evolved cytoskeletal structures,
and have potential applications for enhancing reactions in biomimetic systems

on the system-level material response that use DD-generated information to
enhance the fidelity of plasticity models. To ascertain to what degree the
predictions of CP are consistent with those of DD, we compare their global and
microstructural response in a number of deformation modes. After using
nominally homogeneous compression and shear deformation dislocation dynamics
simulations to calibrate crystal plasticity flow rule parameters, we compare
not only the system-level stress-strain response of prismatic wires in torsion

establish a connection between explicit description of dislocations and the

length-scale at which meaningful dislocation density fields appear. Our results
show that, for the case of torsion, the two material models can produce

invoke assumptions such as the strong ignorability of sample selection that are

the point estimate based inferences, this article considers inferences on
partially identified estimates from fewer and weaker assumptions. We extend
partial identification methods to causal generalization with nonrandom samples
by using a cluster randomized trial in education. Bounds on the population
average treatment effect are derived under four cases, two under no assumptions
on the data, and two that assume bounded sample variation and monotonicity of
response. This approach is amenable to incorporating population data frames to
tighten bounds on the population average treatment effect. Under the
assumptions of bounded sample variation and monotonicity, the interval
estimates of the average treatment effect provide sufficiently informative
bounds to rule out large treatment effects, which are consistent with the point
estimates from the experimental study. This illustrates that partial

generalization in the absence of strong ignorability of sample selection.

Recently, it is proved that such a quantum protocol does not exist if the two
input states are completely unknown, whereas a probabilistic protocol is still
available with some prior knowledge about the input states [M. Oszmaniec
\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 110403 (2016)]. The knowledge is that both
of the two input states have nonzero overlaps with some given referential
state. In this work, we experimentally realize the probabilistic protocol of
superposing two pure states in a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system.
We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by preparing a families of input
states, and the average fidelity between the prepared state and expected
superposition state is over 99%. Moreover, we experimentally illustrate the
limitation of the protocol that it is likely to fail or yields very low
fidelity, if the nonzero overlaps are approaching zero. Our experimental
implementation can be extended to more complex situations and other quantum

detection of the signal associated with the DM annihilation or decay in the
background intensity spectrum. The DM imprint on the $\gamma$-ray background is
expected to be correlated with large-scale structure tracers. In some cases,
such a cross-correlation is even expected to have a higher signal-to-noise
ratio than the auto-correlation. One reliable tracer of the DM distribution in
the large-scale structure is lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB),
and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is a reliable tracer of SFGs. We

limits on the DM annihilation cross-section from the cross-power spectra with
the $\gamma$-ray background anisotropies. The unbiased power spectrum
estimation is validated with simulations that include cross-correlated signals.
We also provide a set of systematic tests and show that no significant

controlling many physical aspects of plastic deformation. We present results of
3D dislocation dynamics simulations that shed light on the mechanisms of their
formation, motion, interactions, and large-scale patterning. We identify two
main formation mechanisms, enabled by cross-slip, and show that arrays of
dipoles can be easily formed as a result of the interaction between glide screw
dislocations. We present a systematic analysis of the spectrum of possible
junctions that can form as a result of mutual interaction between dipoles, and
between dipoles and glide dislocations. We show that fully immobile dislocation
segments arise in particular cases of these interactions, leading to hardening
and Frank-Read type sources. We reveal that the collective motion of dipolar
loop arrays can be induced by glide dislocations in the channels of Persistent
Slip Bands (PSB), and result in their clustering within PSB channel walls. An
efficient tripolar drag mechanism is found to contribute to the clustering of
dipolar loops near channel walls.

250-$\mu$m, and Herschel 250-$\mu$m spatially filtered to mimic the SCUBA-2
data. SCUBA-2 detects only the highest-surface-brightness sources, principally
detecting protostellar sources and starless cores embedded in filaments, while
Herschel is sensitive to most of the cloud structure, including extended
low-surface-brightness emission. Herschel detects considerably more sources
than SCUBA-2 even after spatial filtering. We investigate which properties of a
starless core detected by Herschel determine its detectability by SCUBA-2, and
find that they are the core's temperature and column density (for given dust
properties). For similar-temperature cores, such as those seen in L1495, the
surface brightnesses of the cores are determined by their column densities,
with the highest-column-density cores being detected by SCUBA-2. For roughly
spherical geometries, column density corresponds to volume density, and so
SCUBA-2 selects the densest cores from a population at a given temperature.
This selection effect, which we quantify as a function of distance, makes
SCUBA-2 ideal for identifying those cores in Herschel catalogues that are
closest to forming stars. Our results can now be used by anyone wishing to use

revive GUT baryogenesis, proposed by Fukugita and Yanagida, where right-handed

significantly wash out the original $B+L$ asymmetry, and in this way one can
prevent a total washout of the initial baryon asymmetry. By solving the

very well and can transform a significant fraction of the cluster population

temperature can be calculated in two different perturbative regimes: for small
values of the baryon chemical potential $\mu$, one may use chiral perturbation
theory (ChEFT); and for large values of $\mu$, one may use perturbative QCD
(pQCD). There is, however, a gap for $\mu \in (0.97\text{ GeV},\, 2.6\text{
GeV})$, where these theories becomes non-perturbative, and where there is
currently no known microscopic description of QCD matter. Unfortunately, this
interval obscures the values of $\mu$ found within the cores of neutron stars
(NSs).
  In this thesis, we argue that thermodynamic matching of the ChEFT and pQCD
EoSs is a legitimate way to obtain quantitative constraints on the
non-pertubative QCD EoS. Moreover, we argue that this method is effective,
verifiable, and systematically improvable. First, we carry out a simplified
matching procedure in QCD-like theories that can be simulated on the lattice
without a sign problem. Our calculated pressure band serves as a prediction for
lattice-QCD practitioners and will allow them to verify or refute the
simplified procedure. Second, we apply the state-of-the-art matched EoS of
Kurkela et al. (2014) to rotating NSs. This allows us to obtain bounds on
observable NS properties, as well as point towards future observations that
would more tightly constrain the current state-of-the-art EoS band. Finally, as
evidence of the ability to improve the procedure, we carry out calculations in
pQCD to improve the zero-temperature pressure. We calculate the full
$\mathcal{O}(g^{6} \ln^{2} g)$ contribution to the pQCD pressure for $n_{f}$

cross-correlations between the signals from each antenna pair. Digital
correlators have systematic errors due to the quantization losses. The
correlation errors allow substantial abatement based on the assumption that the
analog signals are stochastic processes sampled from a statistical distribution
(usually the Gaussian). The correlation correction technique is named after Van
Vleck who was the first to apply it to two-level clipping quantizers. The
correction is especially important for high correlation levels, e.g. in studies
of solar radio emissions. We offer a generalized method that for every antenna
pair inputs the quantized signals' covariance and standard deviations, and
outputs high-precision estimates of the analog correlation. Although
correlation correction methods have been extensively investigated in the past,
there are several problems that, as far as we know, have not been published
yet. We consider a very general quantization scheme with arbitrary set of
transition thresholds and output levels, and our correction method is designed
for correlations obtained from signals with generally unequal standard
deviations. We also provide a method for estimation of the analog standard
deviation from the quantized one for subsequent use in the correlation
correction. We apply the correction to the the complex-valued analytic signals,
overwhelmingly used in modern remote sensing systems with arrays of antennas.
The approach is valid not only for analytic signals with the imaginary part
being the Hilbert transform of the real one, but also for more general,
circularly symmetric complex processes whose real and imaginary parts may have
arbitrary relationships to each other. This work was motivated by the need for
greater precision in analysis of data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

means of exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions of the Kubo formula in large

behavior with a clear transition around non-zero Fermi energy, \mu~\mu*. In the
vicinity of the Dirac point, the imaginary part of optical conductivity is
negative for low frequencies while the real part is strongly suppressed. On the

coronal magnetic reconnection, small scale, high speed jets form. The familiar
vortex quadrupoles form at reconnection sites. Between the magnetic footpoints

excitations as well as single molecule stretches and bends have been measured
by different kinds of experiments such as OHD-RIKES and terahertz spectroscopy.
In the present work we investigate the intermolecular vibrational spectrum of
DMSO through three different computational techniques namely (i) the far-infra
red spectrum obtained through Fourier transform of total dipole moment auto
time correlation function, (ii) from Fourier transform of the translational and
angular velocity time autocorrelation functions and a (iii) quenched normal
mode analysis of the parent liquid at 300K. The three spectrum, although
exhibit differences among each other, reveal similar features which are in
good, semi-quantitative, agreement with experimental results. Study of
participation ratio of the density of states obtained from normal mode analysis
shows that the broad spectrum around 100 cm-1 involves collective oscillations
of 300-400 molecules. Dipolar solvation dynamics exhibit ultrafast energy
relaxation (dipolar solvation dynamics) with initial time correlation function
around 140 fs which can be attributed to the coupling to the collective
excitations. We compare properties of DMSO with those of water vis-a-vis the
existence of the low frequency collective modes. Lastly, we find that the
collective excitation spectrum exhibits strong temperature dependence.

gas, placing these in context of semi-analytic models. Our selection criteria
lead us to focus on Milky Way-like haloes. We find the hot-gas density profiles
of the haloes form a progressively stronger core over time, the nature of which
can be captured by a beta profile that has a simple dependence on redshift. In
contrast, the hot gas that will cool over a time-step is broadly consistent
with a singular isothermal sphere. We find that cooling gas carries a few times
the specific angular momentum of the halo and is offset in spin direction from
the rest of the hot gas. The gas loses ~60% of its specific angular momentum
during the cooling process, generally remaining greater than that of the halo,
and it precesses to become aligned with the cold gas already in the disc. We
find tentative evidence that angular-momentum losses are slightly larger when
gas cools onto dispersion-supported galaxies. We show that an exponential
surface density profile for gas arriving on a disc remains a reasonable
approximation, but a cusp containing ~20% of the mass is always present, and
disc scale radii are larger than predicted by a vanilla Fall & Efstathiou
model. These scale radii are still closely correlated with the halo spin
parameter, for which we suggest an updated prescription for galaxy formation
models.

between two-loop graphs at all weights, and between higher-loop graphs of
weights four and five were constructed. In the present paper, these results are
generalized in two complementary directions. First, all identities at weight
six and all dihedral identities at weight seven are obtained and proven.
Whenever the Laurent polynomial at the cusp is available, the form of these

polynomial governs the full modular identity. Second, the family of modular
graph functions is extended to include all graphs with derivative couplings and
worldsheet fermions. These extended families of modular graph functions are
shown to obey a hierarchy of inhomogeneous Laplace eigenvalue equations. The
eigenvalues for the extended family of dihedral modular graph functions are
calculated analytically for the simplest infinite sub-families and obtained by
Maple for successively more complicated sub-families. The spectrum is shown to

Nonetheless, no experimental demonstration of optimal cloning machines has

surface. Recent measurements that combine rotational tomography, extreme
ultraviolet imaging, and potential-field extrapolation have shown the existence
of large loops with inverted temperature profiles; i.e., loops for which the
apex temperature is a local minimum, not a maximum. These ""down loops"" appear
to exist primarily in equatorial quiet regions near solar minimum. We simulate
both these and the more prevalent large-scale ""up loops"" by modeling coronal
heating as a time-steady superposition of: (1) dissipation of incompressible
Alfven-wave turbulence, and (2) dissipation of compressive waves formed by mode
conversion from the initial population of Alfven waves. We found that when a
large percentage (> 99%) of the Alfven waves undergo this conversion, heating
is greatly concentrated at the footpoints and stable ""down loops"" are created.
In some cases we found loops with three maxima that are also gravitationally
stable. Models that agree with the tomographic temperature data exhibit higher
gas pressures for ""down loops"" than for ""up loops,"" which is consistent with
observations. These models also show a narrow range of Alfven wave amplitudes:
3 to 6 km/s at the coronal base. This is low in comparison to typical observed
amplitudes of 20 to 30 km/s in bright X-ray loops. However, the large-scale
loops we model are believed to comprise a weaker diffuse background that fills
much of the volume of the corona. By constraining the physics of loops that
underlie quiescent streamers, we hope to better understand the formation of the
slow solar wind.

presence of subdominant gradient energies, suggesting that it is much less
robust to inhomogeneities than large field inflation, which withstands dominant
gradient energies. However, we also show that small field inflation can be
successful even if some regions of spacetime start out in the region of the

previous results that inflation is robust if the inflaton occupies the

black holes if the initial hypersurface is approximately flat. Finally, we
consider the large field case with a varying extrinsic curvature K, such that

enhancement of T_c may be due to excess electron transfer to BiS_2 from the
Mn4+/Mn3+-substitutions in Bi_2O_2. This notion is empirically corroborated by
the increased electron-carrier densities upon Mn doping, and by further studies
of the Bi_4-x A_x O_4 S_3 compounds (A = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125), where the T_c
values remain comparable to that of the undoped Bi_4O_4S_3 system (= 4.5 K) due
to lack of 4+ valences in either Co or Ni ions for excess electron transfer to
the BiS_2 layers. These findings therefore shed new light on feasible pathways
to enhance the T_c values of BiS_2-based superconductors.

maintained service demarcation boundaries between their routing and signaling

entity and therefore limiting any meaningful interaction between the VSP and
the VPNs. A key challenge is to expose each VPN to information about available
network resources through an abstraction (TA) [1] which is both accurate and
fair. In [2] we proposed three decentralized schemes assuming that all the
border nodes performing the abstraction have access to the entire core network
topology. This assumption likely leads to over- or under-subscription. In this
paper we develop centralized schemes to partition the core network capacities,
and assign each partition to a specific VPN for applying the decentralized
abstraction schemes presented in [2]. First, we present two schemes based on
the maximum concurrent flow and the maximum multicommodity flow (MMCF)
formulations. We then propose approaches to address the fairness concerns that
arise when MMCF formulation is used. We present results based on extensive
simulations on several topologies, and provide a comparative evaluation of the
different schemes in terms of abstraction efficiency, fairness to VPNs and call

experimentally the transport of the grains of a granular bed sheared by a

flows were imposed over a flat granular bed of known granulometry. Under the
tested conditions, the grains were transported as bed load, i.e., they became
entrained by rolling and sliding over each other, forming a moving granular
layer. The present experiments were performed close to incipient bed load, a
case for which experimental data on grains velocities are scarce. Distinct from
previous experiments, an entrance length assured that the water stream over the
loose bed was fully developed. At different water flow rates, the moving layer
was filmed using a high-speed camera, and the grains' displacements and

  Strikes Back","Added illustrations of functions used in some of the constructions",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In stochastic convex optimization the goal is to minimize a convex function
$F(x) \doteq {\mathbf E}_{{\mathbf f}\sim D}[{\mathbf f}(x)]$ over a convex set
$\cal K \subset {\mathbb R}^d$ where $D$ is some unknown distribution and each
$f(\cdot)$ in the support of $D$ is convex over $\cal K$. The optimization is
commonly based on i.i.d.~samples $f^1,f^2,\ldots,f^n$ from $D$. A standard
approach to such problems is empirical risk minimization (ERM) that optimizes
$F_S(x) \doteq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\leq n} f^i(x)$. Here we consider the question
of how many samples are necessary for ERM to succeed and the closely related
question of uniform convergence of $F_S$ to $F$ over $\cal K$. We demonstrate
that in the standard $\ell_p/\ell_q$ setting of Lipschitz-bounded functions
over a $\cal K$ of bounded radius, ERM requires sample size that scales
linearly with the dimension $d$. This nearly matches standard upper bounds and
improves on $\Omega(\log d)$ dependence proved for $\ell_2/\ell_2$ setting by
Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009). In stark contrast, these problems can be solved
using dimension-independent number of samples for $\ell_2/\ell_2$ setting and
$\log d$ dependence for $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ setting using other approaches. We
further show that our lower bound applies even if the functions in the support
of $D$ are smooth and efficiently computable and even if an $\ell_1$
regularization term is added. Finally, we demonstrate that for a more general

an infinite gap appears already in dimension 2.

be a hard problem. Both termination and non-termination are undecidable
problems in Turing-complete languages. However, some declarative languages
offer a practical work-around for this problem, by making a clear distinction
between whether a program is meant to be understood inductively or
coinductively. For programs meant to be understood inductively, termination
must be guaranteed, whereas for programs meant to be understood coinductively,
productive non-termination (or ""productivity"") must be ensured. In practice,
such classification helps to better understand and implement some
non-terminating computations.
  Logic programming was one of the first declarative languages to make this
distinction: in the 1980's, Lloyd and van Emden's ""computations at infinity""
captured the big-step operational semantics of derivations that produce
infinite terms as answers. In modern terms, computations at infinity describe
""global productivity"" of computations in logic programming. Most programming
languages featuring coinduction also provide an observational, or small-step,
notion of productivity as a computational counterpart to global productivity.
This kind of productivity is ensured by checking that finite initial fragments
of infinite computations can always be observed to produce finite portions of
their infinite answer terms.
  In this paper we introduce a notion of observational productivity for logic
programming as an algorithmic approximation of global productivity, give an
effective procedure for semi-deciding observational productivity, and offer an
implemented automated observational productivity checker for logic programs.

composition gas in dark matter minihalos with $\sim10^6\:M_\odot$ that are

protostellar support by dark matter annihilation heating that allows them to
accrete a large fraction of their minihalo gas, i.e., $\sim10^5\:M_\odot$.
Exploring $d_{\rm{iso}}$ from $10 - 100\:\rm{kpc}$ (proper distances), we
predict the redshift evolution of Pop III.1 source and SMBH remnant number
densities. The local, $z=0$ density of SMBHs constrains $d_{\rm{iso}}\lesssim
100\:\rm{kpc}$ (i.e., $3\:\rm{Mpc}$ comoving distance at $z\simeq30$). In our

to $20$ for $d_{\rm{iso}}=100$ to $50\:\rm{kpc}$. We follow source evolution to
$z=10$, by which point most SMBHs reside in halos with $\gtrsim10^8\:M_\odot$.
Over this period, there is relatively limited merging of SMBHs for these values
of $d_{\rm{iso}}$. We also predict SMBH clustering properties at $z=10$:
feedback suppression of neighboring sources leads to relatively flat angular
correlation functions.

aggregate flexibility is the Minkowski sum of the individual polytopes. In
order to represent their aggregate flexibility in an intuitive way and achieve
a tractable approximation, we develop optimization-based algorithms to
approximate the polytopes by the homothets of a given convex set. As a special
application, this set is chosen as a \emph{virtual battery model} and the
corresponding optimal approximations are solved efficiently by equivalent
linear programming problems. Numerical results show that our algorithms yield
significant improvement in characterizing the aggregate flexibility over
existing modeling methods. We also conduct case studies to demonstrate the
efficacy of our approaches by coordinating TCLs to track a frequency regulation

input-output examples, we try to synthesize source code that maps inputs to

based on neural networks and graphical models, and to understand the
capabilities of machine learning techniques relative to traditional
alternatives, such as those based on constraint solving from the programming
languages community.
  Our key contribution is the proposal of TerpreT, a domain-specific language
for expressing program synthesis problems. TerpreT is similar to a
probabilistic programming language: a model is composed of a specification of a
program representation (declarations of random variables) and an interpreter
describing how programs map inputs to outputs (a model connecting unknowns to
observations). The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples
and infer the underlying program. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it
enables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and
interpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the
inference algorithm, allowing like-to-like comparisons between different
approaches to inference. From a single TerpreT specification we automatically
perform inference using four different back-ends. These are based on gradient
descent, linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete
satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system.
  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models
and performing an empirical comparison between alternative inference
algorithms. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers dominate the
gradient descent and LP-based formulations. We conclude with suggestions for
the machine learning community to make progress on program synthesis.

method for reading out the state of donor spins in silicon. The technique
relies on a spin-dependent recombination (SDR) process involving dopant spins
that are coupled to interfacial defect spins near the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. To
prevent ionization of the donors, the experiments are performed at cryogenic
temperatures and the mobile charge carriers needed are generated via optical
excitation. The influence of this optical excitation on the SDR process and the
resulting EDMR signal is still not well understood. Here, we use EDMR to
characterize changes to both phosphorus and defect spin readout as a function
of optical excitation using: a 980 nm laser with energy just above the silicon
band edge at cryogenic temperatures; a 405 nm laser to generate hot
surface-carriers; and a broadband white light source. EDMR signals are observed
from the phosphorus donor and two distinct defect species in all the
experiments. With near-infrared excitation, we find that the EDMR signal
primarily arises from donor-defect pairs, while at higher photon energies there
are significant additional contributions from defect-defect pairs. The optical
penetration depth into silicon is also known to be strongly wavelength
dependent at cryogenic temperatures. The energy of the optical excitation is
observed to strongly modulate the kinetics of the SDR process. Careful tuning
of the optical photon energy could therefore be used to control both the subset
of spin pairs contributing to the EDMR signal as well as the dynamics of the

sample of type Ia supernovae will be observed, allowing for a precise mapping
of the velocity structure of the universe. Since the source of peculiar
velocities is variations in the density field, cosmological parameters related
to the matter distribution can subsequently be extracted from the velocity
power spectrum.
  One way to quantify this is through the angular power spectrum of radial
peculiar velocities on spheres at different redshifts. We investigate how well
this observable can be measured, despite the problems caused by areas with no
information. To obtain a realistic distribution of supernovae, we create mock
supernova catalogs by using a semi-analytical code for galaxy formation on the
merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. We measure the cosmic variance
in the velocity power spectrum by repeating the procedure many times for
differently located observers, and vary different aspects of the analysis, such
as the observer environment, to see how this affects the measurements.
  Our results confirm the findings from earlier studies regarding the precision
with which the angular velocity power spectrum can be determined in the near
future. This level of precision has been found to imply, that the angular
velocity power spectrum from type Ia supernovae is competitive in its potential
to measure parameters such as $\sigma_8$. This makes the peculiar velocity
power spectrum from type Ia supernovae a promising new observable, which

(mid-IR) pulses can provide unique opportunities of exploring phase-sensitive
strong-field light-matter interactions in atoms, molecules, and solids. In the
mid-IR wavelength, the ponderomotive energy of laser pulses is dramatically
increased (versus the visible/near-infrared) and, therefore, the Keldysh
parameter is much smaller than unity even at relatively modest laser
intensities. This enables to study the sub-cycle electron dynamics in solids
via high-harmonic generation (HHG) without damage. One can also control the
electron emissions from nano-devices in the sub-cycle time scale. These efforts
are opening a great opportunity towards petahertz electronics. Here, we present
a high-energy, sub-cycle pulse synthesizer based on a mid-IR optical parametric
amplifier (OPA), pumped by CEP-stable, 2.1 um femtosecond pulses, and its
application to HHG in solids. The signal and idler combined spectrum spans from
2.5 to 9.0 um, which covers the whole midwave-infrared (MWIR) region. We
coherently synthesize the passively CEP-stable few-cycle signal and idler
pulses to generate 33 uJ, 0.88-cycle (12.4 fs), multi-GW pulses centered at
~4.2 um, which is further energy scalable. The in-line synthesis of the
CEP-stable sub-cycle pulse is realized through the type-I collinear OPA with
minimal temporal walk-off. The MWIR sub-cycle pulse is used for driving HHG in
thin silicon samples, producing harmonics up to ~19th order with a continuous
spectral coverage due to the isolated emission by the sub-cycle driver. Our
demonstration offers an energy scalable and technically simple platform of

scrutiny for its intriguing magnetoelectric phenomenon as well as technological
advances in spintronics. Herein, the tremendous effect of an epitaxial strain
on voltage-controlled perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (VPMA) is demonstrated
in a transition-metal/ferromagnet/MgO (TM/FM/MgO) heterostructure from
first-principles electronic structure computation. By tuning the epitaxial
strain in Ta/Fe/MgO as a model system of TM/FM/MgO, we find distinctly
different behaviours of VPMA from V- to {\Lambda}-shape trends with a
substantially large magnetoelectric coefficient, up to an order of 1000 fJ/Vm.
We further reveal that the VPMA modulation under strain is mainly governed by
the inherently large spin-orbit coupling of Ta 5d-Fe 3d hybridized orbitals at
the TM/FM interface, although the Fe 3d-O 2p hybridization at the FM/MgO is
partly responsible in determining the PMA of Ta/Fe/MgO. These results suggest
that the control of epitaxial strain enables the engineering of VPMA, and
provides physical insights for the divergent behaviors of VPMA and
magnetoelectric coefficients found in TM/FM/MgO experiments.

dimensionality for regressions or the number of factors for factor models. This
longstanding problem is caused by the existence of one or two dominating
eigenvalues compared to other nonzero eigenvalues. To alleviate this
difficulty, we propose a thresholding double ridge ratio criterion such that
the true dimension can be better identified and is less underdetermined. Unlike
all existing eigendecomposition-based criteria, this criterion can define
consistent estimate without requiring the uniqueness of minimum and can then
handle possible multiple local minima scenarios. This generic strategy would be
readily applied to other dimensionality or order determination problems. In
this paper, we systematically investigate, for general sufficient dimension
reduction theory, the dimensionality determination with fixed and divergent
dimensions; for local alternative models that converge to its limiting model
with fewer projected covariates, discuss when the number of projected
covariates can be consistently estimated, when cannot; and for ultra-high
dimensional factor models, study the estimation consistency for the number of
common factors. Numerical studies are conducted to examine the finite sample

noisy operations, generated by the interaction with ancillas in the

independently allocate their transmit power over the sub-channels without the
need of centralized control. Under this framework, we aim to design
lifetime-maximizing power allocation and efficient voting-based feedback
methods. Towards this end, we first derive the general expression of the
expected lifetime of a WPT network and draw the general design principles for
lifetime-maximizing charging control. Based on the analysis, we then propose a
distributed charging control protocol with voting-based feedback, where the
power allocated to sub-channels at each EN is a function of the weighted sum
vote received from all WDs. Besides, the number of votes cast by a WD and the
weight of each vote are related to its current battery state. Simulation
results show that the proposed distributed charging control protocol could
significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power
constraint in a broadband WPT network.

expansion of the existing transmission infrastructure to accommodate inflected

renewables integration requires additional reactive power support, which forces
the transmission system operators to utilize the existing grid creatively,
e.g., take advantage of new technologies, such as flexible alternating current
transmission system (FACTS) devices. We formulate, analyze and solve the
challenging investment planning problem of installation in an existing
large-scale transmission grid multiple FACTS devices of two types (series
capacitors and static VAR compensators.) We account for details of AC character
of the power flows, probabilistic modeling of multiple-load scenarios, FACTS
devices flexibility in terms of their adjustments within the capacity
constraints, and long term practical tradeoffs between capital vs operational
expenditures (CAPEX vs OPEX). It is demonstrated that proper installation of
the devices allows to do both - extend or improve feasibility domain for the
system and also decrease long term power generation cost (make cheaper
generation available). Nonlinear, nonconvex, and multiple-scenario-aware
optimization is resolved through an efficient heuristic algorithm consisting of
a sequence of quadratic programmings solved by CPLEX combined with exact AC PF
resolution for each scenario for maintaining feasible operational states during
iterations. Efficiency and scalability of the approach is illustrated on the

data in human-interactive systems. While implicit feedback has many advantages
(e.g., it is inexpensive to collect, user centric, and timely), its inherent
biases are a key obstacle to its effective use. For example, position bias in
search rankings strongly influences how many clicks a result receives, so that
directly using click data as a training signal in Learning-to-Rank (LTR)
methods yields sub-optimal results. To overcome this bias problem, we present a
counterfactual inference framework that provides the theoretical basis for
unbiased LTR via Empirical Risk Minimization despite biased data. Using this
framework, we derive a Propensity-Weighted Ranking SVM for discriminative
learning from implicit feedback, where click models take the role of the
propensity estimator. In contrast to most conventional approaches to de-bias
the data using click models, this allows training of ranking functions even in
settings where queries do not repeat. Beyond the theoretical support, we show
empirically that the proposed learning method is highly effective in dealing
with biases, that it is robust to noise and propensity model misspecification,

Hyperion} radiation hydrodynamics solver, considering the regime that is
optically thick to ultraviolet (UV) and optically thin to infrared (IR)
radiation. Our model clouds cover initial surface densities between
$\Sigma_{\rm cl,0} \sim 10-300~M_{\odot}~{\rm pc^{-2}}$, with varying initial
turbulence. We follow them through turbulent, self-gravitating collapse,
formation of star clusters, and cloud dispersal by stellar radiation. All our
models display a lognormal distribution of gas surface density $\Sigma$; for an
initial virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir,0} = 2$, the lognormal standard
deviation is $\sigma_{\rm ln \Sigma} = 1-1.5$ and the star formation rate
coefficient $\varepsilon_{\rm ff,\bar\rho} = 0.3-0.5$, both of which are
sensitive to turbulence but not radiation feedback. The net star formation
efficiency $\varepsilon_\mathrm{final}$ increases with $\Sigma_{\rm cl,0}$ and
decreases with $\alpha_{\rm vir,0}$. We interpret these results via a simple
conceptual framework, whereby steady star formation increases the radiation
force, such that local gas patches at successively higher $\Sigma$ become
unbound. Based on this formalism (with fixed $\sigma_{\rm ln \Sigma}$), we
provide an analytic upper bound on $\varepsilon_\mathrm{final}$, which is in
good agreement with our numerical results. The final star formation efficiency
depends on the distribution of Eddington ratios in the cloud and is strongly
increased by turbulent compression of gas.

give the currently best BC approximation algorithm, with a high probability to
successfully estimate the BC of one vertex within a factor of $1/\varepsilon$

probability that a target node is reachable from a source node in a
probabilistic (or uncertain) graph, i.e., a graph where every edge is assigned
a probability of existence. Many approaches and problem variants have been
considered in the literature, all assuming that edge-existence probabilities
are fixed. Nevertheless, in real-world graphs, edge probabilities typically
depend on external conditions. In metabolic networks a protein can be converted
into another protein with some probability depending on the presence of certain
enzymes. In social influence networks the probability that a tweet of some user
will be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains
specific hashtags. In transportation networks the probability that a network
segment will work properly or not might depend on external conditions such as
weather or time of the day. In this paper we overcome this limitation and focus
on conditional reliability, that is assessing reliability when edge-existence
probabilities depend on a set of conditions. In particular, we study the
problem of determining the k conditions that maximize the reliability between
two nodes. We deeply characterize our problem and show that, even employing
polynomial-time reliability-estimation methods, it is NP-hard, does not admit
any PTAS, and the underlying objective function is non-submodular. We then
devise a practical method that targets both accuracy and efficiency. We also
study natural generalizations of the problem with multiple source and target
nodes. An extensive empirical evaluation on several large, real-life graphs
demonstrates effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods.

It is known that, similar to the two-marginal case, c-splitting sets are
c-cyclically monotone. Within a suitable framework, the converse implication
was very recently established by Griessler. However, for an arbitrary cost c,
given a multi-marginal c-cyclically monotone set, the question whether there
exists an analogous explicit construction to the one from the two-marginal case
of c-splitting potentials is still open. When the margins are one-dimensional
and the cost belongs to a certain class, Carlier proved that the two-marginal
projections of a c-splitting set are monotone. For arbitrary products of sets
equipped with cost functions which are sums of two-marginal costs, we show that
the two-marginal monotonicity condition is a sufficient condition which does
give rise to an explicit construction of c-splitting potentials. Our condition
is, in principle, easier to verify than the one of multi-marginal c-cyclic
monotonicity. Various examples illustrate our results. We show that, in
general, our condition is sufficient; however, it is not necessary. On the
other hand, we conclude that when the margins are one-dimensional equipped with
classical cost functions, our condition is a characterization of c-splitting
sets and extends classical convex analysis.

planetary-system formation process. In particular, faint warm debris disks may
be related to late planet formation near 1 AU. A systematic search of faint
warm debris disks is necessary to reveal terrestrial planet formation. Aims:
Faint warm debris disks show excess emission that peaks at mid-IR wavelengths.
Thus we explore debris disks using the AKARI mid-IR all-sky point source
catalog (PSC), a product of the second generation unbiased IR all-sky survey.
Methods : We investigate IR excess emission for 678 isolated main-sequence
stars for which there are 18 micron detections in the AKARI mid-IR all-sky
catalog by comparing their fluxes with the predicted fluxes of the photospheres
based on optical to near-IR fluxes and model spectra. The near-IR fluxes are
first taken from the 2MASS PSC. However, 286 stars with Ks<4.5 in our sample
have large flux errors in the 2MASS photometry due to saturation. Thus we have
measured accurate J, H, and Ks band fluxes, applying neutral density (ND)
filters for Simultaneous InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) on IRSF,
the \phi 1.4 m near-IR telescope in South Africa, and improved the flux
accuracy from 14% to 1.8% on average. Results: We identified 53 debris-disk
candidates including eight new detections from our sample of 678 main-sequence
stars. The detection rate of debris disks for this work is ~8%, which is
comparable with those in previous works by Spitzer and Herschel. Conclusion:
The importance of this study is the detection of faint warm debris disks around
nearby field stars. At least nine objects have a large amount of dust for their
ages, which cannot be explained by the conventional steady-state collisional
cascade model.

frame and using the density matrix renormalization group method as an impurity
solver, we provide a proper description of incommensurate magnetizations at
zero temperature in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). It
is shown that the incommensurate spiral magnetic order for $t^\prime/t\gtrsim
0.7$ survives the dynamical fluctuations of itinerant electrons in the Hubbard
interaction range from the strong-coupling (localized-spin) limit down to the
insulator-to-metal transition. We also find that the magnetic moment reduction
from the localized-spin limit is pronounced in the vicinity of the transition
between the commensurate N\'eel and incommensurate spiral phases at
$t^\prime/t\sim 0.7$. When the anisotropy parameter $t^\prime/t$ increases from
the N\'eel-to-spiral transition, the magnitude of the magnetic moment
immediately reaches a maximum and then rapidly decreases in the range of larger
$t^\prime/t$ including the isotropic triangular lattice point $t^\prime/t=1$.
This work gives a solid foundation for further extension of the study including
nonlocal correlation effects neglected at the standard DMFT level.

disorders arise from the coupling of system and bath. We consider both the same

off-diagonal bath coupling elements fluctuate independently of each other and
the dynamics is complicated. We obtain the time dependent population
distribution by solving quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE) derived by
Kubo. The main result of our study is both the population transfer dynamics and
the mean square displacement of the exciton behave the similar way in the same
and independent bath cases in the Markovian limit. However, these two baths can
give rise to markedly different behavior in the non-Markovian limit where
coherent transport becomes important. There are also several additional new
results as follows. (i) Exciton migration remains coherent all the time for an
average, non-zero off-diagonal coupling value J for the same bath case while it
becomes incoherent for independent bath case in the Markovian limit. (ii) An
oscillatory behavior of the population transfer dynamics supports the coherent
mode of transfer of exciton. (iii) Agreement with available analytical
expression of mean squared displacement is good in the Markovian limit for
independent bath case with off-diagonal fluctuation but only qualitative in the
non-Markovian limit for which no complete analytical solution is available.
(iv) Transition from coherent to incoherent transport is observed in the
independent bath case with diagonal fluctuation when the bath is made
progressively more Markovian. (v) The correlation time of the bath plays a
unique role in dictating the diffusive spread that is not anticipated in a
Markovian treatment.

in an evolutionary stage intermediate between a normal O-star and a Wolf-Rayet
star. Such a star could provide a test for theoretical models aiming at
explaining the empirical scaling relation between the X-ray and bolometric

further collected optical spectroscopy of some of the O-star members of the

BD+60$^{\circ}$ 497 and HD15558, and provide the first evidence of binarity for
BD+60$^{\circ}$ 498. X-ray emission from colliding winds does not appear to
play an important role among the O-stars of IC1805. Notably, the X-ray fluxes
do not vary significantly between archival X-ray observations and our
XMM-Newton pointing. The very fast rotator BD+60$^{\circ}$ 513, and to a lesser

underluminosity of HD15570 is only marginally significant, its amplitude is
found to be compatible with theoretical expectations based on its stellar and
wind properties. A number of other X-ray sources are detected in the field, and
the brightest objects, many of which are likely low-mass pre-main sequence
stars, are analyzed in detail.

Another common method is to adopt a robust M-estimation by down-weighting

features: (1) It does not need to model the mislabel probabilities. (2) The
minimum gamma-divergence estimation leads to a weighted estimating equation
without the need to subtract any bias correction term, i.e., it is
automatically bias corrected. These properties make the proposed gamma-logistic
regression more robust in model fitting and more intuitive for model

challenging due to the necessity to use low radio frequencies at which
scintillation due to the ionosphere could confuse the interplanetary
contribution. A recent paper by Kaplan {\it et al} (2015) presenting
observations using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) reports evidence of
night-side IPS on two radio sources within their field of view. However, the
low time cadence of 2\,s used might be expected to average out the IPS signal,
resulting in the reasonable assumption that the scintillation is more likely to
be ionospheric in origin. To verify or otherwise this assumption, this letter
uses observations of IPS taken at a high time cadence using the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR). Averaging these to the same as the MWA observations, we
demonstrate that the MWA result is consistent with IPS, although some
contribution from the ionosphere cannot be ruled out. These LOFAR observations
represent the first of night-side IPS using LOFAR, with solar wind speeds
consistent with a slow solar wind stream in one observation and a CME expecting
to be observed in another.

past decade, the dynamic infrared sky remains virtually unexplored. The
infrared is a powerful tool for probing transient events in dusty regions that
have high optical extinction, and for detecting the coolest of stars that are
bright only at these wavelengths. The fundamental roadblocks in studying the
infrared time-domain have been the overwhelmingly bright sky background (250
times brighter than optical) and the narrow field-of-view of infrared cameras
(largest is 0.6 sq deg). To begin to address these challenges and open a new
observational window in the infrared, we present Palomar Gattini-IR: a 25 sq
degree, 300mm aperture, infrared telescope at Palomar Observatory that surveys
the entire accessible sky (20,000 sq deg) to a depth of 16.4 AB mag (J band,
1.25um) every night. Palomar Gattini-IR is wider in area than every existing
infrared camera by more than a factor of 40 and is able to survey large areas
of sky multiple times. We anticipate the potential for otherwise infeasible
discoveries, including, for example, the elusive electromagnetic counterparts
to gravitational wave detections. With dedicated hardware in hand, and a F/1.44
telescope available commercially and cost-effectively, Palomar Gattini-IR will
be on-sky in early 2017 and will survey the entire accessible sky every night
for two years. Palomar Gattini-IR will pave the way for a dual hemisphere,
infrared-optimized, ultra-wide field high cadence machine called Turbo
Gattini-IR. To take advantage of the low sky background at 2.5 um, two
identical systems will be located at the polar sites of the South Pole,
Antarctica and near Eureka on Ellesmere Island, Canada. Turbo Gattini-IR will
survey 15,000 sq. degrees to a depth of 20AB, the same depth of the VISTA VHS
survey, every 2 hours with a survey efficiency of 97%.

  Pheromone Traces","74 pages",,,"CIS-2016-04","cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A team of identical and oblivious ant-like agents - a(ge)nts - leaving
pheromone traces, are programmed to jointly patrol an area modeled as a graph.
They perform this task using simple local interactions, while also achieving
the important byproduct of partitioning the graph into roughly equal-sized
disjoint sub-graphs. Each a(ge)nt begins to operate at an arbitrary initial
location, and throughout its work does not acquire any information on either
the shape or size of the graph, or the number or whereabouts of other a(ge)nts.
Graph partitioning occurs spontaneously, as each of the a(ge)nts patrols and
expands its own pheromone-marked sub-graph, or region. This graph partitioning
algorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic
balloons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region
more frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent
vertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding
its region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a
region ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely
proportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller
region will effectively exert higher ""pressure"" at its borders, and conquer
adjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region
and shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes
of the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical
balloons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.
The pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to
evolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the
graph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the
system settles into a stable and balanced partition.

Sumino. The model can give FGBs with a considerably low energy scale in spite

An essential idea in Model A is in the so-called Sumino cancellation mechanism
between QED and FGB diagrams. However, Model A is not anomaly free and,
besides, it causes effective interactions with $\Delta N_{\rm family}=2$. In
order to avoid these problems, a revised Sumino model with an inverted mass

Sumino cancellation mechanism exactly. In this paper, we propose a revised
version of Model B, where the model still keeps anomaly free, but it can

confirmed by observations $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ e^- \mu^+$ and $\mu^-

matrix rank by shrinking all singular values equally. However, the singular
values have clear physical meanings in many practical problems, and NNM may not
be able to faithfully approximate the matrix rank. To alleviate the
above-mentioned limitation of NNM, recent studies have suggested that the
weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) can achieve a better rank estimation
than NNM, which heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular
values. However, it still lacks a rigorous explanation why WNNM is more
effective than NMM in various applications. In this paper, we analyze NNM and
WNNM from the perspective of group sparse representation (GSR). Concretely, an
adaptive dictionary learning method is devised to connect the rank minimization
and GSR models. Based on the proposed dictionary, we prove that NNM and WNNM
are equivalent to L1-norm minimization and the weighted L1-norm minimization in
GSR, respectively. Inspired by enhancing sparsity of the weighted L1-norm
minimization in comparison with L1-norm minimization in sparse representation,
we thus explain that WNNM is more effective than NMM. By integrating the image
nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior with the WNNM model, we then apply it to
solve the image denoising problem. Experimental results demonstrate that WNNM
is more effective than NNM and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in
both objective and perceptual quality.

structures of different shapes and sizes. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
can be used to create these structures either through mechanical contact
between the tip and the surface or through electro-exfoliation. In the latter,
the mechanisms involved in the process of exfoliation with an applied voltage
are not fully understood. Here we show how a graphite surface can be locally
exfoliated in a systematic manner by applying an electrostatic force with a STM
tip at the edge of a terrace, forming triangular flakes several nanometers in
length. We demonstrate, through experiments and simulations, how these flakes
are created by a two-step process: first a voltage ramp must be applied at the
edge of the terrace, and then the tip must be scanned perpendicularly to the
edge. Ab-initio electrostatic calculations reveal that the presence of charges
on the graphite surface weakens the interaction between layers allowing for
exfoliation at voltages in the same range as those used experimentally.
Molecular dynamics simulations show that a force applied locally on the edge of
a step produces triangular flakes such as those observed under STM. Our results
provide new insights towards surface modification that can be extended to other
layered materials.

powerful means of describing the rich connectivity structure of the cosmic web

algebraic topology and Morse theory, Betti numbers and persistence diagrams
represent an extension and deepening of the cosmologically familiar topological
genus measure, and the related geometric Minkowski functionals. In addition to
a description of the mathematical background, this study presents the
computational procedure for computing Betti numbers and persistence diagrams
for density field filtrations. The field may be computed starting from a
discrete spatial distribution of galaxies or simulation particles. The main
emphasis of this study concerns an extensive and systematic exploration of the
imprint of different weblike morphologies and different levels of multiscale
clustering in the corresponding computed Betti numbers and persistence
diagrams. To this end, we use Voronoi clustering models as templates for a rich
variety of weblike configurations, and the fractal-like Soneira-Peebles models
exemplify a range of multiscale configurations. We have identified the clear
imprint of cluster nodes, filaments, walls, and voids in persistence diagrams,
along with that of the nested hierarchy of structures in multiscale point
distributions. We conclude by outlining the potential of persistent topology
for understanding the connectivity structure of the cosmic web, in large
simulations of cosmic structure formation and in the challenging context of the
observed galaxy distribution in large galaxy surveys.

The offsets are a priori not known to the BBU. With the aim of counteracting

the classical Temperley-Lieb algebra, while for each choice of standard Coxeter
element the corresponding noncrossing partitions also index a basis, given by
the images in the Temperley-Lieb algebra of the simple elements of the dual
Garside structure (associated to this choice of standard Coxeter element) of
the Artin braid group on $n+1$ strands. We then show that our bijections come
from triangular base changes between the diagram basis and the various bases
indexed by noncrossing partitions, by explicitly describing the orders giving
triangularity. These orders were introduced in a joint paper with Williams and
provide exotic lattice structures on noncrossing partitions. Several

proposed. However, these methods only highlight one or two structural features
of networks, and then use the methods to predict missing links in different
networks. The performances of these existing methods are not always satisfied
in all cases since each network has its unique underlying structural features.
In this paper, by analyzing different real networks, we find that the
structural features of different networks are remarkably different. In
particular, even in the same network, their inner structural features are
utterly different. Therefore, more structural features should be considered.
However, owing to the remarkably different structural features, the
contributions of different features are hard to be given in advance. Inspired
by these facts, an \emph{adaptive} fusion model regarding link prediction is
proposed to incorporate multiple structural features. In the model, a logistic
function combing multiple structural features is defined, then the weight of
each feature in the logistic function is \emph{adaptively} determined by
exploiting the known structure information. Last, we use the ""learnt"" logistic
function to predict the connection probabilities of missing links. According to
our experimental results, we find that the performance of our adaptive fusion
model is better than many similarity indices.

an extremely powerful cryptographic primitive that enables to perform
computations, i.e., to evaluate circuits, on encrypted data without decrypting
them first. This has many applications, in particular in cloud computing.
  In all currently known FHE schemes, encryptions are associated to some
(non-negative integer) noise level, and at each evaluation of an AND gate, the
noise level increases. This is problematic because decryption can only work if
the noise level stays below some maximum level $L$ at every gate of the
circuit. To ensure that property, it is possible to perform an operation called
\emph{bootstrapping} to reduce the noise level. However, bootstrapping is
time-consuming and has been identified as a critical operation. This motivates
a new problem in discrete optimization, that of choosing where in the circuit
to perform bootstrapping operations so as to control the noise level; the goal
is to minimize the number of bootstrappings in circuits.
  In this paper, we formally define the \emph{bootstrap problem}, we design a
polynomial-time $L$-approximation algorithm using a novel method of rounding of
a linear program, and we show a matching hardness result:
$(L-\epsilon)$-inapproximability for any $\epsilon>0$.

  The analysis of relative changes in mean gene expression before and after

non-trivially depend on the inherent noisiness of a given gene, quantified by
maximal mean frequency of bursts.
  Moreover, we find that the dependence of gene expression noise on gene copy
number and auto-regulation strength may qualitatively differ, e.g. in
monotonicity, depending on whether the noise is measured by Fano factor or
coefficient of variation. Thus, experimentally-based hypotheses linking gene

collapsing stellar cores may be the product of a former merger process of two

calculations to assess the expected fraction of such rapidly rotating stellar
cores which may lead to fission and formation of a pair of proto-neutron stars.
We have used the BSE population synthesis code supplemented with a new
treatment of stellar core rotation during the evolution via effective
core-envelope coupling, characterized by the coupling time, $\tau_c$. The
validity of this approach is checked by direct MESA calculations of the
evolution of a rotating 15 $M_\odot$ star. From comparison of the calculated
spin distribution of young neutron stars with the observed one, reported by

statistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the
significantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH
and AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with
northward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the
sudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is
relative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks

Furthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly

that a stellar evolutionary effect is the underlying cause.

explore the dataset of the OECD Better Life Index and compute for each country
a weight vector which brings it as far up in the ranking as possible with the
greatest advance of the immediate rivals. The method is able to answer the
question ""What is the best possible rank a country can achieve with a given set
of weighted indicators?"" Typically, weights in composite indicators are
justified normatively and not empirically. Our approach helps to give bounds on
what is achievable by such normative judgments from a purely output-oriented
and strongly competitive perspective. The method can serve as a basis for exact
bounds in sensitivity analysis focused on ranking positions.
  In the OECD Better Life Index data we find that 19 out the 36 countries in
the OECD Better Life Index 2014 can be brought to the top of the ranking by
specific weights. We give a table of weights for each country which brings it
to its highest possible position. Many countries achieve their best rank by
focusing on their strong dimensions and setting the weights of many others to
zero. Although setting dimensions to zero is possible in the OECD's online
tool, this contradicts the idea of better life being multidimensional in
essence. We discuss modifications of the optimization problem which could take
this into account, e.g. by allowing only a minimal weight of one.
  Methods to find rank-optimal weights can be useful for various
multidimensional datasets like the ones used to rank universities or employers.

server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate
validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this
paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of
its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server
authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for
location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to
verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server
authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence
at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center.
SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued
certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a
prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that
it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is
backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for
improving server authentication in TLS.

source, i.e., the node that started the epidemic. If we know the time at which
various nodes were infected, we can attempt to use this information in order to
identify the source. However, maintaining observer nodes that can provide their
infection time may be costly, and we may have a budget $k$ on the number of
observer nodes we can maintain. Moreover, some nodes are more informative than
others due to their location in the network. Hence, a pertinent question
arises: Which nodes should we select as observers in order to maximize the
probability that we can accurately identify the source? Inspired by the simple
setting in which the node-to-node delays in the transmission of the epidemic
are deterministic, we develop a principled approach for addressing the problem
even when transmission delays are random. We show that the optimal
observer-placement differs depending on the variance of the transmission delays

subgroup $A$ of $G$ is already guaranteed by a seemingly weaker condition: $A$
is subnormal in $G$ if for every conjugacy class $C$ of $G$ there exists $c\in
C$ for which $A$ is subnormal in $\seq{A,c}$. We also prove the following
property of finite non-abelian simple groups: if $A$ is a subgroup of odd prime
order $p$ in a finite almost simple group $G$, then there exists a cyclic
$p'$-subgroup of $F^*(G)$ which does not normalise any non-trivial $p$-subgroup
of $G$ that is generated by conjugates of~$A$.

observed a maximum shift of 0.4 G in the internal field of muons at the surface
of Au film which is in close agreement to the value expected for Oersted
fields. As muons are implanted closer to the Au|YIG interface the shift is
strongly suppressed, which we attribute to the dipolar fields present at the
Au|YIG interface. Combining our measurements with modelling, we show that
dipolar fields caused by the finite roughness of the Au|YIG interface
consistently explains our observations. Our results, therefore, gauge the
limits on the spatial resolution and the sensitivity of LE-muSR to the

than the Milky Way; they are not ""red and dead"" ellipticals. Earlier radio

multi-wavelength energies. A time resolved study of its spectral energy
distribution (SED) shows that above 1 keV its power output is changing along
its binary orbit as well as being a function of energy. To disentangle the
energy dependence of the power output as a function of orbital phase, we
investigated in detail the orbital light curves as derived with different
telescopes at different energy bands. We analysed the data from all existing
\textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS/ISGRI observations of the source and generated the most
up-to-date orbital light curves at hard X-ray energies. In the $\gamma$-ray
band, we carried out orbital phase-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data
between 30 MeV and 10 GeV in 5 different energy bands. We found that, at
$\lesssim$100 MeV and $\gtrsim$1 TeV the peak of the $\gamma$-ray emission is
near orbital phase 0.7, while between $\sim$100 MeV and $\sim$1 GeV it moves
close to orbital phase 1.0 in an orbital anti-clockwise manner. This result
suggests that the transition region in the SED at soft $\gamma$-rays (below a
hundred MeV) is related to the orbital phase interval of 0.5--1.0 but not to
the one of 0.0--0.5, when the compact object is ""behind"" its companion. Another
interesting result is that between 3 and 20 GeV no orbital modulation is found,
although \textit{Fermi}-LAT significantly ($\sim$18$\sigma$) detects LS 5039.
This is consistent with the fact that at these energies, the contributions to
the overall emission from the inferior conjunction phase region (INFC, orbital
phase 0.45 to 0.9) and from the superior conjunction phase region (SUPC,
orbital phase 0.9 to 0.45) are equal in strength. At TeV energies the power
output is again dominant in the INFC region and the flux peak occurs at phase
$\sim$0.7.

automata on infinite words. Originally introduced for modeling of coordinators,
an interesting new application of CAs is implementing coordinators (i.e.,
compiling CAs into executable code). Such an approach guarantees
correctness-by-construction and can even yield code that outperforms
hand-crafted code. The extent to which these two potential advantages
materialize depends on the smartness of CA-compilers and the existence of
proofs of their correctness.
  Every transition in a CA is labeled by a ""data constraint"" that specifies an
atomic data-flow between coordinated processes as a first-order formula. At
run-time, compiler-generated code must handle data constraints as efficiently
as possible. In this paper, we present, and prove the correctness of two
optimization techniques for CA-compilers related to handling of data
constraints: a reduction to eliminate redundant variables and a translation
from (declarative) data constraints to (imperative) data commands expressed in
a small sequential language. Through experiments, we show that these
optimization techniques can have a positive impact on performance of generated
executable code.

Despite the stochasticity, stability criteria can be formulated when averaging
over many realizations in the asymptotic time limit and serve to determine the
boundary line in parameter space that separates regions of growing amplitudes
from those of decaying ones. Furthermore, the concept of $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry remains applicable for such a stochastic oscillator and we use it to
distinguish between an underdamped symmetric phase and an overdamped asymmetric
phase. In the former case, the limit of stability is marked by the same average
duration for the gain and loss states, whilst in the the latter case, a higher
duration of the loss state is necessary to keep the system stable. The
overdamped phase has an ordered structure imposing a position-velocity ratio
locking and is viewed as a phase transition from the underdamped phase, which
instead displays a broad and more disordered, but nevertheless, $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetric structure. We also address the short time limit and the dynamics of
the moments of the position and the velocity with the aim of revealing the
extremely rich dynamics offered by this apparently quite simple mechanical
system. The notions established so far may be extended and applied in the
stabilization of light propagation in metamaterials and optical fibres with

examples, optimal bounds on emerging macro quantities, application etc. Five
among them are highlighted below : $(1)$ The usual arguments based on
translated inequality, $H$-measures, Compensated Compactness etc for obtaining
optimal bounds are not enough. Additional compactness properties are needed.
$(2)$ Assuming two-phase microstructures, the bounds define naturally four
optimal regions in the phase space of macro quantities. The classically known
single region in the self-interacting case , namely $B^\epsilon= A^\epsilon$
can be recovered from them, a result that indicates we are dealing with a true

is not immediate because of (a priori) non-commutativity of macro-matrices, an
issue not present in the self-interacting case. Somewhat surprisingly though,
commutativity follows a posteriori. $(4)$ From the application to ""Optimal
Oscillation-Dissipation Problems"", it emerges that oscillations and dissipation

$N$-rank laminates with interfaces. This is a new feature. $(5)$ Explicit

Wave energy densities are transported along ray trajectories through polygonal

defined over meshed surfaces. Many applications require the resolution of wave
energy distributions in three-dimensional domains, such as in room acoustics,
underwater acoustics and for electromagnetic cavity problems. In this work we
extend discrete flow mapping to three-dimensional domains by propagating wave
energy densities through tetrahedral meshes. The geometric simplicity of the
tetrahedral mesh elements is utilised to efficiently compute the ray transfer
operator using a mixture of analytic and spectrally accurate numerical
integration. The important issue of how to choose a suitable basis

is addressed via low order local approximations on tetrahedral faces in the
position coordinate and high order orthogonal polynomial expansions in momentum

range (i.e., planet-to-star contrast in brightness) currently relies on
coronagraphic technology combined with active control of one or more deformable
mirrors (DMs) to create a dark region in the image plane, sometimes called a
""dark hole."" While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, all of
them employ focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWS) in order to calculate the
optimal DM configuration to create the desired dark hole. All current
algorithms are limited by their own success in that, as the dark hole is
achieved, the FPWS procedure becomes shot-noise limited due to he low intensity
in the dark hole. This article proposes a FPWS procedure that allows
determination of the optimal DM configuration without relying on information
obtained when the DM is near the optimal configuration. This article gives
regression procedures for FPWS that do not assume the DM step size is small,
which should allow two important improvements to the control loop: 1)
performing informative FPWS observations with DM configurations that are
sufficiently distant from the optimal dark hole configuration to mitigate
shot-noise limitations, and 2) more accurately predicting the DM configuration
that will achieve the desired objective in the dark hole control loop. In order
to treat this more challenging FPWS problem, two different representations are
presented. The first of these, is called the empirical Green's function (EGF),
is easy to implement, and has a block-diagonal matrix structure that is
well-suited to parallel processing. The other representation, based on an
explicit aberration expansion (EAE) requires the regression to estimate a
smaller number of parameters than the EGF, but leads to a dense matrix
structure. The EGF and EAE methods both simultaneously estimate the planetary
image.

salient feature of two-dimensional turbulence. If the cascade reaches the
system scale, it creates a coherent flow expected to have the largest available
scale and conform with the symmetries of the domain. In a doubly periodic
rectangle, the mean flow with zero total momentum was therefore believed to be
unidirectional, with two jets along the short side; while for an aspect ratio
close to unity, a vortex dipole was expected. Using direct numerical
simulations, we show that in fact neither the box symmetry is respected nor the
largest scale is realized: the flow is never purely unidirectional since the
inverse cascade produces coherent vortices, whose number and relative motion
are determined by the aspect ratio. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is
closely related to the hierarchy of averaging times. Long-time averaging
restores translational invariance due to vortex wandering along one direction,

problems onto an auxiliary open quantum system of small size. The infinite
fermionic reservoirs of the original system are thereby replaced by a small
number $N_B$ of noninteracting auxiliary bath sites whose dynamics is described
by a Lindblad equation. Due to the presence of the intermediate bath sites, the
overall dynamics acting on the impurity site is non-Markovian.
  With the help of an optimization scheme for the auxiliary Lindblad
parameters, an accurate mapping is achieved, which becomes exponentially exact
upon increasing $N_B$. The basic idea for this scheme was presented previously
in the context of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory. In successive
works on improved manybody solution strategies for the auxiliary Lindblad
equation, such as Lanczos exact diagonalization or matrix product states, we
applied the approach to study the nonequilibrium Kondo regime.
  In the present paper, we address in detail the mapping procedure itself,
rather than the many-body solution. In particular, we investigate the effects
of the geometry of the auxiliary system on the accuracy of the mapping for
given $N_B$. Specifically, we present a detailed convergence study for five
different geometries which, besides being of practical utility, reveals
important insights into the underlying mechanisms of the mapping. For setups
with onsite or nearest-neighbor Lindblad parameters we find that a
representation adopting two separate bath chains is by far more accurate with
respect to other choices based on a single chain or a commonly used star
geometry. A significant improvement is obtained by allowing for long-ranged and
complex Lindblad parameters. These results can be of great value when studying
Lindblad-type approaches to correlated systems.

how a classical client can exploit the ambiguity in the flow of information in
measurement-based quantum computing to construct a protocol for hiding critical
aspects of a computation delegated to a remote quantum computer. This ambiguity
arises due to the fact that, for a fixed graph, there exist multiple choices of
the input and output vertex sets that result in deterministic measurement
patterns consistent with the same fixed total ordering of vertices. This allows
a classical user, computing only measurement angles, to drive a
measurement-based computation performed on a remote device while hiding

analytic continuations of the ADM mass and tensions of asymptotically planar
AdS spacetimes, and which measure the leading anisotropic corrections to the

'cosmological volume' contribution that is analogous to the thermodynamic

VIS-IR spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR
imaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. Disk-resolved observations
with a phase angle within the $7^{\circ}<\alpha<132^{\circ}$ interval were used
to characterize Ceres' phase curve in the 0.465-4.05 $\mu$m spectral range.
Hapke's model was applied to perform the photometric correction of the dataset,
allowing us to produce albedo and color maps of the surface. The $V$-band
magnitude phase function of Ceres was fitted with both the classical linear
model and H-G formalism. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry
parameter at 0.55$\mu$m are $w=0.14\pm0.02$ and $\xi=-0.11\pm0.08$,
respectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); the modeled geometric
albedo is $0.094\pm0.007$; the roughness parameter is
$\bar{\theta}=29^{\circ}\pm6^{\circ}$. Albedo maps indicate small variability
on a global scale with an average reflectance of $0.034 \pm 0.003$. Isolated
areas such as the Occator bright spots, Haulani, and Oxo show an albedo much
higher than average. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the
average spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is
$1.1\%k\AA^{-1}$ and $0.85\%k\AA^{-1}$ at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively.
Broadband color indices are $V-R=0.38\pm0.01$ and $R-I=0.33\pm0.02$. H-G
modeling of the $V$-band magnitude phase curve for $\alpha<30^{\circ}$ gives
$H=3.14\pm0.04$ and $G=0.10\pm0.04$, while the classical linear model provides
$V(1,1,0^{\circ})=3.48\pm0.03$ and $\beta=0.036\pm0.002$. The comparison with
spectrophotometric properties of other minor bodies indicates that Ceres has a
less back-scattering phase function and a slightly higher albedo than comets
and C-type objects. However, the latter represents the closest match in the
usual asteroid taxonomy.

tasks. Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples:
given an input $x$ and any target classification $t$, it is possible to find a
new input $x'$ that is similar to $x$ but classified as $t$. This makes it
difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive
distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural
network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current
attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from $95\%$ to $0.5\%$.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not
significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three
new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled
neural networks with $100\%$ probability. Our attacks are tailored to three
distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to
previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much
more effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence
adversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used
to break defensive distillation. We hope our attacks will be used as a
benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist
adversarial examples.

medical emergency care. Although medical best practice guidelines exist in
hospital handbooks, they are often lengthy and difficult to apply clinically.
The challenges are exaggerated for doctors in rural areas and emergency medical
technicians (EMT) during patient transport.
  In this paper, we propose the concept of distributed executable medical best
practice guidance systems to assist adherence to best practice from the time
that a patient first presents at a rural hospital, through diagnosis and
ambulance transfer to arrival and treatment at a regional tertiary hospital
center. We codify complex medical knowledge in the form of simplified
distributed executable disease automata, from the thin automata at rural
hospitals to the rich automata in the regional center hospitals. However, a
main challenge is how to efficiently and safely synchronize distributed best
practice models as the communication among medical facilities, devices, and
professionals generates a large number of messages. This complex problem of
patient diagnosis and transport from rural to center facility is also fraught
with many uncertainties and changes resulting in a high degree of dynamism. To
address this situation, we propose a pathophysiological model-driven message
exchange communication architecture that ensures the real-time and dynamic
requirements of synchronization among distributed emergency best-practice
models are met in a reliable and safe manner. Taking the signs, symptoms, and
progress of stroke patients transported across a geographically distributed
healthcare network as the motivating use case, we implement our communication
system and apply it to our developed best practice automata using laboratory
simulations. Our proof-of-concept experiments shows there is potential for the
use of our system in a wide variety of domains.

electors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of
electors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well
resolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive
-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,
electoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their
probabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no
fluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As
the quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with
it the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.
Rigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party
loyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing
the quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing
the quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties
at the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the
more concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.

assumed to be confined to a four dimensional space-time called the brane; the
brane is a slice through a higher dimensional space-time called the bulk. The
geometry of the ADD, Randall-Sundrum and DGP space-times is described and the
relation between Randall-Sundrum and Anti-de-Sitter space-time is explained.
The necessary differential geometry background is introduced in an appendix
that presumes no greater mathematical preparation than multivariable calculus.
The ordinary wave equation and the Klein-Gordon equation are briefly reviewed
followed by an analysis of the propagation of scalar waves in the bulk in all
three extra-dimensional models. We also calculate the scalar field produced by
a static point source located on the brane for all three models. For the ADD
and Randall-Sundrum models at large distances the field looks like that of a
point source in four space-time dimensions but at short distances it crosses
over to a form appropriate to the higher dimensional space-time. For the DGP
model the field has the higher dimensional form at long distances rather than
short. The scalar field results provide qualitative insights into the
corresponding behavior of gravitational fields. In particular the explanation
within the ADD and Randall-Sundrum model of the weakness of gravity compared to
other forces is discussed as are the implications of the two models for
colliders and other experiments.

The
Lorentz transformation implies differential simultaneity and light speed

distinguish the Lorentz transformation from a kinematically-similar alternate
transformation that predicts absolute simultaneity, the absolute Lorentz
transformation. Here, we describe how published optical tests of light speed
isotropy/anisotropy cannot distinguish between the two transformations. We show
that the shared equations of the two transformations, from the perspective of
the ""stationary"" observer, are sufficient to predict null results in optical
resonator experiments and in tests of frequency changes in one-way light paths.

described how a ""stationary"" observer would observe different clock readings

integral aspect of differential simultaneity. We derive the equation for the
difference in clock readings and show that it is equivalent to the Sagnac
correction that describes light speed anisotropies in satellite communications.
