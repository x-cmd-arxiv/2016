distributed minimization of an average of functions. The first algorithm is an
inexact variant of the DANE algorithm that allows any local algorithm to return
an approximate solution to a local subproblem. We show that such a strategy
does not affect the theoretical guarantees of DANE significantly. In fact, our
approach can be viewed as a robustification strategy since the method is
substantially better behaved than DANE on data partition arising in practice.
It is well known that DANE algorithm does not match the communication
complexity lower bounds. To bridge this gap, we propose an accelerated variant
of the first method, called AIDE, that not only matches the communication lower
bounds but can also be implemented using a purely first-order oracle. Our
empirical results show that AIDE is superior to other communication efficient
algorithms in settings that naturally arise in machine learning applications.

different null tetrads: the Newman-Unti and Szabados-Tod null tetrads, where
the peeling property is exhibited in the former but not the latter. Using these
asymptotic solutions, we discuss the mass-loss of an isolated
electro-gravitating system with cosmological constant. In a universe with
$\Lambda>0$, the physics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is relatively
straightforward compared to those of gravitational radiation: 1) It is clear
that outgoing EM radiation results in a decrease to the Bondi mass of the
isolated system. 2) It is also perspicuous that if any incoming EM radiation
from elsewhere is present, those beyond the isolated system's cosmological
horizon would eventually arrive at the spacelike $\mathcal{I}$ and increase the
Bondi mass of the isolated system. Hence, the (outgoing and incoming) EM
radiation fields do not couple with $\Lambda$ in the Bondi mass-loss formula in
an unusual manner, unlike the gravitational counterpart where outgoing
gravitational radiation induces non-conformal flatness of $\mathcal{I}$. These
asymptotic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-de Sitter equations presented here
may be used to extend a raft of existing results based on Newman-Unti's

$\mu + \phi\mu^p$, where $\mu$ is the mean, $\phi$ and $p$ are the dispersion
and Tweedie power parameters, respectively. The models are fitted by using an
estimating function approach obtained by combining the quasi-score and Pearson
estimating functions for estimation of the regression and dispersion
parameters, respectively. This provides a flexible and efficient regression
methodology for a comprehensive family of count models including Hermite,
Neyman Type A, P\'olya-Aeppli, negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian.
The estimating function approach allows us to extend the Poisson-Tweedie
distributions to deal with underdispersed count data by allowing negative
values for the dispersion parameter $\phi$. Furthermore, the Poisson-Tweedie
family can automatically adapt to highly skewed count data with excessive
zeros, without the need to introduce zero-inflated or hurdle components, by the
simple estimation of the power parameter. Thus, the proposed models offer a
unified framework to deal with under, equi, overdispersed, zero-inflated and
heavy-tailed count data. The computational implementation of the proposed
models is fast, relying only on a simple Newton scoring algorithm. Simulation
studies showed that the estimating function approach provides unbiased and
consistent estimators for both regression and dispersion parameters. We
highlight the ability of the Poisson-Tweedie distributions to deal with count
data through a consideration of dispersion, zero-inflated and heavy tail

using the Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi tessellation giving
rise to a system of discrete cells interacting through shared facets. For each
Voronoi cell, the displacement field is approximated on the basis of rigid body
kinematics, which is used to compute a strain vector at the centroid of the
Voronoi facets. Such strain vector is demonstrated to be the projection of the
strain tensor at that location. At the same point stress tractions are computed
through vectorial constitutive equations derived on the basis of classical
continuum tensorial theories. Results of analysis of a cantilever beam are used
to perform convergence studies and comparison with classical finite element
formulations in the elastic regime. Furthermore, cohesive fracture and
fragmentation of homogeneous solids are studied under quasi-static and dynamic
loading conditions. The mesh dependency problem, typically encountered upon
adopting softening constitutive equations, is tackled through the crack band
approach. This study demonstrates the capabilities of DCM by solving multiple
benchmark problems relevant to cohesive crack propagation. The simulations show
that DCM can handle effectively a wide range of problems from the simulation of

fractures are incorporated with a cross-flow equilibrium approach. This is the
first investigation of all-implicit higher-order MHFE-DG for unstructured

fractures. A lowest-order implicit finite volume (FV) transport update is also
developed for the same grid types. The implicit methods are compared to an
Implicit-Pressure-Explicit-Composition (IMPEC) scheme. For fractured domains,
the unconditionally stable implicit transport update is shown to increase
computational efficiency by orders of magnitude as compared to IMPEC, which has
a time-step constraint proportional to the pore volume of discrete fracture
grid cells. However, when lowest-order Euler time-discretizations are used,
numerical errors increase linearly with the larger implicit time-steps,

MHFE-DG and MHFE-FV are therefore presented as well. Convergence analyses show
twice the convergence rate for the DG methods as compared to FV, resulting in

Historically, reproducibility has followed the familiar Popperian [38] model
whereby theory cannot be verified by scientific testing, it can only be
falsified. Ultimately, this implies that if an experiment cannot be reproduced
independently to some satisfactory level of precision, its value is essentially
unquantifiable; put brutally, it is impossible to determine its scientific
value. The burgeoning presence of software in most scientific work adds a new
and particularly opaque layer of complexity [29]. In spite of much recent
interest in many scientific areas, emphasis remains more on procedures,
strictures and discussion [12, 14, 16, 29, 30, 37, 41], reflecting the
inexperience of most scientific journals when it comes to software, rather than
the details of how computational reproducibility is actually achieved, for
which there appear to be relatively few guiding examples [6, 10, 17]. After
considering basic principles, here we show how full computational
reproducibility can be achieved in practice at every stage using a case study

this paper, we investigate a quantization scheme in which the short distance

machine learning tasks but their demand on resources in terms of memory and
computational power are often high. Therefore, there is a great interest in
optimizing the computations performed with these models especially when
considering development of specialized low-power hardware for deep networks.
One way of reducing the computational needs is to limit the numerical precision
of the network weights and biases. This has led to different proposed rounding
methods which have been applied so far to only Convolutional Neural Networks
and Fully-Connected Networks. This paper addresses the question of how to best
reduce weight precision during training in the case of RNNs. We present results
from the use of different stochastic and deterministic reduced precision
training methods applied to three major RNN types which are then tested on
several datasets. The results show that the weight binarization methods do not
work with the RNNs. However, the stochastic and deterministic ternarization,
and pow2-ternarization methods gave rise to low-precision RNNs that produce
similar and even higher accuracy on certain datasets therefore providing a path
towards training more efficient implementations of RNNs in specialized

Proxima Centauri. The aim is to examine how the formation scenarios differ in
their predictions for the multiplicity of the Proxima system, the
water/volatile content of Proxima b and its orbital eccentricity, so that these
can be tested by future observations. A scenario of in situ formation via giant
impacts from a locally enhanced disc of planetary embryos/planetesimals
predicts that Proxima b will be in a multiplanet system with a measurably
finite eccentricity. Assuming that the local solid enhancement needed to form a
Proxima b analogue arises because of the inwards drift of solids in the form of
small planetesimals/boulders, this scenario also results in Proxima b analogues
being only moderately endowed with water/volatiles. A scenario in which
multiple embryos form, migrate and mutually collide within a gas disc results
in Proxima b being a member of a multiple system, possibly displaying mean
motion resonances, but where the constituent members are Ocean planets due to
accretion occurring mainly outside of the snowline. A scenario in which a
single accreting embryo forms outside the snowline, and migrates inwards while
accreting planetesimals/pebbles results in Proxima b being an isolated Ocean
planet on a circular orbit. A scenario in which Proxima b formed via pebble
accretion interior to the snowline produces a dry planet on a circular orbit.
Future observations that characterise the physical and orbital properties of
Proxima b, and any additional planets in the system, will provide valuable
insights into the formation history of this neighbouring planetary system.

collapse. Inclusion of higher-order interactions, present in the full

probability that Proxima Centauri has had encounters with its companion stars,
Alpha Centauri A and B, that are close enough to destabilize an extended
planetary system. If the system has an additional planet, as suggested by the
discovery data, then it may perturb planet b's eccentricity and inclination,
possibly driving those parameters to non-zero values, even in the presence of
strong tidal damping. We also model the internal evolution of the planet,
evaluating the roles of different radiogenic abundances and tidal heating and
find that magnetic field generation is likely for billions of years. We find
that if planet b formed in situ, then it experienced 169 +/- 13 million years
in a runaway greenhouse as the star contracted during its formation. This early
phase could remove up to 5 times as much water as in the modern Earth's oceans,
possibly producing a large abiotic oxygen atmosphere. On the other hand, if
Proxima Centauri b formed with a substantial hydrogen atmosphere (0.01 - 1% of
the planet's mass), then this envelope could have shielded the water long
enough for it to be retained before being blown off itself. After modeling this
wide range of processes we conclude that water retention during the host star's
pre-main sequence phase is the biggest obstacle for Proxima b's habitability.

nT per resolution-limited point ($\sim$2 $\mu$m), or 6 nT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$
per point at its duty cycle. Compared to point-by-point sensors, the long
length of the BEC provides a naturally parallel measurement, allowing one to
measure nearly one-hundred points with an effective field sensitivity of 600
pT$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for each point during the same time as a point-by-point
scanner would measure these points sequentially. Moreover, it has a noise floor
of 300 pT and provides nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in magnetic
flux sensitivity (down to $10^{-6}$ $\Phi_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) over previous
atomic probe magnetometers capable of scanning near samples. These capabilities
are, for the first time, carefully benchmarked by imaging magnetic fields
arising from microfabricated wire patterns, in a system where samples may be
scanned, cryogenically cooled, and easily exchanged. The SQCRAMscope will

the latter involves an adjusting of computational parameters through the visual
comparisons between the experimental light interference pattern or a
$^{2}H-NMR$ spectral pattern produced by an escaped-radial disclination, and
their computational simulation counterparts. To avoid such comparisons, we
develop an algebraic method for obtaining of saddle-splay elastic constant
$K_{24}$. Considering an escaped-radial disclination inside a capillary tube
with radius $R_{0}$ of tens of micrometers, we use a metric approach to study
the propagation of the light (in the scalar wave approximation), near to the
surface of the tube and to determine the light interference pattern due to the
defect. The latter is responsible for the existence of a well-defined
interference peak associated to a unique angle $\phi_{0}$. Since this angle
depends on factors such as refractive indexes, curvature elastic constants,
anchoring regime, surface anchoring strength and radius $R_{0}$, the
measurement of $\phi_{0}$ from the interference experiments involving two
different radii allows us to algebraically retrieve $K_{24}$. Our method
allowed us to give the first reported estimation of $K_{24}$ for the lyotropic

to be very active, flaring frequently and causing UV fluxes on the surfaces of

life (e.g. living underground, or underwater) would make a biosphere harder to

safer wavelengths, could increase a biosphere's detectability. Here we model
intermittent emission at specific wavelengths in the visible spectrum caused by
biofluorescence as a new temporal biosignature for planets around active M
stars. We use the absorption and emission characteristics of common coral
fluorescent pigments and proteins to create model spectra and colours for an
Earth-like planet in such a system, accounting for different surface features,
atmospheric absorption, and cloud cover. We find that for a cloud-free planet
biofluorescence could induce a temporary change in brightness that is
significantly higher than the reflected flux alone, causing up to two
orders-of-magnitude change in planet-star contrast, compared to a
non-fluorescent state, if the surface is fully covered by a highly efficient
fluorescent biosphere. Hence, UV-flare induced biofluorescence presents
previously unexplored possibilities for a new temporal biosignature that could
be detectable by instruments like those planned for the extremely large

idea behind harmonic replacement dates back to Schwarz and Perron. The
technique, as introduced by Jost and further developed by Colding and
Minicozzi, involves taking a map $v\colon\Sigma\to M$ defined on a surface
$\Sigma$ and replacing its values on a small ball $B^2\subset\Sigma$ with a
harmonic map $u$ that has the same values as $v$ on the boundary $\partial
B^2$. The resulting map on $\Sigma$ has lower energy, and repeating this
process on balls covering $\Sigma$, one can obtain a global harmonic map in the
limit. We develop the analogous procedure in the gauge theory context. We take
a connection $B$ on a bundle over a four-manifold $X$, and replace it on a
small ball $B^4\subset X$ with a Yang--Mills connection $A$ that has the same
restriction to the boundary $\partial B^4$ as $B$. As in the harmonic
replacement results of Colding and Minicozzi, we have bounds on the difference
$\lVert B-A\rVert_{L^2_1(X)}^2$ in terms of the drop in energy, and we only
require that the connection $B$ have small energy on the ball, rather than
small $C^0$ oscillation. Throughout, we work with connections of the lowest
possible regularity $L^2_1(X)$, the natural choice for this context, and so our
gauge transformations are in $L^2_2(X)$ and therefore almost but not quite
continuous, leading to more delicate arguments than in higher regularity.

$10^{14}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$ and redshift between 0.2 and 0.5, comparing with
observational results and subhalo detections in early-type galaxy lenses. We
compare the number and the spatial distribution of subhaloes in the fully hydro

between the two simulations. We find that the presence of baryons reduces the
number of subhaloes, especially at the low mass end ($\leq

variations in the subhalo mass function are strongly dependent on those in the
halo mass function, which is shifted by the effect of stellar and AGN feedback.
Finally, we search for analogues of the observed lenses (SLACS) in the

use the selected galaxies to quantify detection expectations based on the

probability and the predicted values for the projected dark matter fraction in
subhaloes $f_{DM}$ and the slope of the mass function $\alpha$. We compare

However, spectral evidence that MACS0647-JD lies at high redshift has proven
infeasible and so here we seek an independent lensing based ""geometric
redshift"" derived from the angles between the three lensed images of
MACS0647-JD, using our free-form mass model (WSLAP+) for the lensing cluster
MACSJ0647.7+7015 (at $z=0.591$). Our lens model uses the 9 sets of multiple
images, including those of MACS0647-JD, identified by the CLASH survey towards
this cluster. We convincingly exclude the low redshift regime of $z<3$, for
which convoluted critical curves are generated by our method, as the solution
bends to accommodate the wide angles of MACS0647-JD for this low redshift.
Instead, a best fit to all sets of lensed galaxy positions and redshifts
provides a geometric redshift of $z\simeq 10.8^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ for MACS0647-JD,
strongly supporting the higher photometric redshift solution. Importantly, we
find a tight linear relation between the relative brightnesses of all 9 sets of
multiply lensed images and their relative magnifications as predicted by our
model. This agreement provides a benchmark for the quality of the lens model,
and establishes the robustness of our free-form lensing method for measuring
model-independent geometric source distances and for deriving objective central
cluster mass distributions. After correcting for its magnification the
luminosity of MACS0647-JD remains relatively high at $M_{UV}=-19.4$, which is
within a factor of a few in flux of some surprisingly luminous $z\simeq
10$--$11$ candidates discovered recently in Hubble black field surveys.

reveals a rich phase structure owing to anomalous breaking of a classical
symmetry, which maps the scale factor $a\mapsto\lambda a$ for some constant
$\lambda$. In the weak coupling ($\omega$) limit, the theory goes from a
symmetry preserving phase to a broken phase. The existence of phase boundary is
an obstruction to another classical symmetry [arXiv:gr-qc/9902083] (which
relates two BD theory with different coupling) admitted by BD theory with scale
invariant matter content i.e $T^{\mu}{}_{\mu}=0$. Classically, this prohibits
the BD theory to reduce to General Relativity (GR) for scale invariant matter
content. We show that strong coupling limit of BD and GR both preserves the
symmetry involving scale factor. We also show that with a scale invariant
matter content (radiation i.e $P=\frac{1}{3}\rho$), the quantized BD theory
does reduce to GR as $\omega\rightarrow\infty$, which is in sharp contrast to
classical behavior. This is a first known illustration of a scenario, where
quantized BD theory provides example of anomalous symmetry breaking and
resulting binary phase structure. We make a conjecture regarding strong

interstellar dust and an intrinsic variable component. The intrinsic optical
polarization, detected during the rise of one of the brightest flares of the

present several arguments that favour a synchrotron jet origin to this variable
polarization, with the optical emission originating close to the jet base. The
polarization flare occurs during the initial rise of a major radio flare event
that peaks later, and is consistent with a classically evolving synchrotron
flare from an ejection event. We conclude that the optical polarization flare
represents a jet launching event; the birth of a major ejection. For this event
we measure a rather stable polarization position angle of -9 degrees E of N,
implying that the magnetic field near the base of the jet is approximately
perpendicular to the jet axis. This may be due to the compression of magnetic
field lines in shocks in the accelerated plasma, resulting in a partially
ordered transverse field that have now been seen during the 2015 outburst. We
also find that this ejection occurred at a similar stage in the repetitive
cycles of flares.

that the synchrotron emission is polarized at a level of 8.0 +- 2.5 per cent (a

interstellar dust along the line of sight, scattering within the system, and an
additional source that changes the polarization position angle in the reddest

measure an excess of ~ 1.25 +- 0.28 per cent polarization and a position angle
of the magnetic field vector that is consistent with being parallel with the

representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time--dependent noise or
evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure
behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for
the `entanglement tsunami' in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show
that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to
the celebrated Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement
grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like $(\text{time})^{1/3}$ and
are spatially correlated over a distance $\propto (\text{time})^{2/3}$. We
derive KPZ universal behaviour in three complementary ways, by mapping random
entanglement growth to: (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface; (ii) a
`minimal cut' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu--Takayanagi formula in
holography; and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading
of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using
simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading order time
dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise,
allowing us to propose a simple `minimal cut' picture for the entanglement
growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary
dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the `velocity' of entanglement growth
in the 1D `entanglement tsunami'. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy
entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a

as a consistency requirement for effective field theories (EFTs), it rules out
possibilities for model-building including some models of inflation. I
demonstrate simple models which satisfy all forms of the WGC, but which through
Higgsing of the original gauge fields produce low-energy EFTs with gauge forces
that badly violate the WGC. These models illustrate specific loopholes in
arguments that motivate the WGC from a bottom-up perspective; for example the
arguments based on magnetic monopoles are evaded when the magnetic confinement
that occurs in a Higgs phase is accounted for. This indicates that the WGC
should not be taken as a veto on EFTs, even if it turns out to be a robust
property of UV quantum gravity theories. However, if the latter is true then
parametric violation of the WGC at low energy comes at the cost of non-minimal
field content in the UV. I propose that only a very weak constraint is
applicable to EFTs, $\Lambda \lesssim \left(-\log g \right)^{-1/2} M_\text{pl}$

produced by Higgsing a theory that satisfies the WGC can saturate but not

special state node designated as ""interval state node""; and an interval length
probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which represents the length of

the angular momentum transport in these systems. The best case to date is that
of HL~Tau, where the inability to produce a good fit to the 1.25-mm data with a
combination of vertical and azimuthal magnetic field components was interpreted
as implying that centrifugally driven winds (CDWs) are probably not a
significant transport mechanism on the $\sim 10^2\,$au scale probed by the
observations. Using synthetic polarization maps of heuristic
single-field-component discs and of a post-processed simulation of a
wind-driving disc, we demonstrate that a much better fit to the data can be
obtained if the radial field component, a hallmark of the CDW mechanism,
dominates in the polarized emission region. A similar inference was previously
made in modelling the far-infrared polarization map of the pc-scale dust ring
in the Galactic centre. To reconcile this interpretation with theoretical
models of protostellar discs, which indicate that the wind is launched from a
comparatively high elevation above the mid-plane, we propose that most of the
polarized emission originates -- with a high ($\ga 10$\%) intrinsic degree of
polarization -- in small ($\la 0.1\,$mm) grains that remain suspended above the
mid-plane, and that the bulk of the mm-wavelength emission is produced -- with
low intrinsic polarization -- by larger grains that have settled to the
mid-plane.

satisfy the Markov branching property, which is fulfilled by a wide range of
models. Loosely, this property entails that given the sizes of the sub-trees
above the root, these sub-trees are independent and their distributions only
depend upon their respective sizes. The laws of the elements of a Markov
branching family are characterised by a sequence of probability distributions
on the sets of integer partitions which describes how the sizes of the
sub-trees above the root are distributed.
  We prove that under some natural assumption on this sequence of
probabilities, when their sizes go to infinity, the trees converge in
distribution to an infinite tree which also satisfies the Markov branching
property. Furthermore, when this infinite tree has a single path from the root
to infinity, we give conditions to ensure its convergence in distribution under
appropriate rescaling of its distance and counting measure to a self-similar
fragmentation tree with immigration. In particular, this allows us to determine
how, in this infinite tree, the ""volume"" of the ball of radius $R$ centred at
the root asymptotically grows with $R$.
  Our unified approach will allow us to develop various new applications, in
particular to different models of growing trees and cut-trees, and to recover
known results. An illustrative example lies in the study of Galton-Watson
trees: the distribution of a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned on its
size converges to that of Kesten's tree when the size grows to infinity. If
furthermore, the offspring distribution has finite variance, under adequate
rescaling, Kesten's tree converges to Aldous' self-similar CRT and the total
size of the $R$ first generations asymptotically behaves like $R^2$.

compact with high packing densities in the folded states. It is known that
proteins unfold upon addition of denaturants, adopting random coil structures.
The dependence of the radii of gyration on protein size in the folded and
unfolded states obeys the same scaling laws as synthetic polymers. Thus, one
might surmise that the mechanism of collapse in proteins and polymers ought to
be similar. However, because the number of amino acids in single domain
proteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been
resolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that
favor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By
adopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the
propensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and
is encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over
2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\beta$-sheets have greater tendency
to be compact than $\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into
the reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis
for the origin of multi-domain proteins. Application to non-coding RNA
molecules show that they have evolved to collapse sharing similarities to
$\beta$-sheet proteins. An implication of our theory is that the evolution of
natural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient
folding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding
conditions. This concept also supports the compaction selection hypothesis used
to rationalize the unusually condensed states of viral RNA molecules.

  The proposed reconstruction framework addresses the reconstruction accuracy,
noise propagation and computation time for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting
(MRF).
  Methods
  Based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the signal evolution, MRF is
formulated as a low rank inverse problem in which one image is reconstructed
for each singular value under consideration. This low rank approximation of the
signal evolution reduces the computational burden by reducing the number of
Fourier transformations. Also, the low rank approximation improves the
conditioning of the problem, which is further improved by extending the low
rank inverse problem to an augmented Lagrangian that is solved by the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The root mean square error
and the noise propagation are analyzed in simulations. For verification, in
vivo examples are provided.
  Results
  The proposed low rank ADMM approach shows a reduced root mean square error
compared to the original fingerprinting reconstruction, to a low rank
approximation alone and to an ADMM approach without a low rank approximation.
Incorporating sensitivity encoding allows for further artifact reduction.
  Conclusion
  The proposed reconstruction provides robust convergence, reduced
computational burden and improved image quality compared to other MRF
reconstruction approaches evaluated in this study.

satisfy some regular variation condition which ensures that their fourth moment
is infinite. In this case, Soshnikov [31, 32] and Auffinger et al. [2] proved
the weak convergence of the point processes of the normalized eigenvalues of
the sample covariance matrix towards an inhomogeneous Poisson process which
implies in turn that the largest eigenvalue converges in distribution to a
Fr\'echet distributed random variable. They proved these results under the
assumption that $p$ and $n$ are proportional to each other. In this paper we
show that the aforementioned results remain valid if $p$ grows at any

large deviation techniques to achieve them. The proofs reveal that only the
diagonal of the sample covariance matrix is relevant for the asymptotic
behavior of the largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors which
are close to the canonical basis vectors. We also discuss extensions of the

developments since the first observation of topologically ordered states in

question: How much detail of the physics of topological orders can in principle
be observed using state of the art technologies? We find that using
surprisingly little data, namely the toric code Hamiltonian in the presence of
generic disorders and detuning from its exactly solvable point, the modular
matrices -- characterizing anyonic statistics that are some of the most
fundamental finger prints of topological orders -- can be reconstructed with
very good accuracy solely by experimental means. This is a first experimental
realization of these fundamental signatures of a topological order, a test of
their robustness against perturbations, and a proof of principle -- that
current technologies have attained the precision to identify phases of matter
and, as such, probe an extended region of phase space around the soluble point
before its breakdown. Given the special role of anyonic statistics in quantum
computation, our work promises myriad applications both in probing and
realistically harnessing these exotic phases of matter.

it occurs for a larger range of parameters. Going forward from here, we expect

these winds play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of
protoplanetary material.
  LVC emission is seen in all 30 stars with detected [O I] but only in 2 out of

rates and their luminosity is correlated with the accretion luminosity, but the
NC is proportionately stronger than the BC in transition disks.

around Swift~J1834.9$-$0846. We study this magnetar's global energetics and the
properties of its particle wind or outflows. At a distance of $\sim4\;$kpc,
Swift~J1834.9$-$0846 is located at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR)
W41 whose radius is $\sim 19\;$pc, an order of magnitude larger than that of
the X-ray nebula ($\sim2\;$pc). The association with SNR W41 suggests a common
age of $\sim5-100\;$kyr, while its spin-down age is $4.9$~kyr. A small natal
kick velocity may partly explain why a wind nebula was detected around this
magnetar but not around other magnetars, most of which appear to have larger
kick velocities and may have exited their birth SNR. We find that the GeV and
TeV source detected by Fermi/LAT and H.E.S.S., respectively, of radius
$\sim11\;$pc is most likely of hadronic origin. The dynamics and internal
structure of the nebula are examined analytically to explain the nebula's
current properties. Its size may naturally correspond to the
diffusion-dominated cooling length of the X-ray emitting $e^+e^-$ pairs. This
may also account for the spectral softening of the X-ray emission from the
nebula's inner to outer parts. Analysis of the X-ray synchrotron nebula implies
that (i) the nebular magnetic field is $\gtrsim 11\;\mu$G (and likely
$\lesssim30\;\mu$G), and (ii) the nebula is not powered predominantly by the
magnetar's quiescent spin-down-powered MHD wind, but by other outflows that
contribute most of its energy. The latter are most likely associated with the
magnetar's bursting activity, and possibly dominated by outflows associated
with its past giant flares. The energy source for the required outflows cannot
be the decay of the magnetar's dipole field alone, and is most likely the decay
of its much stronger internal magnetic field.

use of related information from multiple representations of the data. It
becomes important nowadays because more and more data can be collected in a
variety of ways, in different settings and from different sources, so each data
set can be represented by different sets of features to form different views of
it. Many approaches have been proposed to improve clustering performance by
exploring and integrating heterogeneous information underlying different views.
In this paper, we propose a new multi-view fuzzy clustering approach called
MinimaxFCM by using minimax optimization based on well-known Fuzzy c means. In
MinimaxFCM the consensus clustering results are generated based on minimax
optimization in which the maximum disagreements of different weighted views are
minimized. Moreover, the weight of each view can be learned automatically in
the clustering process. In addition, there is only one parameter to be set
besides the fuzzifier. The detailed problem formulation, updating rules

fluctuations in the ionized gas of the Orion Nebula, we apply a variety of
statistical techniques to observed velocity cubes. The cubes are derived from
high resolving power ($R \approx 40,000$) longslit spectroscopy of optical
emission lines that span a range of ionizations. From Velocity Channel Analysis
(VCA), we find that the slope of the velocity power spectrum is consistent with
predictions of Kolmogorov theory between scales of 8 and 22 arcsec (0.02 to
0.05 pc). The outer scale, which is the dominant scale of density fluctuations
in the nebula, approximately coincides with the autocorrelation length of the
velocity fluctuations that we determine from the second order velocity
structure function. We propose that this is the principal driving scale of the
turbulence, which originates in the autocorrelation length of dense cores in
the Orion molecular filament. By combining analysis of the non-thermal line
widths with the systematic trends of velocity centroid versus ionization, we
find that the global champagne flow and smaller scale turbulence each
contribute in equal measure to the total velocity dispersion, with respective
root-mean-square widths of 4-5 km/s. The turbulence is subsonic and can account
for only one half of the derived variance in ionized density, with the
remaining variance provided by density gradients in photoevaporation flows from
globules and filaments. Intercomparison with results from simulations implies
that the ionized gas is confined to a thick shell and does not fill the

ambient pressure reveal the onset of coherence at $T^*\approx 20\,$K and
non-Fermi liquid behavior with linear temperature dependence over a decade in

lowering temperature between 10 K and 2 K and reaches 800 mJ/mol K$^2$ at 1 K,
suggesting that CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ is a heavy fermion compound in the close
vicinity of a quantum critical point. Resistivity measurements under pressure
further confirm the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a large temperature-pressure
range. The magnetic susceptibility is found to follow the typical behavior for
a one-dimensional (1D) spin chain from 300 K down to $T^*$, and
first-principles calculations predict flat Fermi surfaces for the itinerant
$f$-electron bands. These suggest that CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ is a rare example of the

important information about the objects in our surroundings. In this work, we

visual models. To demonstrate this, we train a convolutional neural network to
predict a statistical summary of the sound associated with a video frame. We
show that, through this process, the network learns a representation that
conveys information about objects and scenes. We evaluate this representation

through visualizations that the network learns units that are selective to
objects that are often associated with characteristic sounds.

solutions of the 2D Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory obtained by a circle
reduction from 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant. This specific
model ensures that the dual theory has a well defined ultraviolet completion in
terms of a 2D CFT, but our results apply qualitatively to a wider class of 2D
dilaton gravity theories. For each type of solutions we perform holographic
renormalization, compute the exact renormalized one-point functions in the
presence of arbitrary sources, and derive the asymptotic symmetries and
conserved charges. In both cases we find that the scalar operator dual to the
dilaton plays a crucial role in the description of the dynamics. Its source
gives rise to a matter conformal anomaly for the running dilaton solutions,
while its expectation value is the only non trivial observable for constant
dilaton solutions. The role of this operator has been largely overlooked in the
literature. We further show that the only non trivial conserved charges for
running dilaton solutions are the mass and the electric charge, while for
constant dilaton solutions only the electric charge is non zero. However, by
uplifting the solutions to three dimensions we show that constant dilaton
solutions can support non trivial extended symmetry algebras, including the one
found by Comp\`ere, Song and Strominger, in agreement with results by Castro
and Song. Finally, we demonstrate that any solution of this specific dilaton
gravity model can be uplifted to a family of asymptotically AdS$_2\times S^2$
or conformally AdS$_2\times S^2$ solutions of the STU model in four dimensions.
The four dimensional solutions obtained by uplifting the running dilaton
solutions coincide with the so called `subtracted geometries', while those
obtained from the uplift of the constant dilaton ones are new.

systematic uncertainty of 1.5\% and a background flux uncertainty of 4\%. A
simple deadtime-corrected Poisson noise level spectrum matches well with the
observed high frequency power spectra till 50 kHz and as expected the data show
no significant high frequency ($> 20$ Hz) features. Energy dependent power
spectra reveal a strong low frequency (2 - 8 Hz) Quasi-periodic oscillation

rapidly with flux (nearly 4 Hz in ~ 5 hours). With increasing QPO frequency, an
excess noise component appears significantly in the high energy regime (> 8
keV). At the QPO frequencies, the time-lag as a function of energy has a
non-monotonic behavior such that the lags decrease with energy till about 15
-20 keV and then increase for higher energies. These first look results
benchmark the performance of LAXPC at high energies and confirms that its data

multi-delayed prey-predator model with prey refuge. We consider modified
Holling Type II response function that incorporates the effect of prey refuge
and then introduce two discrete delays in the model system. A negative feedback
delay is considered in the logistic prey growth rate to represent density
dependent feedback mechanism and a positive feedback delay is considered to
represent the gestation time of the predator. Our study reveals that the system
exhibits different dynamical behaviors, viz., stable coexistence, periodic
coexistence or chaos depending on the values of the delay parameters and degree
of prey refuge. The interplay between two delays for a fixed value of prey
refuge has also been determined. It is noticed that these delays work in a
complementary fashion. In addition, using the normal form theory and center
manifold argument, we derive the explicit formulae for determining the
direction of the bifurcation, the stability and other properties of the
bifurcating periodic solutions.

We elucidate the role of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in determining the
extrinsic chirality and we verify the results by using finite-difference
time-domain simulation. Our results have indicated the outgoing reflection
arises from the interference between the nonresonant background, which
preserves the input polarization, and the SPP radiation damping, which is
linearly polarized but carries a different polarization defined by the
vectorial field of SPPs. More importantly, the interference manifests various
polarization states ranging from linear to elliptical across the SPP resonance.
We analytically formulate the outgoing waves based on temporal coupled mode
theory (CMT) and the results agree well with the experiment and simulation.
From CMT, we find the polarization conversion depends on the interplay between
the absorption and radiative decay rates of SPPs and the sample orientation.

of a slight decrease in the system reliability. In this context, this paper
studies the system reliability, fault tolerance and design metrics tradeoffs in
the DMMR scheme compared to the NMR scheme when the majority logic group of the
DMMR scheme is increased in size relative to the minority logic group. Some
example DMMR and NMR systems were realized using a 32/28nm CMOS process and
compared. The results show that 5-of-M DMMR systems have a similar or better
fault tolerance whilst requiring similar or fewer function modules than their
counterpart NMR systems and simultaneously achieve optimizations in design
metrics. Nevertheless, 3-of-M DMMR systems have the upper hand with respect to
fault tolerance and design metrics optimizations than the comparable NMR and
5-of-M DMMR systems. With regard to system reliability, NMR systems are closely
followed by 5-of-M DMMR systems which are closely followed by 3-of-M DMMR

magnesium. It is based on a hard-sphere assumption previously used for
martensitic transformations. The atomic displacements are established, and the
homogeneous lattice distortion is analytically expressed as a continuous
angular-distortive matrix that takes the usual form of shear when the
distortion is complete. The calculations prove that a volume change of 3
percents occurs for the intermediate states and that the twinning plane, even
if untilted and restored when the distortion is complete, is not fully
invariant during the transient states. The crystallographic calculations also
show that the (90 deg, a) twins observed in magnesium nano-pillars and the (86
deg, a) twins observed in bulk samples come from the same mechanism, the only
difference being the existence of a slight obliquity angle (+/- 3.4 deg)
required to reduce the strains in the latter case. Continuous features in the
pole figures between the low-misoriented (86 deg, a) twin variants are
expected; they are confirmed by EBSD maps acquired on a deformed magnesium
single crystal. As the continuous mechanism of extension twinning is not a
simple shear, a ""virtual work"" criterion using the value of the intermediate
distortion matrix at the maximum volume change is proposed in place of the
usual Schmid's law. It allows predicting the formation of extension twins for
crystal orientations associated with negative Schmid factors.

to an increase or decrease of semi-major axis depending on its functional form

combined effects of solar wind and photon absorption and re-emmision
(Poynting-Robertson drag) lead to a decrease in semi-major axis on secular time

have been performed with the VLT/ MUSE spectrograph in the wavelength region

studying chemical abundances, the star formation history (SFH) and the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) as a function of galacto-centric distance.
Different, independent ways to analyse the stellar populations result in a
luminosity-weighted age of $\sim$ 6 Gyr and a metallicity [Fe/H]$\sim$ $-0.4$,
similar to other dEs of similar mass. We find unusually overabundant values of
[Ca/Fe] $\sim +0.1$, and under-abundant Sodium, with [Na/Fe] values around
$-0.1$, while [Mg/Fe] is overabundant at all radii, increasing from $\sim+0.1$
in the centre to $\sim +0.2$ dex. We notice a significant metallicity and age
gradient within this dwarf galaxy. To constrain the stellar IMF of NGC 1396, we
find that the IMF of NGC 1396 is consistent with either a Kroupa-like or a
top-heavy distribution, while a bottom-heavy IMF is firmly ruled out. An
analysis of the abundance ratios, and a comparison with galaxies in the Local
Group, shows that the chemical enrichment history of NGC 1396 is similar to the
Galactic disc, with an extended star formation history. This would be the case
if the galaxy originated from a LMC-sized dwarf galaxy progenitor, which would
lose its gas while falling into the Fornax cluster.

regularisation, this algorithm converges rapidly and produces results robust
against experimental noise. This method has been called PALMA. It is able to
reproduce faithfully monodisperse as well as polydisperse systems, and numerous
simulated and experimental examples are presented. It has been implemented on

of extended and misaligned lobes, which suggest a rapid realignment of the jet
axis, for which a potential cause is still under debate. Here we analyse the
complex radio structure of 3C 293 winged source hosted by the post-merger
galaxy, which uniquely displays a significant asymmetry between the sizes of
the two pairs of lobes, indicating that an episode of jet realignment took
place only very recently. Based on all the available radio data for 3C 293, we
have performed a detailed spectral modelling for the older and younger lobes in
the system. In this way we derived the lobes' ages and jet energetics, which we
then compared to the accretion power in the source. We found that the 200
kpc-scale outer lobes of 3C 293 are ~60 Myr old and that jet activity related
to the formation of the outer lobes ceased within the last Myr. Meanwhile, the
inner 4 kpc-scale lobes, tilted by ~40 deg with respect to the outer ones, are
only about ~0.3 Myr old. The best model fits also return identical values of
the jet power supplying the outer and the inner structures. This power is of
the order of the maximum kinetic luminosity of a Blandford-Znajek jet for a
given black hole mass and accretion rate, but only in the case of relatively
low values of a black hole spin, a~0.2. The derived jet energetics and
timescales, along with the presence of two optical nuclei in 3C 293, all
provide a strong support to the Lense-Thirring precession model in which the
supermassive black hole spin, and therefore the jet axis, flips rapidly owing
to the interactions with the tilted accretion disk in a new tidal interaction
episode of the merging process. We further speculate that, in general, X-shape
radio morphology forms in post-merger systems that are rich in cold molecular
gas, and only host slowly spinning supermassive black holes.

First, we make video captioners highlight sensitive by priming them with a

diversity in video captioners, so that the generated titles are also diverse
and catchy. This means that a large number of sentences might be required to
learn the sentence structure of titles. Hence, we propose a novel sentence
augmentation method to train a captioner with additional sentence-only examples
that come without corresponding videos. We collected a large-scale Video Titles

equation of the first kind, frequently appearing in many fields of
astrophysics, physics, chemistry, and applied sciences. This equation
represents an ill-posed problem, thus solving it requires some kind of
regularization. Our method is based on solving the equation on a so-called
compact set of functions and/or using Tikhonov's regularization. A priori
constraints on the unknown function, defining a compact set, are very loose and
can be set using simple physical considerations. Tikhonov's regularization on
itself does not require any explicit a priori constraints on the unknown
function and can be used independently of such constraints or in combination
with them. Various target degrees of smoothness of the unknown function may be
set, as required by the problem at hand. The advantage of the method, apart
from its flexibility, is that it gives uniform convergence of the approximate
solution to the exact solution, as the errors of input data tend to zero. The
method is illustrated on several simulated models with known solutions. An
example of astrophysical application of the method is also given.

nonstrange and strange counterparts since they have only one light quark and,
thus, their decay involves producing either a light meson and doubly strange
baryon or both meson and baryon with strangeness which involves, relatively,
more energy. In fact, some $\Xi$'s have full widths of the order of even 10-20
MeV when, in principle, they have a large phase space to decay to some open
channels. Such is the case of $\Xi (1690)$, for which the width has been found
to be of the order of 10 MeV in the latest {\it BABAR} and BELLE data. In this
manuscript we study why some $\Xi$'s are so narrow. Based on a coupled channel
calculation of the pseudoscalar meson-baryon and vector meson-baryon systems
with chiral and hidden local symmetry Lagrangians, we find that the answer lies
in the intricate hadron dynamics. We find that the known mass, width,
spin-parity and branching ratios of $\Xi (1690)$ can be naturally explained in
terms of coupled channel meson-baryon dynamics. We find another narrow
resonance which can be related to $\Xi(2120)$. We also look for exotic states
$\Xi^{+}$ and $\Xi^{--}$ but find none. In addition we provide the cross
sections for $ \bar K \Lambda, \bar K \Sigma \rightarrow \pi \Xi$ which can be
useful for understanding the enhanced yield of $\Xi$ reported in recent studies

meso-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. It is found that by locally
introducing defects in the 2x10^18 - 5x10^21 cm-3 density range, a significant
reduction of, as well as of density, can be induced in the diamond crystal
structure without incurring in the graphitization of the material. Ab initio
atomistic simulations confirm the experimental findings with a good degree of
confidence. FEM simulations are further employed to verify the consistency of
measured deformations with a stiffness reduction, and to derive strain and
stress levels in the implanted region. Combining these experimental and
numerical results, we also provide insight into the mechanism responsible for
the depth dependence of the graphitization threshold in diamond. This work

calculate the current along the stretched DNA using a combination of molecular

however topologically trivial, because a valley-independent gap is
energetically favorable. Here, we show that under the application of interlayer
electric field and circularly polarized light, one valley can be selected to

Tuning this Floquet system stabilizes multiple competing topological ordered

logarithmic radial gradient ($\rm d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r $) in the upper 10~Mm
is close to $-1$ from the equator to $60^\circ$ latitude.We aim to measure the
temporal variation of the rotational shear over solar cycle 23 and the rising
phase of cycle 24 (1996-2015). We used f mode frequency splitting data spanning
1996 to 2011 from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and 2010 to 2015 from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI). In a first for such studies, the f mode
frequency splitting data were obtained from 360-day time series. We used the
same method as in our previous work for measuring $\rm d\ln\Omega/d\ln r $ from
the equator to $80^\circ$ latitude in the outer 13~Mm of the Sun. Then, we
calculated the variation of the gradient at annual cadence relative to the
average over 1996 to 2015. We found the rotational shear at low latitudes
($0^\circ$ to $30^\circ$) to vary in-phase with the solar activity, varying by
$\sim \pm 10$\% over the period 1996 to 2015. At high latitudes ($60^\circ$ to
$80^\circ$), we found rotational shear to vary in anti-phase with the solar
activity. By comparing the radial gradient obtained from the splittings of the
360-day and the corresponding 72-day time series of HMI and MDI data, we
suggest that the splittings obtained from the 72-day HMI time series suffer
from systematic errors. We provide a quantitative measurement of the temporal
variation of the outer part of the near surface shear layer which may provide
useful constraints on dynamo models and differential rotation theory.

collaborative filtering has become an emerging and crucial task. Given the
behavioral history of a specific user, predicting his or her next choice plays
a key role in improving various online services. Meanwhile, there are more and
more scenarios with multiple types of behaviors, while existing works mainly
study sequences with a single type of behavior. As a widely used approach,
Markov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption. As two
classical neural network methods for modeling sequences, recurrent neural
networks cannot well model short-term contexts, and the log-bilinear model is
not suitable for long-term contexts. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent
Log-BiLinear (RLBL) model. It can model multiple types of behaviors in
historical sequences with behavior-specific transition matrices. RLBL applies a
recurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts. It models several items in
each hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for
modeling short-term contexts. Moreover, considering continuous time difference
in behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction, we further extend
RLBL and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific
transition matrices, and accordingly propose a Time-Aware Recurrent
Log-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model. Experimental results show that the proposed RLBL
model and TA-RLBL model yield significant improvements over the competitive
compared methods on three datasets, i.e., Movielens-1M dataset, Global

coherence of the polarization angle. We characterize, for the first time, the
bias on the conventional estimator of the polarization angle dispersion
function (S hereafter) and show that it can be positive or negative depending
on the true value. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to explore
the impact of the noise properties of the polarization data, as well as the
impact of the distribution of the true polarization angles on the bias. We show
that in the case where the ellipticity of the noise in (Q, U) varies by less
than 10 percent, one can use simplified, diagonal approximation of the noise
covariance matrix. In other cases, the shape of the noise covariance matrix
should be taken into account in the estimation of S. We also study new
estimators such as the dichotomic and the polynomial estimators. Though the
dichotomic estimator cannot be directly used to estimate S, we show that, on
the one hand, it can serve as an indicator of the accuracy of the conventional
estimator and, on the other hand, it can be used for deriving the polynomial
estimator. We propose a method for determining the upper limit of the bias on
the conventional estimator of S. The method is applicable to any linear
polarization data set for which the noise covariance matrices are known.

the spectral type of CoRoT targets, which is based on broadband multi-colour
photometry. We assess the accuracy of this spectral classification for the
first time. We find that the classification method performs better for stars
that were observed during the mission-dedicated photometric ground-based
campaigns.The luminosity class is wrong for less than 7% of the targets.
Generally, the effective temperature of stars classified as early type (O, B,
and A) is overestimated. Conversely, the temperature of stars classified as
later type tends to be underestimated. This is mainly due to the adverse effect
of interstellar reddening. We find that the median error on the effective
temperature is less than 5% for dwarf stars classified with a spectral later
than F0, but it is worse for earlier type stars, with up to 20\% error for A
and late-B dwarfs, and up to 70% for early-B and O-type dwarfs. Similar results
are found for giants, with a median error that is lower than 7% for G- and
later type giants, but greater than 25% for earlier types. Overall, we find an
average median absolute temperature difference |Delta Teff| = 533+\-6 K for the
whole sample of stars classified as dwarfs and |Delta Teff| = 280+\-3 K for the
whole sample of giant stars. The corresponding standard deviation is of about
92+\-5 K for dwarfs and 304+\-4 K for giants. Typically for late-type stars,
this means that the classification is accurate to about half a class.

nature, i.e., coming from the interstellar cloud from which our solar system
was formed. However, interstellar O$_2$ gas is notoriously difficult to detect
and has only been observed in one potential precursor of a solar-like system.
Here, the chemical and physical origin of O$_2$ in comets is investigated using
sophisticated astrochemical models. Three origins are considered: i) in dark
clouds, ii) during forming protostellar disks, and iii) during luminosity
outbursts in disks. The dark cloud models show that reproduction of the
observed abundance of O$_2$ and related species in comet 67P/C-G requires a low
H/O ratio facilitated by a high total density ($\geq 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$), and a
moderate cosmic ray ionisation rate ($\leq 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$) while a
temperature of 20 K, slightly higher than the typical temperatures found in
dark clouds, also enhances the production of O$_2$. Disk models show that O$_2$
can only be formed in the gas phase in intermediate disk layers, and cannot
explain the strong correlation between O$_2$ and H$_2$O in comet 67P/C-G
together with the weak correlation between other volatiles and H$_2$O. However,
primordial O$_2$ ice can survive transport into the comet-forming regions of
disks. Taken together, these models favour a dark cloud (or ""primordial"")
origin for O$_2$ in comets, albeit for dark clouds which are warmer and denser
than those usually considered as solar system progenitors.

due to the 3D patterning of the electrodes results in a shorter travel path for
the excess charge carriers, thus contributing to a more efficient charge
collection mech-anism. The CCE of the device was mapped by means of the Ion
Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique. A 1 MeV proton micro-beam was raster
scanned over the active area of the diamond detector under different bias
voltage conditions, enabling to probe the charge transport properties of the
detector up to a depth of 8 {\mu}m below the sample surface. The experimental
results, supported by the numerical simulations, show a significant improvement
in the 3D-detector performance (i.e. CCE, energy resolution, extension of the
active area) if compared with the results obtained by standard surface metallic
electrodes.

depend on time in an arbitrary (e.g. oscillatory) manner, and for arbitrary
initial conditions. We show that in the case of periodic external activation

the RC low-pass filter, where slow oscillations of the external driving have a
greater effect on gene expression than the fast ones. We also demonstrate that
the $n$-th cumulant of the protein number distribution depends on the $n$-th

different measures of noise (coefficient of variation, Fano factor, fractional
change of variance) may vary in time in a different manner. Therefore, any
biological hypothesis of evolutionary optimization based on the nonmonotonicity
of a chosen measure of noise must justify why it assumes that biological
evolution quantifies noise in that particular way. Finally, we show that not
only for exponentially distributed burst sizes but also for a wider class of
burst size distributions (e.g. Dirac delta and gamma) the control of gene
expression level by burst frequency modulation gives rise to proportional
scaling of variance of the protein number distribution to its mean, whereas the

capacity to describe some geometrical variables of the droplet-gas interface,
by analogy with the liquid-gas interface in interfacial flows. For this
purpose, we use fractional size-moments, where the size variable is taken as
the droplet surface. In order to evaluate the evaporation of the polydisperse
spray, we use a smooth reconstruction which maximizes the Shannon entropy.
However, the use of fractional moments introduces some theoretical and
numerical difficulties, which need to be tackled. First, relying on a study of
the moment space, we extend the Maximum Entropy (ME) reconstruction of the size
distribution to the case of fractional moments. Then, we propose a new accurate
and realizable algorithm to solve the moment evolution due to evaporation,
which preserves the structure of the moment space. This algorithm is based on a
mathematical analysis of the kinetic evolution due to evaporation, where it
shown that the evolution of some negative order fractional moments have to be
properly predicted, a peculiarity related to the use of fractional moments. The
present model and numerical schemes yield an accurate and stable evaluationof
the moment dynamics with minimal number of variables, as well as a minimal
computational cost as with the EMSM model, but with the very interesting
additional capacity of coupling with diffuse interface model and transport
equation of averaged geometrical interface variables, which are essential in

studying interacting quantum many-body systems. The vast majority of QMC
calculations in interacting fermion systems require a constraint to control the
sign problem. The constraint involves an input trial wave function which
restricts the random walks. We introduce a systematically improvable constraint
which relies on the fundamental role of the density or one-body density matrix.
An independent-particle calculation is coupled to an auxiliary-field QMC
calculation. The independent-particle solution is used as the constraint in
QMC, which then produces the input density or density matrix for the next
iteration. The constraint is optimized by the self-consistency between the
many-body and independent-particle calculations. The approach is demonstrated
in the two-dimensional Hubbard model by accurately determining the ground state
when collective modes separated by tiny energy scales are present in the
magnetic and charge correlations. Our approach also provides an ab initio way

potential of reaching higher degree of parallelism, and also provides extra
possibilities and challenges. It not only provides synchronization and inherent
parallelization, but also takes over some duties typically offered by the OS,
and even opens the till now closed machine instructions for the end-user. A
toolchain for EMPA architecture with Y86 cores has been prepared, including an
assembler and a cycle-accurate simulator. The assembler is equipped with some
meta-instructions, which allow to use all advanced possibilities of the EMPA

optical properties of materials. By appropriate masking, this technique can be
used to define nano- and micro-structures. However, depending on the type of
mask used, experiments have shown that vacancy-related substrate modification
can be inferred tens of microns away from the edge of the mask used to define
the implanted region. This could be due to fast diffusion of vacancies from the
implanted area during annealing or to a geometric effect related to ion
scattering around the mask edges. For quantum and single-atom devices, stray
ion damage can be deleterious and must be minimized. In order to profile the
distribution of implantation-induced damage, we have used the nitrogen-vacancy
colour centre as a sensitive marker for vacancy concentration and distribution
following MeV He ion implantation into diamond and annealing. Results show that
helium atoms implanted through a mask clamped to the diamond surface are
scattered underneath the mask to distances in the range of tens of micrometers
from the mask edge. Implantation through a lithographically defined and
deposited mask, with no spacing between the mask and the substrate,
significantly reduces the scattering to <5 m but does not eliminate it. These
scattering distances are much larger than the theoretically estimated vacancy
diffusion distance of 260 nm under similar conditions. This paper shows that
diffusion, upon annealing, of vacancies created by ion implantation in diamond
is limited and the appearance of vacancies many tens of micrometers from the
edge of the mask is due to scattering effects.

strengths of the order of 0.1-10 kG. This leads to the creation of persistent
surface structures (spots) in stars with sufficiently weak winds as a result of
the radiative diffusion. These spots become evident in spectroscopic and
photometric variability. This type of variability is not expected in stars with
strong winds, where the wind inhibits the radiative diffusion. Therefore, a
weak photometric variability of the magnetic Of?p star HD 191612 is attributed
to the light absorption in the circumstellar clouds. We study the nature of the
photometric variability of HD 191612. We assume that the variability results
from variable wind blanketing induced by surface variations of the magnetic
field tilt and modulated by stellar rotation. We used our global kinetic
equilibrium (NLTE) wind models with radiative force determined from the
radiative transfer equation in the comoving frame (CMF) to predict the stellar
emergent flux. Our models describe the stellar atmosphere in a unified manner
and account for the influence of the wind on the atmosphere. The models are
calculated for different wind mass-loss rates to mimic the effect of magnetic
field tilt on the emergent fluxes. We integrate the emergent fluxes over the
visible stellar surface for individual rotational phases, and calculate the
rotationally modulated light curve of HD 191612. The wind blanketing that
varies across surface is able to explain a part of the observed light
variability in this star. The mechanism is able to operate even at relatively
low mass-loss rates. The remaining variability is most likely caused by the
flux absorption in circumstellar clouds. The variable wind blanketing is an
additional source of the light variability in massive stars. The presence of
the rotational light variability may serve as a proxy for the magnetic field.

cheap and abundant whereas labeled data is expensive. Active learning
algorithms developed to achieve better performance with lower cost. Usually
Representativeness and Informativeness are used in active learning algoirthms.
Advanced recent active learning methods consider both of these criteria.
Despite its vast literature, very few active learning methods consider noisy
instances, i.e. label noisy and outlier instances. Also, these methods didn't
consider accuracy in computing representativeness and informativeness. Based on
the idea that inaccuracy in these measures and not taking noisy instances into
consideration are two sides of a coin and are inherently related, a new loss
function is proposed. This new loss function helps to decrease the effect of
noisy instances while at the same time, reduces bias. We defined ""instance
complexity"" as a new notion of complexity for instances of a learning problem.
It is proved that noisy instances in the data if any, are the ones with maximum
instance complexity. Based on this loss function which has two functions for
classifying ordinary and noisy instances, a new classifier, named
""Simple-Complex Classifier"" is proposed. In this classifier there are a simple
and a complex function, with the complex function responsible for selecting
noisy instances. The resulting optimization problem for both learning and
active learning is highly non-convex and very challenging. In order to solve
it, a convex relaxation is proposed.

treatment participation depends on individual choices, and treatment assignment
may depend on unobservable quantities associated with future outcomes. We rely

conditionally independent on future potential outcomes given past treatments,
covariates and principal stratum membership, a latent variable defined by the
joint value of observed and missing intermediate outcomes. We evaluate SI and
LSI, using theoretical arguments and simulation studies to investigate the

improved orbital ephemeris of LS IV -08$^{\rm o}$ 3 and map its accretion disk
in the light of the H$\alpha$ emission using Doppler tomography. We find that
the emission has a two component origin, arising in the outer parts of the
accretion disk and possibly on the illuminated face of the secondary star. The
light curve of LS IV -08$^{\rm o}$ 3 exhibits a low level of flickering and
indications for a modulation on the orbital period. Spectroscopy of HQ Mon
suggests an orbital period of $\approx$5.15 hours which is incompatible with
previous (uncertain) estimates. The light curves show the typical low scale
flickering of UX UMa type nova-like systems, superposed upon variations on
longer time scales. During one night a modulation with a period of $\approx$41
min is observed, visible for at least 4 hours. However, it does not repeat
itself in other nights. A spectroscopic orbital period of $\approx$5.5 hours is
derived for ST Cha. A previously suspected period of 6.8 hours (or
alternatively 9.6 hours), based on historical photographic photometry is
incompatible with the spectroscopic period. Moreover, we show that our new as
well as previous photometry does not contain evidence for the quoted
photometric period.

We find that the QMI in the localized phase decays exponentially with the
distance between the regions traced out, allowing us to define a correlation
length, which converges to the localization length in the case of one particle.
Second, we show how the QMI can be used as a dynamical indicator to distinguish
an Anderson insulator phase from an MBL phase. By studying the spread of the
QMI after a global quench from a random product state, we show that the QMI
does not spread in the Anderson insulator phase but grows logarithmically in

unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first
time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard
machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are
exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as
exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological
studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical
machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus
of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains
recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are
morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or
gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the {\em status quo} for the
distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These
regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics.
In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute
new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test
(WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results
have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields
of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility
that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate

given to a simple but flexible three-parameter model of two particles in two

repulsion and no inter-well tunneling, can both be treated as emergent
symmetries of the few-particle Hamiltonian. These symmetries are the
mathematical consequences of infinite barriers in configuration space. They are
necessary to explain the pattern of degeneracies in the energy spectrum, to
understand how degeneracies are broken for models away from limiting cases, and
to explain separability and integrability. These symmetry methods are
extendable to more complicated models and the results have practical

disorder and whether Anderson localization occurs.In this work, the effects of
nonperturbative topological (vortex loop) excitations and Berry phase in
disordered time-reversal invariant 3d Weyl semimetal are studied.It is shown
that the chiral symmetry is restored in the nonlinear sigma model describing
the diffusons upon disorder average as any net topological term and its
delocalization result do not take effect at sufficiently short length
scales.Anderson localization occurs at sufficiently strong disorder and we
predict that chirality and related phenomena disappear at such

phase that impedes such localization effect.We show the occurrence of
destructive interference between the vortex loops and between scattering paths

platforms for the development of a new generation of biosensors is diamond, due
to its biocompatibility, transparency and chemical inertness. Moreover, the
electrical properties of diamond can be turned from a perfect insulator into a
conductive material (resistivity Ohm cm) by exploiting the metastable nature of
this allotropic form of carbon. A 16 channels MEA (Multi Electrode Array)
suitable for cell culture growing has been fabricated by means of ion
implantation. A focused 1.2 MeV He+ beam was scanned on a IIa single-crystal
diamond sample (4.5x4.5x0.5 mm3) to cause highly damaged sub-superficial
structures that were defined with micrometric spatial resolution. After
implantation, the sample was annealed. This process provides the conversion of
the sub-superficial highly damaged regions to a graphitic phase embedded in a
highly insulating diamond matrix. Thanks to a three-dimensional masking
technique, the endpoints of the sub-superficial channels emerge in contact with
the sample surface, therefore being available as sensing electrodes. Cyclic
voltammetry and amperometry measurements of solutions with increasing
concentrations of adrenaline were performed to characterize the biosensor
sensitivity. The reported results demonstrate that this new type of biosensor
is suitable for in vitro detection of catecholamine release.

terahertz (THz) acoustic waves, which is a regime not previously tested. For a
thin film on a piezoelectric substrate, this can be achieved by coupling the
substrate to a tunable coherent THz electromagnetic source. Suggested materials
for initial tests are a niobium film on a quartz substrate, with a BSCCO
intrinsic Josephson junction (IJJ) stack. This will create acoustic standing
waves on the nm scale in the thin film. A properly tuned standing wave will
enable electron diffraction across the Fermi surface, leading to electron
localization perpendicular to the substrate. This is expected to reduce the
effective dimensionality, and enhance the tendency for superconducting order
parallel to the substrate, even well above the superconducting critical
temperature. This enhancement can be observed by measuring the in-plane
critical current and the perpendicular tunneling gap. A similar experiment may
be carried out for a cuprate thin film, although the conduction electrons might
be more responsive to spin waves than to acoustic waves. These experiments
address a novel regime of large momentum transfer to the electrons, which
should be quite distinct from the more traditional regime of large energy
transfer obtained from direct electromagnetic stimulation. The experiments are
also motivated in part by novel theories of the superconducting state involving

  Two-photon process for Fabricating Subwavelength Structures",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localized polymerization in subwavelength volumes using two photon dyes has
now become a well-established method for fabrication of subwavelength
structures. Unfortunately, the two photon absorption dyes used in such process
are not only expensive but also proprietary. LTPO-L is an inexpensive, easily
available single photon photoinitiator and has been used extensively for single
photon absorption of UV light for polymerization. These polymerization volumes
however are not localized and extend to micron size resolution having limited
applications. We have exploited high quantum yield of radicals of LTPO-Lfor
absorption of two photons to achieve localized polymerization in subwavelength
volumes, much below the diffraction limit. Critical concentration (10wt%) of
LTPO-Lin acrylate (Sartomer) was found optimal to achieve subwavelength
localized polymerization and has been demonstrated by fabricating 2D/3D complex
nanostructures and functional devices such as variable polymeric gratings with
nanoscaled subwavelength resolution. Systematic studies on influence of LTPO-L
concentration on two photon polymerization of commercially available
photopolymer (Sartomer) show that resolution of the fabricated structures
critically depend on loading of LPTO-L. This is expected to unleash the true
potential of two photon polymerization for fabrication of complex polymeric
nanodevices at a larger scale.

  issues for steady values of Specific Power Absorption through time","11 pages, 6 figures","European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, 2015, 4524; 4531","10.1002/ejic.201500303",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virtually all clinical applications of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) require
the formulation of biocompatible, water-based magnetic colloids. For magnetic
hyperthermia, the requirements also include a high colloidal stability against
precipitation and agglomeration of the constituent MNPs, in order to keep the
heating efficiency of the ferrofluid in the long term. The specific power
absorption (SPA) of single-domain MNPs depends critically on the average
particle size and size distribution width, therefore first-rate reproducibility
among different batches regarding these parameters are also needed. We have
studied the evolution of the SPA of highly reproducible and stable water-based
colloid composed of polymer coated $Fe_{3}O_{4}$ magnetic nanoparticles. By
measuring the specific power absorption (SPA) values along one year as a
function of field amplitude and frequencies ($H \leq 24 kA/m$; $260 \leq f \leq
830 kHz$), we demonstrated that SPA in these samples can be made reproducible
between successive synthesis, and stable along several months, due to the in
situ polymer coating that provides colloidal stability and keeps dipolar
interactions negligible.

network scientist seeks to understand. These communities may overlap or have
intricate internal structure. Extracting communities with particular
topological structure, even when they overlap with other communities, is a
powerful capability that would provide novel avenues of focusing in on
structure of interest. In this work we consider extracting highly-cyclic
regions of directed graphs (digraphs). We demonstrate that embeddings derived
from complex-valued eigenvectors associated with stochastic propagator
eigenvalues near roots of unity are well-suited for this purpose. We prove
several fundamental theoretic results demonstrating the connection between
these eigenpairs and the presence of highly-cyclic structure and we demonstrate
the use of these vectors on a few real-world examples.

$\mathbb{C}$-algebra endomorphism that has an invertible Jacobian. We bring two
ideas concerning the Jacobian Conjecture: First, we conjecture that for all
$n$, the degree of the field extension $\mathbb{C}(F(x_1),\ldots,F(x_n))
\subseteq \mathbb{C}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is less than or equal to $d^{n-1}$, where
$d$ is the minimum of the degrees of the $F(x_i)$'s. If this conjecture is
true, then the generalized Jacobian Conjecture is true. Second, we suggest to
replace in some known theorems the assumption on the degrees of the $F(x_i)$'s
by a similar assumption on the degrees of the minimal polynomials of the
$x_i$'s over $\mathbb{C}(F(x_1)\ldots,f(x_n))$; this way we obtain some
analogous results to the known ones.
