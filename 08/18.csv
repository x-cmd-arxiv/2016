physics declined by 25%, in chemistry declined by 33%, and overall in physical
sciences and engineering fell 40%. Data suggest that these declines are
correlated to a deemphasis in most states of practicing computation skills in
mathematics. Analysis of state standards put into place between 1990 and 2010
find that most states directed teachers to deemphasize both memorization and
student practice in computational problem solving. Available state test score
data show a significant decline in student computation skills. In recent
international testing, scores for US 16 to 24 year olds in numeracy finished
last among 22 tested nations in the OECD. Recent studies in cognitive science
have found that to solve well-structured problems in the sciences, students
must first memorize fundamental facts and procedures in mathematics and science
until they can be recalled with automaticity, then practice applying those
skills in a variety of distinctive contexts. Actions are suggested to improve
US STEM graduation rates by aligning US math and science curricula with the
recommendations of cognitive science.

related to the relaxor state transition of the materials. This work presents a
systematic study on the ECE and the state transition of the BZT, using a
combined canonical and microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations based a
lattice-based on a Ginzburg-Landau-type Hamiltonian. For comparison and
verification, experimental measurements have been carried on BTO and BZT
($x=0.12$ and $0.2$) samples, including the ECE at various temperatures, domain
patterns by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy at room temperature, and the P-E
loops at various temperatures. Results show that the dependency of BZT behavior
of the Zr-concentration can be classified into three different stages. In the
composition range of $ 0 \leq x \leq 0.2 $, ferroelectric domains are visible,
but ECE peak drops with increasing Zr-concentration harshly. In the range of $
0.3 \leq x \leq 0.7 $, relaxor features become prominent, and the decrease of
ECE with Zr-concentration is moderate. In the high concentration range of $ x
\geq 0.8 $, the material is almost nonpolar, and there is no ECE peak visible.
Results suggest that BZT with certain low range of Zr-concentration around
$x=0.12 \sim 0.3 $ can be a good candidate with relatively high ECE and
simutaneously wide temperature application range at rather low temperature.

suppress the number of sites contributing to the condensed valence-bond state.

density functional theory calculations indicate that removal of electrons from

they might extract angular momentum from the disk and thus allow mass accretion

likewise, their contribution to mass and angular momentum extraction during
protostar formation remains an open question.
  Our aim is to investigate the ejection process in the low-mass Class 0
protostar L1157. This source is associated with a spectacular bipolar outflow,
and the recent detection of high-velocity SiO suggests the occurrence of a jet.
  Observations of CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 at 0.8"" resolution were obtained with the
IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer as part of the CALYPSO large program. The
jet and outflow structure were fit with a precession model. We derived the
column density of CO and SiO, as well as the jet mass-loss rate and mechanical
luminosity.
  High-velocity CO and SiO emission resolve for the first time the first 200 au
of the outflow-driving molecular jet. The jet is strongly asymmetric, with the
blue lobe 0.65 times slower than the red lobe. This suggests that the
large-scale asymmetry of the outflow is directly linked to the jet velocity and
that the asymmetry in the launching mechanism has been at work for the past
1800 yr. Velocity asymmetries are common in T Tauri stars, which suggests that
the jet formation mechanism from Class 0 to Class II stages might be similar.
Our model simultaneously fits the inner jet and the clumpy 0.2 pc scale outflow
by assuming that the jet precesses counter-clockwise on a cone inclined by 73
degree to the line of sight with an opening angle of 8 degree on a period of
1640 yr. The estimated jet mass flux and mechanical luminosity are 7.7e-7

we explore very dilute solutions by the means of numerical simulations, and
show that, in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions and for sufficiently
strong interactions, percolating colloidal gels can be realised at very low
values of the volume fraction. Characterising the structure of the network of
the arrested material we find that, when reducing the volume fraction, the gels
are dominated by low-energy local structures, analogous to the isolated
clusters of the interaction potential. Changing the strength of the interaction
allows us to tune the compactness of the gel as characterised by the fractal
dimension, with low interaction strength favouring more chain-like structures.

stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles. It causes the appearance
of a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles in the direction of the
turbulent heat flux. This non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles is
proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the
effective velocity of inertial particles. The theory of this effect has been
previously developed only for small temperature gradients and small Stokes
numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 224, 1996). In this study a generalized
theory of turbulent thermal diffusion for arbitrary temperature gradients and
Stokes numbers has been developed. The laboratory experiments in the
oscillating grid turbulence and in the multi-fan produced turbulence have been
performed to validate the theory of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly
stratified turbulent flows. It has been shown that the ratio of the effective
velocity of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent
velocity for large Reynolds numbers is less than 1. The effective velocity of
inertial particles as well as the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal
diffusion increase with Stokes numbers reaching the maximum at small Stokes
numbers and decreases for larger Stokes numbers. The effective coefficient of
turbulent thermal diffusion also decreases with the mean temperature gradient.
It has been demonstrated that the developed theory is in a good agreement with
the results of the laboratory experiments.

the delivery of electricity from substation to end-users/loads. A distribution
grid is operated in a radial/tree-like structure, determined by switching on or
off lines from an underling loopy graph. Due to the presence of limited
real-time measurements, the critical problem of fast estimation of the radial
grid structure is not straightforward. This paper presents a new learning
algorithm that uses measurements only at the terminal or leaf nodes in the
distribution grid to estimate its radial structure. The algorithm is based on
results involving voltages of node triplets that arise due to the radial
structure. The polynomial computational complexity of the algorithm is
presented along with a detailed analysis of its working. The most significant
contribution of the approach is that it is able to learn the structure in
certain cases where available measurements are confined to only half of the
nodes. This represents learning under minimum permissible observability.
Performance of the proposed approach in learning structure is demonstrated by
experiments on test radial distribution grids.

In a well-understood
case of Galton-Watson trees, a distribution on a space of trees is said to be
self-similar if it is invariant with respect to the operation of pruning, which
cuts the tree leaves. This only happens for the critical Galton-Watson tree (a
constant process progeny), which also exhibits other special symmetries. We
extend the prune-invariance setup to arbitrary binary trees with edge lengths.
In this general case the class of self-similar processes becomes much richer
and covers a variety of practically important situations. The main result is
construction of the hierarchical branching processes that satisfy various
self-similarity definitions (including mean self-similarity and self-similarity
in edge-lengths) depending on the process parameters. Taking the limit of
averaged stochastic dynamics, as the number of trajectories increases, we
obtain a deterministic system of differential equations that describes the
process evolution. This system is used to establish a phase transition that
separates fading and explosive behavior of the average process progeny. We
describe a class of critical Tokunaga processes that happen at the phase
transition boundary. They enjoy multiple additional symmetries and include the
celebrated critical binary Galton-Watson tree with independent exponential edge
length as a special case. Finally, we discuss a duality between trees and
continuous functions, and introduce a class of extreme-invariant processes,
constructed as the Harris paths of a self-similar hierarchical branching
process, whose local minima has the same (linearly scaled) distribution as the
original process.

particular set of states $P$, together with the ad hoc postulate known as
Preparation Independence Postulate (PIP), the theorem establishes that these
two properties imply the $\psi$-onticity (realism) of the set of all pure

one hand, it has been possible to derive similar results without the use of the

$\neg$PP compatibility of the set of states $P$, when $P$ is under the

based on distance and latent class models; these models may exhibit the
phenomenon of masking of groups of small sizes; probably due to the spherical
nature of rank data. Our approach diverges from the traditional methods; it is
directional and uses a logical principle, the law of contradiction. We discuss
the concept of a mixture for rank data essentially in terms of the notion of
global homogeneity of its group components. Local heterogeneities may appear
once the group components of the mixture have been discovered. This is done via
the exploratory analysis of rank data by taxicab correspondence analysis with
the nega coding: If the first factor is an affine function of the Borda count,
then we say that the rank data are globally homogenous, and local
heterogeneities may appear on the consequent factors; otherwise, the rank data
either are globally homogenous with outliers, or a mixture of globally
homogenous groups. Also we introduce a new coefficient of global homogeneity,
GHC. GHC is based on the first taxicab dispersion measure: it takes values
between 0 and 100\%, so it is easily interpretable. GHC measures the extent of
crossing of scores of voters between two or three blocks seriation of the items
where the Borda count statistic provides consensus ordering of the items on the
first axis. Examples are provided. Key words: Preferences; rankings; Borda

extragalactic jets provides a unique probe of physical mechanisms governing the
launching, acceleration, and collimation of relativistic outflows. The
two-dimensional structure and kinematics of the jet in M\,87 (NGC\,4486) have
been studied by applying the Wavelet-based Image Segmentation and Evaluation
(WISE) method to 11 images obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) observations made in January-August 2007 at 43 GHz ($\lambda = 7$ mm).
The WISE analysis recovers a detailed two-dimensional velocity field in the jet
in M\,87 at sub-parsec scales. The observed evolution of the flow velocity with
distance from the jet base can be explained in the framework of MHD jet
acceleration and Poynting flux conversion. A linear acceleration regime is
observed up to $z_{obs} \sim 2$\,mas. The acceleration is reduced at larger
scales, which is consistent with saturation of Poynting flux conversion.
Stacked cross correlation analysis of the images reveals a pronounced
stratification of the flow. The flow consists of a slow, mildly relativistic
layer (moving at $\beta \sim 0.5\,c$), associated either with instability
pattern speed or an outer wind, and a fast, accelerating stream line (with
$\beta \sim 0.92$, corresponding to a bulk Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 2.5$). A
systematic difference of the apparent speeds in the northern and southern limbs
of the jet is detected, providing evidence for jet rotation. The angular
velocity of the magnetic field line associated with this rotation suggests that
the jet in M87 is launched in the inner part of the disk, at a distance $r_0
\sim 5\, R_\mathrm{s}$ from the central engine. The combined results of the
analysis imply that MHD acceleration and conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic
energy play the dominant roles in collimation and acceleration of the flow in
M\,87.

flow of physical commodities through edges between its constituent nodes. These
include power grid, natural gas transmission network, water pipelines etc. In
such networks, the flow on each edge is characterized by a function of the
nodal potentials on either side of the edge. Further the net flow in and out of
each node is conserved. Learning the structure and state of physical networks
is necessary for optimal control as well as to quantify its privacy needs. We
consider radial flow networks and study the problem of learning the operational
network from a loopy graph of candidate edges using statistics of nodal
potentials. Based on the monotonic properties of the flow functions, the key
result in this paper shows that if variance of the difference of nodal
potentials is used to weight candidate edges, the operational edges form the
minimum spanning tree in the loopy graph. Under realistic conditions on the
statistics of nodal injection (consumption or production), we provide a greedy
structure learning algorithm with quasilinear computational complexity in the
number of candidate edges in the network. Our learning framework is very
general due to two significant attributes. First it is independent of the
specific marginal distributions of nodal potentials and only uses order
properties in their second moments. Second, the learning algorithm is agnostic
to exact flow functions that relate edge flows to corresponding potential
differences and is applicable for a broad class of networks with monotonic flow
functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our work through realistic
simulations on diverse physical flow networks and discuss possible extensions

many explosive phenomena observed both in space and in the laboratory, though
the question of how fast magnetic reconnection is triggered in such high
Lundquist ($S$) number plasmas has remained elusive. It has been well
established that reconnection can develop over timescales faster than those
predicted traditionally once kinetic scales are reached. It has also been shown
that, within the framework of resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), fast
reconnection is achieved for thin enough sheets via the onset of the so-called
plasmoid instability. The latter was discovered in studies specifically devoted
to the Sweet-Parker current sheet, either as an initial condition or an
apparent transient state developing in nonlinear studies. On the other hand, a
fast tearing instability can grow on an ideal, i.e., $S$-independent, timescale
(dubbed ""ideal"" tearing) within current sheets whose aspect ratio scales with
the macroscopic Lundquist number as $L/a\sim S^{1/3}$ -- much smaller than the
Sweet-Parker one -- suggesting a new way to approach to the initiation of fast
reconnection in collapsing current configurations. Here we present an overview
of what we have called ""ideal"" tearing in resistive MHD, and discuss how the
same reasoning can be extended to other plasma models commonly used that
include electron inertia and kinetic effects. We then discuss a scenario for
the onset of ""ideal"" fast reconnection via collapsing current sheets and
describe a quantitative model for the interpretation of the nonlinear evolution
of ""ideally"" unstable sheets in two dimensions.

scarcity of the licensed spectrum on the other hand, mobile operators are
considering the use of unlicensed bands (especially those in 5 GHz) as
complementary spectrum for providing higher system capacity and better user
experience. This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the
name of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a
holistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly
optimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands. We pose this traffic
balancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence
of WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission
probability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands. The
motivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between
or aggregate licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the
interference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We
derive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally
propose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on
both bands. Through numerical and simulation results, we show that our proposed
traffic balancing scheme, besides enabling better LTE-WiFi coexistence and
efficient utilization of the radio resources relative to the existing traffic
balancing scheme, also provides a better tradeoff between maximizing the total
network throughput and achieving fairness among all network flows compared to
alternative approaches.

Because a significant fraction of the available information is contained in
correlations with the anomalous temperature data, it is essential to account
for these constraints. We also present a systematic approach to finding a set
of normal modes that maximize the available information, generalizing the
well-known Karhunen-Loeve transformation to take account of the constraints
from the temperature data. A polarization map covering at least $\sim 60\%$ of
the sky should be able to provide a $3\sigma$ detection of modulation at the

encapsulates the signal due to temperature-polarization correlation.

With reasonable physical assumptions, we show that a NESS close to local

efficient tensor network. We further argue that the NESS may be found by
dynamically evolving the system within a manifold of appropriate low
entanglement states. A physically realistic law of dynamical evolution is
Markovian open system dynamics, or the Lindblad equation. We explore this
approach in a well-studied free fermion model where comparisons with the

the relation between the CO (3-2) luminosity (L'CO(3-2)) and the far Infrared
luminosity (LFIR) in a sample of 29 early stage and 31 late stage merging
galaxies, and 28 nearby isolated spiral galaxies. We find that normal isolated
spiral galaxies and merging galaxies have different slopes (alpha) in the log
L'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane (alpha ~ 0.79 for spirals and ~ 1.12 for mergers).
The large slope (alpha > 1) for merging galaxies can be interpreted as an
evidence for increasing Star Formation Efficiency (SFE=LFIR/L'CO(3-2)) as a
function of LFIR. Comparing our results with sub-kpc scale local star formation
and global star-burst activity in the high-z Universe, we find deviations from
the linear relationship in the log L'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane for the late
stage mergers and high-z star forming galaxies. Finally, we find that the
average SFE gradually increases from isolated galaxies, merging galaxies, and
to high-z submillimeter galaxies / quasi-stellar objects (SMGs/QSOs). By
comparing our findings with the results from numerical simulations, we suggest;
(1) inefficient star-bursts triggered by disk-wide dense clumps occur in the
early stage of interaction and (2) efficient star-bursts triggered by central
concentration of gas occur in the final stage. A systematic high spatial

their average spectral properties. We found that AGN populations across our
sample had less time since the last starburst than the overall galaxy
populations. We did not find any relation between AGN activity and location
within the LSSs, suggesting triggering mechanisms which depend on global
environment are at most sub-dominant. To focus on differences between our AGNs,
we grouped them into four sub-samples based on the spectral properties of their
parents LSSs. We found one of the sub-samples, SG0023 & SC1604, stood out from
the others: AGNs in this sample were disproportionately luminous, their average
time since the last starburst event was the smallest, despite the fact that
this was not true of the overall galaxy population in those LSSs, and both the
AGNs and the overall galaxy population had the largest fraction of close
kinematic pairs, which indicates a higher rate of galaxy mergers and
interactions. These results suggest that major mergers are driving AGN activity
in SG0023 & SC1604, while other processes are likely triggering less luminous
AGNs in the rest of our sample. Additionally, minor mergers are unlikely to
play a significant role, since the same conditions that lead to more major
mergers should should also lead to more minor mergers, which is not observed in
SG0023 & SC1604.

spectra for scalar and tensor modes which are almost scale-invariant but with a
red tilt for scalar modes but a blue tilt for tensor modes. This feature,
however, can also be realized in the so-called G-inflation model, in which
Horndeski operators are introduced which leads to a blue tensor tilt by softly
breaking the Null Energy Condition. In this article we search for potential
observational differences between these two cosmologies by performing detailed
perturbation analyses based on the Effective Field Theory approach. Our results
show that, although both two models produce blue tilted tensor perturbations,
they behave differently in three aspects. Firstly, String Gas Cosmology
predicts a specific consistency relation between the index of the scalar modes
ns and that of tensor ones nt, which is hard to be reproduced by G-inflation.
Secondly, String Gas Cosmology typically predicts non-Gaussianities which are
highly suppressed on observable scales, while G-inflation gives rise to
observationally large non-Gaussianities because the kinetic terms in the action
become important during inflation. However, after finely tuning the model
parameters of G-inflation it is possible to obtain a blue tensor spectrum and
negligible non-Gaussianities with a degeneracy between the two models. This
degeneracy can be broken by a third observable, namely the scale dependence of
the nonlinearity parameter, which vanishes for G-inflation but has a blue tilt
in the case of String Gas Cosmology. Therefore, we conclude that String Gas
Cosmology is in principle observationally distinguishable from the single field
inflationary cosmology, even allowing for modifications such as G-inflation.

we map the rest-frame UV emission on the same scale as the dust, effectively
resolving the 'infrared excess' (IRX=L_FIR/L_UV) in a normal galaxy at z=3.
Integrated over the galaxy we measure IRX=0.56+/-0.15, and the galaxy-averaged
UV slope is beta=-1.25+/-0.03. This puts the galaxy a factor of ~10 below the
IRX-beta relation for local starburst nuclei of Meurer et al. (1999). However,
IRX varies by more than a factor of 3 across the galaxy, and we conclude that
the complex relative morphology of the dust relative to UV emission is largely
responsible for the scatter in the IRX-beta relation at high-z. A naive
application of a Meurer-like dust correction based on the UV slope would
dramatically over-estimate the total star formation rate, and our results
support growing evidence that when integrated over the galaxy, the typical
conditions in high-z star-forming galaxies are not analogous to those in the
local starburst nuclei used to establish the Meurer relation.

control for correlations between quiescent fraction and redshift and stellar

excess of star-forming neighbors around star-forming central galaxies, of
$\sim5$% on scales of 0-1 Mpc and a $2.5\sigma$ two-halo signal of $\sim1$% on

consistent with galactic conformity being the result of large-scale tidal
fields and reflecting assembly bias. We also measure the star-forming fraction

overdense environments, independent of stellar mass. However, we find that
environment does not affect the star formation efficiency of central galaxies,

irregular morphology with detections of tidal features up to 1.3 deg (3 kpc)
from its center. This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky
Way's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation
rather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference
in combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a
very eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On
such an orbit, Hercules ""explodes"" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at
pericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its
orbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially
outwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical
nature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to
its orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a
distance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is
significantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving
perpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in
the radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that
formed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic
substructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on
such a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic
potential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of
Hercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints
on the potential of the Milky Way.

to test how well different models accommodate the data. The observational data
clearly prefer a model in which star formation in low-mass halos changes
behavior at a characteristic redshift $z_c\sim 2$. There is also tentative
evidence that this characteristic redshift depends on environment, becoming
$z_c\sim 4$ in regions that eventually evolve into rich clusters of galaxies.
The constrained model is used to understand how galaxies form and evolve in
dark matter halos, and to make predictions for other statistical properties of
the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass functions of galaxies at high
$z$, the star formation and stellar mass assembly histories in dark matter
halos. A comparison of our model predictions with those of other empirical
models shows that different models can make vastly different predictions, even
though all of them are tuned to match the observed stellar mass functions of
galaxies.

superconducting ground-state with strong non-BCS features due to its proximity
to a Mott insulator. We find that, while strong correlations make
superconductivity in this system immune to weak disorder, superconductivity is
destroyed efficiently when disorder strength is comparable to the effective
bandwidth. The suppression of charge motion in regions of strong potential
fluctuation leads to formation of Mott insulating patches, which anchor a
larger non-superconducting region around them. The system thus breaks into
islands of Mott insulating and superconducting regions, with Anderson
insulating regions occurring along the boundary of these regions. Thus,
electronic correlation and disorder, when both are strong, aid each other in
destroying superconductivity, in contrast to their competition at weak
disorder. Our results shed light on why Zinc impurities are efficient in
destroying superconductivity in cuprates, even though it is robust to weaker

exfoliated WSe$_2$ monolayers affixed to single-mode optical fibers, we tune
the surrounding dielectric environment by encapsulating the flakes with
different materials, and perform polarized low-temperature magneto-absorption
studies to 65~T. The systematic increase of the exciton's size with dielectric
screening, and concurrent reduction in binding energy (also inferred from these

the sparse suffix tree (and therefore SSA and SLCP) can be built in
asymptotically optimal $O(b)$ space with a Monte Carlo algorithm running in
$O(n)$ time. The main reason for using the SSA and SLCP arrays in place of the
sparse suffix tree is, however, their reduced space of $b$ words each. This

sub-quadratic in-place algorithms for building the SSA and SLCP for

subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups, providing an explicit set of
representatives for the conjugacy classes of such subgroups. Many consequences
of this classification are also given. These include results concerning the
representations of such subgroups on various $G$-modules: for example, the
conjugacy classes of irreducible connected subgroups are determined by their
composition factors on the adjoint module of $G$, with one exception.
  A result of Liebeck and Testerman shows that each irreducible connected
subgroup $X$ of $G$ has only finitely many overgroups and hence the overgroups
of $X$ form a lattice. We provide tables that give representatives of each
conjugacy class of overgroups within this lattice structure. We use this to
prove results concerning the subgroup structure of $G$: for example, when the

scores of classification. Towards this aim, we extract these rules from data
and transform them into constraints for Integer Programming to optimize the
structured problem of assigning labels to super-pixels (consequently pixels) of
an image. In addition, we propose to use soft-constraints in some scenarios,
allowing violating the constraint by imposing a penalty, to make the model more
flexible. We assessed our approach on three datasets and obtained promising
results.

matter has been associated to first order phase transitions in some
phenomenological models, but conclusions on the possible physical existence of
an instability in the strangeness sector are strongly model dependent. Purpose
: The purpose of the present study is to assess whether strangeness
instabilities are related to specific values of the largely unconstrained
hyperon interactions, and to study the effect of the strange meson couplings on
phenomenological properties of neutron stars and supernova matter, once these
latter are fixed to fulfill the constraints imposed by hypernuclear data.
Method : We consider a phenomenological RMF model sufficiently simple to allow
a complete exploration of the parameter space. Results : We show that no
instability at supersaturation density exists for the RMF model, as long as the
parameter space is constrained by basic physical requirements. This is at
variance with a non-relativistic functional, with a functional behavior fitted
through ab-initio calculations. Once the study is extended to include the full
octet, we show that the parameter space allows reasonable radii for canonical
neutron stars as well as massive stars above two-solar mass, together with an
important strangeness content of the order of 30\%, slightly decreasing with
increasing entropy, even in the absence of a strangeness driven phase
transition. Conclusions : We conclude that the hyperon content of neutron stars
and supernova matter cannot be established with present constraints, and is
essentially governed by the unconstrained coupling to the strange isoscalar
meson.

of 266,433 background quasars were searched for the presence of absorption

was used to trace the emission lines. The absorption system catalogue contains

two lines of the doublet. The catalogue was constrained to an absorption line
redshift of 0.35 $\le$ z$_{2796}$ $\le$ 2.3. The rest-frame equivalent width of
the $\lambda$2796 line ranges between 0.2 $\le$ W$_r$ $\le$ 6.2 $\AA$. Using
Gaussian-noise only simulations we estimate a false positive rate of 7.7 per

N^{2796}/\partial z$ of Mg II absorbers and find evidence for steeper evolution
of the systems with W$_r \ge$ 1.2 $\AA$ at low redshifts (z$_{2796}$ $\le$
1.0), consistent with other earlier studies. A suite of null tests over the
redshift range 0.5 $\le$ z$_{2796}$ $\le$ 1.5 was used to study the presence of
systematics and selection effects like the dependence of the number density
evolution of the absorption systems on the properties of the background quasar

a manifold of transitions, of which only the lowest are populated and
contribute to photoluminescence. This leads to a Stokes shift in emission
relative to absorption. Here we show experimentally that the Stokes shift in Pb
and Cd-based chalcogenide CQDs is correlated with the degree of surface
passivation, and develop a model that explains how coupling to the surface
affects the core electronic states. Dark and bright transitions can reorder and
split, increasing the Stokes shift even without the formation of deep traps.
Our findings resolve the highly-debated topic of excess Stokes shifts in PbS
nanocrystals as due to parity-forbidden transitions instead of traps. We
predict that the Stokes shift in PbS can be eliminated via core stoichiometry
control, a critical step towards enhancing the open circuit voltage in quantum
dot solar cells.

equally applied to the digitization of other detector signals. FIPSER is based
on the flash analog to digital converter (FADC) concept, but has the potential
to lower costs and power consumption by using an order of magnitude fewer

utilizing 12 discrete voltage levels with a sampling rate of 4 samples per full

better than the Poisson limit for photon-counting experiments. The time
resolution achieved in this configuration ranges between 0.02 - 0.16 FWHM and

develop effective methods that allow the characterization of random number
generators. However, commonly employed methods either lack formality (e.g. the
NIST test suite), or are inapplicable in principle (e.g. the characterization
derived from the Algorithmic Theory of Information (ATI)). In this letter we
present a novel method based on Bayesian model selection, which is both
rigorous and effective, for characterizing randomness in a bit sequence. We
derive analytic expressions for a model's likelihood which is then used to
compute its posterior probability distribution. Our method proves to be more
rigorous than NIST's suite and the Borel-Normality criterion and its
implementation is straightforward. We have applied our method to an
experimental device based on the process of spontaneous parametric
downconversion, implemented in our laboratory, to confirm that it behaves as a
genuine quantum random number generator (QRNG). As our approach relies on
Bayesian inference, which entails model generalizability, our scheme transcends
individual sequence analysis, leading to a characterization of the source of
the random sequences itself.

  Disks","Ap.J. in press",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many protostellar disks show central cavities, rings, or spiral arms likely
caused by low-mass stellar or planetary companions, yet few such features are
conclusively tied to bodies embedded in the disks. We note that even small
features on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the starlight grazes the
surface. We therefore focus on accurately computing the disk's thickness, which
depends on its temperature. We present models with temperatures set by the
balance between starlight heating and radiative cooling, that are also in
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\oplus$,
ranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a
deep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's
appearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight
heating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in
scattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by
another more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall
and shadow for the 1000-M$_\oplus$ planet is an order of magnitude greater than
a model neglecting the temperature disturbances. The shadow is so deep it
largely hides the planet-launched spiral wave's outer arm. Temperature
gradients are such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration
will converge within the shadow. Furthermore the temperature perturbations
affect the shape, size, and contrast of features at millimeter and centimeter
wavelengths. Thus radiative heating and cooling are key to the appearance of
protostellar disks with embedded planets.

implications from multiple standpoints, including impact on the crop commodity

rating. The focus of this work is to construct a corn yield predictor at the
county scale. Corn yield (forecasting) depends on a complex, interconnected set
of variables that include economic, agricultural, management and meteorological
factors. Conventional forecasting is either knowledge-based computer programs
(that simulate plant-weather-soil-management interactions) coupled with
targeted surveys or statistical model based. The former is limited by the need
for painstaking calibration, while the latter is limited to univariate analysis
or similar simplifying assumptions that fail to capture the complex
interdependencies affecting yield. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
approach that is ""gray box"" i.e. that seamlessly utilizes expert knowledge in
constructing a statistical network model for corn yield forecasting. Our
multivariate gray box model is developed on Bayesian network analysis to build
a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) between predictors and yield. Starting from a
complete graph connecting various carefully chosen variables and yield, expert
knowledge is used to prune or strengthen edges connecting variables.
Subsequently the structure (connectivity and edge weights) of the DAG that
maximizes the likelihood of observing the training data is identified via
optimization. We curated an extensive set of historical data (1948-2012) for
each of the 99 counties in Iowa as data to train the model.

many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying

reconfigurable spin current logic circuits. The concept relies on electrical
gating of carrier density dependent conductivity and spin diffusion length in
graphene. As a demo, GSDM is realized for both single-layer and bilayer
graphene. The distribution and propagation of spin current in the two branches
of GSDM depend on spin relaxation characteristics of graphene. Compared with
Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, D'yakonov-Perel mechanism results in
more appreciable gate-tuning performance. These unique features of GSDM would
give rise to abundant spin logic applications, such as on-chip spin current
modulators and reconfigurable spin logic circuits.

convexifies the nonlinear dynamics, via a linearization, in a successive
manner. Thus at each succession, a convex optimal control subproblem is solved.
Since the dynamics are linearized and other constraints are convex, after a
discretization, the subproblem can be expressed as a finite dimensional convex
programming subproblem. Since convex optimization problems can be solved very
efficiently, especially with custom solvers, this subproblem can be solved in
time-critical applications, such as real-time path planning for autonomous
vehicles. Several safe-guarding techniques are incorporated into the algorithm,
namely virtual control and trust regions, which add another layer of
algorithmic robustness. A convergence analysis is presented in continuous- time
setting. By doing so, our convergence results will be independent from any
numerical schemes used for discretization. Numerical simulations are performed
for an illustrative trajectory optimization example.

  Outcomes","38 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,,,"stat.ME econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantile and quantile effect functions are important tools for descriptive
and causal analyses due to their natural and intuitive interpretation. Existing
inference methods for these functions do not apply to discrete random
variables. This paper offers a simple, practical construction of simultaneous
confidence bands for quantile and quantile effect functions of possibly
discrete random variables. It is based on a natural transformation of
simultaneous confidence bands for distribution functions, which are readily
available for many problems. The construction is generic and does not depend on
the nature of the underlying problem. It works in conjunction with parametric,
semiparametric, and nonparametric modeling methods for observed and
counterfactual distributions, and does not depend on the sampling scheme. We
apply our method to characterize the distributional impact of insurance
coverage on health care utilization and obtain the distributional decomposition
of the racial test score gap. We find that universal insurance coverage
increases the number of doctor visits across the entire distribution, and that
the racial test score gap is small at early ages but grows with age due to
socio economic factors affecting child development especially at the top of the
distribution. These are new, interesting empirical findings that complement
previous analyses that focused on mean effects only. In both applications, the
outcomes of interest are discrete rendering existing inference methods invalid
for obtaining uniform confidence bands for observed and counterfactual quantile
functions and for their difference -- the quantile effects functions.

The compelling need for cross-source point cloud registration is motivated by
the rapid development of a variety of 3D sensing techniques, but many existing
registration methods face critical challenges as a result of the large
variations in cross-source point clouds. This paper therefore illustrates a
novel registration method which successfully aligns two cross-source point
clouds in the presence of significant missing data, large variations in point
density, scale difference and so on. The robustness of the method is attributed
to the extraction of macro and micro structures. Our work has three main
contributions: (1) a systematic pipeline to deal with cross-source point cloud
registration; (2) a graph construction method to maintain macro and micro
structures; (3) a new graph matching method is proposed which considers the
global geometric constraint to robustly register these variable graphs.
Compared to most of the related methods, the experiments show that the proposed
method successfully registers in cross-source datasets, while other methods
have difficulty achieving satisfactory results. The proposed method also shows
great ability in same-source datasets.

galactic nuclei (AGN), 60% are Type 2 AGN and 2% are passive, low-redshift
galaxies. We study the distribution of AGN photon index and of the intrinsic
absorption N(H,z) based on the sources optical classification: Type 1 have a
slightly steeper mean photon index than Type 2 AGN, which on the other hand
have average intrinsic absorption ~3 times higher than Type 1 AGN. We find that
~15% of Type 1 AGN have N(H,z)>1E22 cm^(-2), i.e., are obscured according to
the X-ray spectral fitting; the vast majority of these sources have
L(2-10keV)>$1E44 erg/s. The existence of these objects suggests that optical
and X-ray obscuration can be caused by different phenomena, the X-ray
obscuration being for example caused by dust-free material surrounding the
inner part of the nuclei. ~18% of Type 2 AGN have N(H,z)<1E22 cm^(-2), and most
of these sources have low X-ray luminosities (L(2-10keV)<$1E43 erg/s). We
expect a part of these sources to be low-accretion, unobscured AGN lacking of
broad emission lines. Finally, we also find a direct proportional trend between
N(H,z) and host galaxy mass and star formation rate, although part of this
trend is due to a redshift selection effect.

contain information from multiple time steps ahead, is one of the most popular
forms of TD learning for linear function approximation. The reason is that
multi-step methods often yield substantially better performance than their
single-step counter-parts, due to a lower bias of the update targets. For
non-linear function approximation, however, single-step methods appear to be
the norm. Part of the reason could be that on many domains the popular
multi-step methods TD($\lambda$) and Sarsa($\lambda$) do not perform well when
combined with non-linear function approximation. In particular, they are very
susceptible to divergence of value estimates. In this paper, we identify the
reason behind this. Furthermore, based on our analysis, we propose a new
multi-step TD method for non-linear function approximation that addresses this
issue. We confirm the effectiveness of our method using two benchmark tasks

Derivations of the explicit normal-mode expressions for the Riemannian metric,

stabilities of the hydrodynamic (HD, $\alpha=0$) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD,
$\alpha\to0$) motions and the $O(\alpha)$ Hall-term effect in terms of the
Jacobi equation and the Riemannian sectional curvature tensor are presented,
where $\alpha$ represents the Hall-term strength parameter. It is very
interesting that the sectional curvatures of the MHD and HMHD systems between
two GEV modes were found to take both the positive (stable) and negative
(unstable) values, while that of the HD system between two complex helical
waves was observed to be negative definite. Moreover, for the MHD case,
negative sectional curvatures were found to occur only when mode interaction
was ""local,"" i.e., the wavenumber moduli of the main flow (say $p$) and
perturbation (say $k$) were close to each other ($k \approx p$). However, in
the nonlocal limit ($k \gg p$ or $k \ll p$), the sectional curvatures were
always positive. This result leads to the conjecture that the MHD interactions
mainly excite wavy or non-growing motions; however, some local interactions
cause dynamical instability that leads to chaotic or turbulent plasma motions.
Additionally, it was found that the tendencies of the $O(\alpha)$ effects are
opposite between the ion cyclotron and whistler modes. Comparison with
energy-Casimir method is discussed.

molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the ISM is the prototypical example of a
gas-grain reaction. In these reactions, an atom of hydrogen will strike a
surface, stick to it, and diffuse across it. When it encounters another
adsorbed hydrogen atom, the two can react to form molecular hydrogen and then
be ejected from the surface by the energy released in the reaction. We perform
in-depth classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hydrogen atoms

first step in the formation process; the sticking of the hydrogen atom to the

sticking event will affect the computed sticking probabilities and
coefficients. Here, using our new definition of a sticking event, we report
sticking probabilities and sticking coefficients for nine different incident

with earlier numerical results. Applying the analysis to the first stars and
galaxies, we find that the kinematic stage is able to generate a field strength
only an order of magnitude smaller than the final saturation value. But the
generation of large-scale magnetic fields can only be accounted for by the
relatively inefficient nonlinear stage and requires longer time than the
free-fall time. It suggests that magnetic fields may not have played a
dynamically important role during the formation of the first stars.

an isostructural phase transition at which the N-N distance has a sudden drop,

transition, during which the magnetic moments transfer from the N(2p)
sublattice to the Mo(4d) sublattice, meanwhile the type of magnetic coupling is
changed from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic. We provide a physical picture
for understanding these striking effects. The discovery is not only of great

applying the same established quorum set theory. Cycle-based optical network
routing, whether using SONET rings or p-cycles, provides the sufficient

applying the distributed efficiency of the quorum sets to routing optical

unicast and multicast communication requests do not need to be known or even
modeled a priori. Additionally, in the presence of network link faults, greater

financial time series modeling (connected to the study of the GARCH($p,q$)

importantly, a new characterization of the constant $C_A$. Finally, we describe
the large exceedance paths via two conditioned limit laws. In the first, we
show that conditioned on a large exceedance, the process $\{ V_n\}$ follows an
exponentially-shifted Markov random walk, which we identify, thereby
generalizing results for classical random walk to matrix recursive sequences.
In the second, we characterize the empirical distribution of $\{ \log |V_n| -

obtain a high quality salient map. To achieve this goal, the DSRCNN is designed
based on VGGNet-16. Firstly, the recurrent connections are incorporated into
each convolutional layer, which can make the model more powerful for learning
the contextual information. Secondly, side-output layers are added to conduct
the deeply-supervised operation, which can make the model learn more
discriminative and robust features by effecting the intermediate layers.
Finally, all of the side-outputs are fused to integrate the local and global

yet it is extremely challenging to automate it in real-world images, which
typically contain considerable background clutter. In contrast to existing
cutout methods, which are based mainly on low-level image analysis, we propose
a more holistic approach, which considers the entire shape of the object of
interest by leveraging higher-level image analysis and learnt global shape
priors. Specifically, we leverage a deep neural network (DNN) trained for
objects of a particular class (chairs) for realizing this mechanism. Given a
rectangular image region, the DNN outputs a probability map (P-map) that
indicates for each pixel inside the rectangle how likely it is to be contained
inside an object from the class of interest. We show that the resulting P-maps
may be used to evaluate how likely a rectangle proposal is to contain an
instance of the class, and further process good proposals to produce an
accurate object cutout mask. This amounts to an automatic end-to-end pipeline
for catergory-specific object cutout. We evaluate our approach on segmentation
benchmark datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art on them.

estimating responses at the individual-level is valuable for personalizing

observational data containing sequential treatment assignments. However, past

population level. We leverage the G-computation formula and develop a novel
Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) method that can flexibly model functional data and
provide posterior inference over the treatment response curves at both the
individual and population level. On a challenging dataset containing time

Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer

the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits.
The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a
representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed
architecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network
and cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy

ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture

synthesis (SPS) code specifically designed to reconstruct the IMF. We implement
a novel approach combining regularization with hierarchical Bayesian inference.
Within this approach we use a parametrized IMF prior to regulate a direct
inference of the IMF. This direct inference gives more freedom to the IMF and
allows the model to deviate from parametrized models when demanded by the data.
We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to reconstruct the best
parameters for the IMF prior, the age, and the metallicity of a single stellar
population. We present our code and apply our model to a number of mock single
stellar populations with different ages, metallicities, and IMFs. When
systematic uncertainties are not significant, we are able to reconstruct the
input parameters that were used to create the mock populations. Our results
show that if systematic uncertainties do play a role, this may introduce a bias
on the results. Therefore, it is important to objectively compare different
ingredients of SPS models. Through its Bayesian framework, our model is

well-known boundary integral equation must be amended with two additional terms
containing the volume flux through the bubble surface. We rigorously prove the
existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our proof contains as a subset the
simpler boundary integral equation without volume-changing objects (such as red
blood cell or capsule suspensions) which is widely used but for which a formal
proof in periodic domains has not been published to date.
  In the second part, we apply our method to study microbubbles for targeted
drug delivery. The ideal drug delivery agent should stay away from the
biochemically active vessel walls during circulation. However, upon reaching
its target it should attain a near-wall position for efficient drug uptake.
Though seemingly contradictory, we show that lipid-coated microbubbles in
conjunction with a localized ultrasound pulse possess precisely these two
properties. This ultrasound-triggered margination is due to hydrodynamic
interactions between the red blood cells and the oscillating lipid-coated
microbubbles which alternate between a soft and a stiff state. We find that the
effect is very robust, existing even if the duration in the stiff state is more
than three times lower than the opposing time in the soft state.

Fourier amplitude, the object phase information is naturally and inherently
encoded in scattered light bispectrum (the Fourier transform of

depth camera, e.g. Kinect, by exploiting shading cues captured from an infrared
(IR) camera. A major benefit to using an IR camera instead of an RGB camera is
that the IR images captured are narrow band images that filter out most
undesired ambient light, which makes our system robust against natural indoor
illumination. Moreover, for many natural objects with colorful textures in the
visible spectrum, the subjects appear to have a uniform albedo in the IR
spectrum. Based on our analyses on the IR projector light of the Kinect, we
define a near light source IR shading model that describes the captured
intensity as a function of surface normals, albedo, lighting direction, and
distance between light source and surface points. To resolve the ambiguity in
our model between the normals and distances, we utilize an initial 3D mesh from
the Kinect fusion and multi-view information to reliably estimate surface
details that were not captured and reconstructed by the Kinect fusion. Our
approach directly operates on the mesh model for geometry refinement. We ran
experiments on our algorithm for geometries captured by both the Kinect I and
Kinect II, as the depth acquisition in Kinect I is based on a structured-light
technique and that of the Kinect II is based on a time-of-flight (ToF)
technology. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through several
challenging real-world examples. We have also performed a user study to
evaluate the quality of the mesh models before and after our refinements.

programs that find one or more solutions of a geometric constraint problem. If
no solution exists, the solver is expected to announce that no solution has
been found. Owing to the complexity, type or difficulty of a constraint
problem, it is possible that the solver does not find a solution even though
one may exist. Thus, there may be false negatives, but there should never be
false positives. Intuitively, the ability to find solutions can be considered a
measure of solver's competence. We consider static constraint problems and
their solvers. We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as
dynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,
interactively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining
all stipulated constraints. However, if we have a solver for static constraint
problems that is sufficiently fast and competent, we can build a dynamic
geometry program from it by solving the static problem for a sufficiently dense
sampling of the trajectory of the moving element(s). The work we survey has its
roots in applications, especially in mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD).
The constraint solvers used in MCAD took a quantum leap in the 1990s. These
approaches solve a geometric constraint problem by an initial, graph-based
structural analysis that extracts generic subproblems and determines how they
would combine to form a complete solution. These subproblems are then handed to
an algebraic solver that solves the specific instances of the generic
subproblems and combines them.

that a system evolving in the presence of noise which has its dynamical state
concealed from quantifiers like the power spectrum and correlation dimension
D2, can be revealed using the bicoherence function. We define an index called
main peak bicoherence function as the bicoherence associated with the maximal
power spectral peak. We show that this index is extremely useful while dealing
with quasi-periodic data as it can distinguish strange non chaos from quasi
periodicity even with added noise. We demonstrate this in a real world
scenario, by taking the bicoherence of variable stars showing period doubling
and strange non-chaotic behavior. Our results indicate that bicoherence
analysis can also bypass the method of surrogate analysis using Fourier phase
randomization, used to differentiate linear stochastic processes from non
linear ones, in conventional methods involving measures like D2.

governed by repulsive Coulomb forces. However, rare cases exist where local
attractive interactions emerge and prevail in determining the ground state of
the system despite the dominant Coulomb repulsion. The most notable example is
no doubt electron pairing, which leads to superconductivity and is mediated by
electron phonon coupling or more intricate mechanisms such as antiferromagnetic
spin order in high-temperature superconductors. The interplay of attractive and
repulsive interaction components may also instigate spontaneous symmetry
lowering and clustering of charges in geometric patterns such as bubbles and
stripes, provided these interactions act on different length scales. In
high-temperature superconductors, for instance, fluctuating stripe or nematic
ordering is intertwined with superconductivity itself. Both types of attractive
interaction based physics, pairing and charge ordering, are also at play in
high-quality two-dimensional electron systems exposed to a quantizing
perpendicular magnetic field for electrons describing larger orbits. This has
been concluded indirectly from the transport behaviour when such phases form.
An unambiguous manifestation of an underlying attractive interaction between
the electrons has however remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a
negative permittivity as an immediate consequence of local attractive
interaction rather than repulsion among the electrons when bubble and stripe
phases form. The implemented technique based on surface acoustic waves offers
directionality and confirms the stripe phase to be a strongly anisotropic
medium.

security of users in the target cell in the presence of pilot contamination
using a stochastic geometry approach. The analytical results of the average

central cores in the mass profiles of low-mass halos, a process that is
attributed to star formation-related baryonic feedback. Core creation is
regarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by
the lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,
the reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational
velocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the
seeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called ""too big
to fail"" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological
issues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen
(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical
simulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce
the kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc. However, the
agreement with observations becomes poor once galaxies with kinematic
measurements extending beyond the core region, R ~ 1.5 - 4 kpc, are considered.
This result illustrates the importance of testing the predictions of
hydrodynamical simulations that are relevant for cosmology against a broad
range of observational samples. We would like to stress that our result is
valid only under the following set of assumptions: i) that our sample of dwarfs
with HI kinematics is representative of the overall population of field dwarfs,
ii) that there are no severe measurement biases in the observational parameters
of our HI dwarfs (e.g., related to inclination estimates), and iii) that the HI
velocity fields of dwarfs are regular enough to allow the recovery of the true

semiconducting with a direct band gap of ~0.8 eV, which is quite different from
those obtained previously using standard functionals. Detailed analysis of a
three-dimensional energy band structure indicates that there is a valley
degeneracy of eight around the valence band maximum, which leads to a sharp
density of states and is responsible for a large p-type Seebeck coefficient.
Moreover, we find that the density of states effective masses are much larger

get dynamically localized when periodic $\delta$-function kicks are applied

study the effects of interactions in three different models in one dimension.
The systems we have considered include spinless fermions with interactions
between nearest-neighbor sites, the Hubbard model of spin-1/2 fermions, and the
Bose Hubbard model with on-site interactions. We derive effective Floquet
Hamiltonians up to second order in the time period of kicking. Using these we
show that interactions can give rise to a variety of interesting results such
as two-body bound states in all three models and dispersionless many-body bound
states for spinless fermions and bosons. We substantiate these results by exact
diagonalization and stroboscopic time evolution of systems with a finite number
of particles. We derive a low-energy pseudo-spin-1/2 limit of the Bose Hubbard
system in the thermodynamic limit and show that a special case of this has an
exponentially large number of ground states. Finally we study the effect of
changing the strength of the $\delta$-function kicks slightly away from perfect
dynamical localization; we find that a single particle remains dynamically
localized for a long time after which it moves ballistically.

analysis. We assume diffusion is sufficient to suppress solute concentration
gradients across but not along the film. The solute field beneath the bulk of
the drop is stretched by the spreading flow, such that the initial solute
concentration immediately behind the drop's effective contact lines has a
long-lived influence on the spreading rate. Over long periods, solute swept up

scenario unchanged. For the system with larger repulsive step at high densities
the conventional first-order transition takes place without random pinning.
However, in the presence of disorder the single first-order transition
transforms into two transitions, one of them (solid-hexatic) is the continuous
KTHNY-like transition, while the hexatic to isotropic liquid transition occurs

Fibonacci chains, have been investigated in terms of their electronic
properties. The system is described by a tight binding Hamiltonian. The
eigenvalue spectrum of such a multi-strand quasiperiodic network is found to be
sensitive on the mutual values of the intra-strand and inter-strand tunnel
hoppings, whose distribution displays a unique three-subband self-similar
pattern in a parameter subspace. In addition, it is observed that special
numerical correlations between the nearest and the next-nearest neighbor
hopping integrals can render a substantial part of the energy spectrum
absolutely continuous. Extended, Bloch like functions populate the above
continuous zones, signalling a complete delocalization of single particle
states even in such a non-translationally invariant system, and more
importantly, a phenomenon that can be engineered by tuning the relative
strengths of the hopping parameters. A commutation relation between the
potential and the hopping matrices enables us to work out the precise
correlation which helps to engineer the extended eigenfunctions and determine
the band positions at will.

theory of outer automorphisms is pedagogically introduced and it is shown that
CP transformations are special outer automorphisms of the global, local, and

allow for a group theoretical prediction of parameter independent CP violating
complex phases with fixed geometrical values. The remainder of this thesis
pioneers the study of outer automorphisms which are not related to C, P, or T.
It is shown how outer automorphisms, in general, relate symmetry invariants
and, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, imply relations between
different vacuum expectation values. Thereby, outer automorphisms can give rise
to emergent symmetries. An example model with a discrete symmetry and three
copies of the Standard Model Higgs field is discussed, in which the rich outer
automorphism structure completely fixes the Higgs VEVs in their field space
direction, including CP violating relative phases. This underlies the
phenomenon of spontaneous geometrical CP violation. The possible relevance of
outer automorphisms for a wide field of future studies is highlighted.

this paper, we propose an energy-optimization framework guided by a source code
energy model that allows developers to be aware of energy usage induced by the
code and to apply very targeted source-level refactoring strategies. The
framework also lays a foundation for the code optimization by automatic tools.

high-level language such as Java. In a case study, the experimental evaluation
shows that our approach is able to save from 6.4% to 50.2% of the CPU energy

several patterns can be observed. These patterns are caused by different
sources of uncertainty, which affect the repeatability of the scanner. The
purpose of this work was to study these uncertainties.
  Methods: The variance of the scanner noise, as a function of the pixel
position, was studied for different resolutions. The inter-scan variability of
the scanner response was analyzed taking into account spatial discrepancies.
Finally, the distance between the position of the same point in different scans
was examined.
  Results: The variance of noise follows periodical patterns in both axes,
causing the grid patterns. These patterns were identified for resolutions of
50, 72 and 96 dpi, but not for 150 dpi. Specially recognizable is the
sinusoidal shape with a period of 8.5 mm that is produced with 72 dpi.
Inter-scan variations of the response caused systematic relative dose
deviations larger than 1% in 5% of the red channel images, 9% of the green and
51% of the blue. No systematic deviation larger than 1% was found after
applying response corrections. The initial positioning and the speed of the
scanner lamp vary between scans.
  Conclusions: Three new sources of uncertainty, which influence radiochromic
film dosimetry with flatbed scanners, have been identified and analyzed in this
work: grid patterns, spatial inter-scan variations and scanning reading
repeatability. A novel correction method is proposed, which mitigates spatial
inter-scan variations caused by deviations in the autocalibration of the

starless clumps, the protostellar clumps are more luminous, more turbulent and
lie in regions where the filamentary ambient gas shows larger linewidths. We
see evidence of gas flowing along the main filament, but we do not find any
signs of accretion flow from the filament onto the Hi-GAL clumps. We analyze
the radial column density profile of the filaments and their gravitational
stability. The more massive and highly fragmented main filament appears to be
thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound, assuming that all of the
non-thermal motion is contributing thermal-like support, suggesting a later
stage of evolution compared to the secondary filament. The status and
evolutionary phase of the Hi-GAL clumps would then appear to correlate with

the structure of the interaction contexts, and combine it with the spatial and

we provide here, involves the computation of the infimum of an expression which
involves the ""transverse"" component of the algebra element in addition to the
""longitudinal"" component of [1]. This renders the formula less user-friendly,
as the determination of the exact transverse component for which the infimum is
reached remains a non-trivial task, but under rather generic conditions it
turns out that the Connes' distance is proportional to the trace norm of the
difference in the density matrices, leading to considerable simplification. In
addition, we can determine an upper bound of the distance by emulating and
adapting the approach of [2] in our Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation. We
then look for an optimal element for which the upper bound is reached. We are
able to find one for the Moyal plane through the limit of a sequence obtained
by finite dimensional projections of the representative of an element belonging
to a multiplier algebra, onto the subspaces of the total Hilbert space,
occurring in the spectral triple and spanned by the eigen-spinors of the
respective Dirac operator. This is in contrast with the fuzzy sphere, where the
upper bound, which is given by the geodesic of a commutative sphere is never
reached for any finite $n$-representation of $SU(2)$. Indeed, for the case of
maximal non-commutativity ($n = 1/2$), the finite distance is shown to coincide
exactly with the above mentioned lower bound, with the transverse component
playing no role. This, however starts changing from $n=1$ onwards and we try to
improve the estimate of the finite distance and provide an almost exact result,

will converge to different solutions depending on initial conditions. In this
paper we ask: is it possible to assess how far we are from the global maximum
of the likelihood? Since the likelihood of a finite mixture model can grow
unboundedly by centering a Gaussian on a single datapoint and shrinking the
covariance, we constrain the problem by assuming that the parameters of the
individual models are members of a large discrete set (e.g. estimating a
mixture of two Gaussians where the means and variances of both Gaussians are
members of a set of a million possible means and variances). For this setting
we show that a simple upper bound on the likelihood can be computed using
convex optimization and we analyze conditions under which the bound is
guaranteed to be tight. This bound can then be used to assess the quality of
solutions found by EM (where the final result is projected on the discrete set)
or any other mixture estimation algorithm. For any dataset our method allows us
to find a finite mixture model together with a dataset-specific bound on how

to measure the electromagnetic spectral function of QCD matter as a function of
both invariant mass and momentum. In particular we report on recent progress on
how the medium modifications of the (dominant) isovector part of the vector
current correlator ($\rho$ channel) can shed light on the mechanism of chiral
symmetry restoration in the hot and/or dense environment. In addition, thermal
dilepton radiation enables novel access to (a) the fireball lifetime through
the dilepton yield in the low invariant-mass window $0.3 \; \mathrm{GeV} \leq M

to a speed of $v\sim 0.2$c, capable of reaching the nearest star system,
$\alpha$ Centauri, in about 20 years. However, a critical challenge for the
initiative is the damage to the spacecraft by interstellar gas and dust during
the journey. In this paper, we quantify the interaction of a relativistic
spacecraft with gas and dust in the interstellar medium. For gas bombardment,
we find that damage by track formation due to heavy elements is an important
effect. We find that gas bombardment can potentially damage the surface of the
spacecraft to a depth of $\sim 0.1$ mm for quartz material after traversing a
gas column of $N_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^{18}\rm cm^{-2}$ along the path to
$\alpha$ Centauri, whereas the effect is much weaker for graphite material. The
effect of dust bombardment erodes the spacecraft surface and produces numerous
craters due to explosive evaporation of surface atoms. For a spacecraft speed
$v=0.2c$, we find that dust bombardment can erode a surface layer of $\sim 0.5$
mm thickness after the spacecraft has swept a column density of $N_{\rm H}\sim
3\times 10^{17}\rm cm^{-2}$, assuming the standard gas-to-dust ratio of the
interstellar medium. Dust bombardment also damages the spacecraft surface by
modifying the material structure through melting. We calculate the equilibrium
surface temperature due to collisional heating by gas atoms as well as the
temperature profile as a function of depth into the spacecraft. Our
quantitative results suggest methods for damage control, and we highlight
possibilities for shielding strategies and protection of the spacecraft.

assess model adequacy amidst a rapidly evolving epidemic environment,
substantially reducing computation time in comparison to standard MCMC, to
ensure timely delivery of real-time epidemic assessments. In application to

Focusing on quark production for definiteness, we establish a new factorization
scheme, perturbatively correct through NLO, in which there is no `rapidity

explicitly separated from the high-energy evolution. Our construction exploits
the skeleton structure of the (NLO) Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, in which the
first step of the evolution is explicitly singled out. The NLO impact factor is
included by computing this first emission with the exact kinematics for the
emitted gluon, rather than by using the eikonal approximation. This particular
calculation has already been presented in the literature [1,2], but the
reorganization of the perturbation theory that we propose is new. As compared
to the proposal in [1,2], our scheme is free of the fine-tuning inherent in the
rapidity subtraction, which might be the origin of the negativity of the NLO
cross-section observed in previous studies.

data gathering technologies, some interactions might be missing from the
network model. This is a ubiquitous problem in all domains that use network
analysis, from social networks to hyper-linked web networks to biological
networks. Consequently, an important question in analyzing networks is to
understand how increasing the noise level (i.e. percentage of missing edges)
affects different network parameters.
  In this paper we evaluate the effect of noise on community scoring and
centrality-based parameters with respect to two different aspects of network
analysis: (i) sensitivity, that is how the parameter value changes as edges are
removed and (ii) reliability in the context of message spreading, that is how
the time taken to broadcast a message changes as edges are removed.
  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world networks and three different
noise models demonstrate that for both the aspects over all networks and all
noise models, permanence qualifies as the most effective metric. For the
sensitivity experiments closeness centrality is a close second. For the message
spreading experiments, closeness and betweenness centrality based initiator
selection closely competes with permanence. This is because permanence has a
dual characteristic where the cumulative permanence over all vertices is
sensitive to noise but the ids of the top-rank vertices, which are used to find
seeds during message spreading remain relatively stable under noise.

orbital and spin-correlation functions indicates that the orbital ordering
occurs before the onset of magnetic correlations in this parameter regime as a
function of temperature. In the OSMP, we find that the self-energy for the
itinerant electrons is momentum dependent, indicating a degree of non-local
correlations while the localized electrons have largely momentum independent
self-energies. These non-local correlations also produce relative shifts of the

transparent formalisation, and a geometrical perspective for better
understanding the resulting equations. The effect of the evolution of the basis
set within the spanned Hilbert space separates explicitly from the effect of
the turning of the space itself when moving in parameter space, as the tangent
space turns when moving in a curved space. New insights are obtained using
familiar concepts in that context such as the Riemann curvature. The
differential geometry is not strictly that for curved spaces as in general
relativity, a more adequate mathematical framework being provided by fibre
bundles. The language used here, however, will be restricted to tensors and
basic quantum mechanics. The local gauge implied by a smoothly varying basis
set readily connects with Berry's formalism for geometric phases. Generalised
expressions for the Berry connection and curvature are obtained for a
parameter-dependent occupied Hilbert space spanned by non-orthogonal Wannier
functions. The formalism is applicable to basis sets made of atomic-like
orbitals and also more adaptative moving basis functions (such as in methods
using Wannier functions as intermediate or support bases), but should also
apply to other situations in which non-orthogonal functions or related
projectors should arise. The formalism is applied to the time-dependent quantum

electron emission in collisions of (molecular) ions with atoms. The model is
based on the Boltzmann population of the bound electronic energy levels of the
quasi molecule formed in the collision and the discretized continuum. The
discretization of the continuum is implemented by a free electron gas in a box
model assuming an effective square potential of the quasi molecule. The
temperature of the electron gas is calculated by taking into account a
thermodynamically adiabatic process due to the change of the effective volume
of the quasi molecule as the system evolves. The system may undergo a
transition with a small probability from the discretized continuum to the
states of the complementary continuum. It is assumed that these states are
decoupled from the thermodynamic time development. The decoupled states
overwhelmingly determine the yield of the asymptotically observed fragment
ions. The main motivation of this work is to describe the recently observed
$H^-$ ion production in $OH^+ + Ar$ collisions. The obtained differential cross
sections for $H^-$ formation, cation production and electron emission are close
to the experimental ones. Calculations for the atomic systems $O^+ + Ar$ and
$H^+ + Ar$ are also in reasonable agreement with the experiments indicating
that the model can be applied to a wide class of collisions.

central challenge in modern quantitative science. We present a universal,

This work combines Takens' delay embedding with modern Koopman operator theory
and sparse regression to obtain linear representations of strongly nonlinear
dynamics. The result is a decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model
in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low energy delay coordinates;
we call this the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This
analysis is applied to the canonical Lorenz system, as well as to real-world
examples such as the Earth's magnetic field reversal, and data from
electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and measles outbreaks. In each case,
the forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare
events that trigger intermittent switching and bursting phenomena; this forcing
is highly predictive, providing a clear signature that precedes these events.
Moreover, the activity of the forcing signal demarcates large coherent regions
of phase space where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are
strongly nonlinear.

Networks (DTNs). We first formulate the content delivery interaction as a
non-cooperative satisfaction game. On one hand, the source node seeks to ensure
a delivery probability above some given threshold. On the other hand, the relay
nodes seek to maximize their own payoffs. The source node offers a reward
(virtual coins) to the relay which caches and forwards the file to the final
destination. Each relay faces the dilemma of accepting/rejecting to cache the
source's file. Cooperation incurs energy cost due to caching, carrying and
forwarding the source's file. Yet, when a relay accepts to cooperate, it may
receive some reward if it succeeds to be the first relay to forward the content
to the destination. Otherwise, the relay may receive some penalty in the form
of a constant regret; the latter parameter is introduced to make incentive for
cooperation. Next, we introduce the concept of Satisfaction Equilibrium (SE) as
a solution concept to the induced game. Now, the source node is solely
interested in reaching a file delivery probability greater than some given
threshold, while the relays behave rationally to maximize their respective
payoffs. Full characterizations of the SEs for both pure and mixed strategies
are derived. Furthermore, we propose two learning algorithms allowing the
players (source/relays) to reach the SE strategies. Finally, extensive
numerical investigations and some learning simulations are carried out to
illustrate the behaviour of the interacting nodes.

macroscopic processes (e.g. a bicycle pump) also the action constant takes
macroscopically observable values. We discuss the finite time Carnot cycle, and
estimate the lower bound for irreversible work required when rewriting

statistics in a developing economy, thereby defining an alternative
\enquote{poverty index} (PI) that largely agreed with poverty gap index data.
This PI used two variables, the probability density function of the income
statistics and a consumption deprivation (CD) function, representing the
shortfall in the minimum consumption needed for survival. Since the time
dependence of the CD function was introduced there through data extrapolation
only and not through an endogenous time dependent series, this model left
unexplained how the minimum consumption needed for survival varies with time.
The present article overcomes these limitations and arrives at a new unified
theoretical structure through time varying consumption and income distributions
where trade is only allowed when the income exceeds consumption deprivation
(CD). Our results reveal that such CD-dynamics reduces the threshold level of
consumption of basic necessities, suggesting a possible dietary transition in
terms of lower saturation level of food-grain consumption. The new poverty
index conforms to recently observed trends more closely than conventional
measures of poverty and allows probabilistic prediction of PI for future times.

separation for the case of QED, which stems from the recent controversy
concerning the proper definitions of the orbital angular momentum and spin
operator of the individual parts of a gauge field system. For the free quantum
electrodynamics without matter, we show that the basic requirement of Euclidean
symmetry selects a unique physical angular momentum separation scheme from the
multitude of the possible angular momentum separation schemes constructed using
the various Gauge Invariant Extentions. Based on these results, we propose a
set of natural angular momentum separation schemes for the case of interacting
QED by invoking the formalism of asymptotic fields. Some perspectives on such a
problem for the case of QCD are briefly discussed.

Drive and Dropbox, require access to the user's data in order to provide some
functionality. Through detailed analysis of a hundred popular Google Drive apps
from Google's Chrome store, we discover that the existing permission model is
quite often misused: around two thirds of analyzed apps are over-privileged,
i.e., they access more data than is needed for them to function. In this work,
we analyze three different permission models that aim to discourage users from
installing over-privileged apps. In experiments with 210 real users, we
discover that the most successful permission model is our novel ensemble method
that we call Far-reaching Insights. Far-reaching Insights inform the users
about the data-driven insights that apps can make about them (e.g., their
topics of interest, collaboration and activity patterns etc.) Thus, they seek
to bridge the gap between what third parties can actually know about users and
users perception of their privacy leakage. The efficacy of Far-reaching
Insights in bridging this gap is demonstrated by our results, as Far-reaching
Insights prove to be, on average, twice as effective as the current model in
discouraging users from installing over-privileged apps. In an effort for
promoting general privacy awareness, we deploy a publicly available privacy
oriented app store that uses Far-reaching Insights. Based on the knowledge
extracted from data of the store's users (over 115 gigabytes of Google Drive
data from 1440 users with 662 installed apps), we also delineate the ecosystem
for third-party cloud apps from the standpoint of developers and cloud
providers. Finally, we present several general recommendations that can guide
other future works in the area of privacy for the cloud.

non-Abelian gauge theories. The operator Yang-Mills equation is written, which
on the corresponding averaging gives an infinite set of equations for all Green
functions. We split all degrees of freedom into two groups: in the former, we
have $A^a_\mu \in \mathcal G \subset SU(N)$, and in the second group we have
coset degrees of freedom $SU(N) / \mathcal G$. Using such splitting and some
assumptions about 2- and 4-point Green functions, we truncate the infinite set
of equations to two equations. The first equation is for the gauge fields from
the subgroup $\mathcal G$, and the second equation is for a gluon condensate
which is the dispersion of quantum fluctuations of the coset fields. Two
examples are considered: The first one is a flux tube solution describing
longitudinal color electric fields stretched between quark and antiquark
located at the $\pm$ infinities. The second one is a flux tube stretched
between two quarks (antiquarks) located at $\pm \infty$. A special case is
considered when the longitudinal electric field produced by a quark located at
$+ \infty$ is equal and oppositely directed to the field generated by a quark
located at $- \infty$ that leads to zero total electric field. Both solutions
represents the dual Meissner effect: the electric field is pushed out from the
gluon condensate.

Finally, we generalise the construction of thick accretion tori (""Polish

transfers this energy almost perfectly at room temperature RT to a Reaction
Center RC, where charge separation occurs. While there are a number of possible
light absorbers involved in this process, our focus is the B850 and B875
complexes. We propose that the dominant feature of the ground states in the
B850 ring and the B875 open chain are pseudo one dimensional metals due to each
bacteriochlorophyll a BChl containing a coordinated magnesium ion Mg2+. The Mg
ion structure undergoes a static Peierls distortion that results in symmetry
breaking that changes the even spacing of the Mg/BChl molecules comprising the
chains to the experimentally observed Mg/BChl dimers. The results are charge
density waves CDW, one for each type of the two complexes that result in an
energy gap in the single particle electronic spectrum and coherent phonon s
spanning the entire rings. The ground state CDWs seem to have two functions the
first is to form a stable optical platform and the second is to suppress
radical formation and energy dissipation of the coherent excited state by
creating single particle energy gaps. After excitation by a photon, the B850
exciton delocalizes on the ring a second photon can form a two-level exciton
polariton that could be an alternative explanation for the splitting of the
B850 exciton band. The coherent polariton formed could actively participate in
uphill electronic energy transfer EET. Additionally we suggest other possible
energy storage mechanisms and entanglement possibilities. We suggest
experimental studies to clarify these proposals.

technology, especially with High dielectric constant (High-\k{appa}/HK) metal
gate (MG) transistors. In addition, the time independent process induced
variation has also increased because of the aggressive scaling down of devices.
As a result, the faster devices at the lower threshold voltage distribution
tail experience higher stress, leading to additional skewness in the BTI
degradation. Since time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and
stress-induced leakage current (SILC) in NMOS devices are correlated to BTI, it
is necessary to investigate the effect of time zero variability on all these
effects simultaneously. To that effect, we propose a simulation framework to
model and analyze the impact of time-zero variability (in particular, random
dopant fluctuations) on different aging effects. For small area devices (~1000
nm2) in 30nm technology, we observe significant effect of Random Dopant
Fluctuation (RDF) on BTI induced variability ({\sigma}{\Delta}Vth). In
addition, the circuit analysis reveals similar trend on the performance
degradation. However, both TDDB and SILC show weak dependence on RDF. We
conclude that the effect of RDF on Vth degradation cannot be disregarded in
scaled technology and needs to be considered for variation tolerant circuit
design.

electricity tariff price forecasting tools are needed. In the presence of
effective forecasting tools, taking the decisions of production, merchandising,

can be successively and effectively done. According to the electricity demand,
there are four various electricity tariffs pricing in Turkey; monochromic, day,
peak and night. The objective is find the best suitable tool for predicting the
four pricing periods of electricity and produce short term forecasts (one year
ahead-monthly). Our approach based on finding the best model, which ensures the
smallest forecasting error measurements of: MAPE, MAD and MSD. We conduct a
comparison of various forecasting approaches in total accounts for nine teen,
at least all of those have different aspects of methodology. Our beginning step
was doing forecasts for the year 2015. We validated and analyzed the
performance of our best model and made comparisons to see how well the
historical values of 2015 and forecasted data for that specific period matched.
Results show that given the time-series data, the recommended models provided
good forecasts. Second part of practice, we also include the year 2015, and
compute all the models with the time series of January 2011 to December 2015.
Again by choosing the best appropriate forecasting model, we conducted the
forecast process and also analyze the impact of enhancing of time series
periods (January 2007 to December 2015) to model that we used for forecasting
process.
