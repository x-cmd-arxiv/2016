first considered the Majumdar--Papapetrou solution for a binary of extreme
black holes in a previous paper, while here we deal with a Schwarzschild black
hole surrounded by a concentric thin ring described by the Bach--Weyl solution.
The geometry is again revealed on the simplest invariants determined by the
metric (lapse function) and its gradient (gravitational acceleration), and by
curvature (Kretschmann scalar). Extending the metric inside the black hole
along null geodesics tangent to the horizon, we mainly focus on the black-hole
interior (specifically, on its sections at constant Killing time) where the
quantities behave in a way indicating a surprisingly strong influence of the
external source. Being already distinct on the level of potential and
acceleration, this is still more pronounced on the level of curvature: for a
sufficiently massive and/or nearby (small) ring, the Kretschmann scalar even
becomes negative in certain toroidal regions mostly touching the horizon from
inside. Such regions have been interpreted as those where magnetic-type
curvature dominates, but here we deal with space-times which do {\em not}
involve rotation and the negative value is achieved due to the {\em
electric}-type components of the Riemann/Weyl tensor. The Kretschmann scalar
also shapes rather non-trivial landscapes {\em outside} the horizon.

rely on the precise manipulation of domain walls. The conventional approach
using static magnetic fields is inefficient due to the low susceptibility of
AFs. Recently proposed electrical manipulation with spin-orbit torques is
restricted to metals with a specific crystal structure.
  Here we propose an alternative, broadly applicable approach: using asymmetric
magnetic field pulses to induce controlled ratchet motion of AF domain walls.
  The efficiency of this approach is based on three peculiarities of AF
dynamics. First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order
parameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility
of the domain walls. Second, the rate of change of the magnetic field couples
with the spatial variation of the AF order parameter inside the domain and this
enables synchronous motion of multiple domain walls with the same structure.
Third, tailored asymmetric field pulses in combination with static friction can
prevent backward motion of domain walls and thus lead to the desired controlled
ratchet effect.
  The proposed use of an external field, rather than internal spin-orbit
torques, avoids any restrictions on size, conductivity, and crystal structure
of the AF material.
  We believe that our approach paves a way for the development of new AF-based
devices based on controlled motion of AF domain walls.

investigate the quantized dynamics as a consequence of ac pulses with large

time-dependent current in the Coulomb blockade regime. Our theory thus extends
previous models that considered either noninteracting electrons in nonlinear
response or interacting electrons in the linear regime. We prove that the
electron emission and absorption resonances undergo a splitting when the
charging energy is larger than the tunnel broadening. For very large charging
energies, the additional peaks collapse and the original resonances are
recovered, though with a reduced amplitude. Quantization of the charge emitted
by the capacitor is reduced due to Coulomb repulsion and additional plateaus
arise. Additionally, we discuss the differential capacitance and resistance as
a function of time. We find that to leading order in driving frequency the

finally, by deconvolving the spatio-temporal features we produce pixel-wise

faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty
quantification of predictions obtained when applying these forces in {\it ab
initio} calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is
the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review
with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the
field of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of
representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body
forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.

events that occur when a star encounters a supermassive black hole. We employ
the linear theory of warped accretion discs to find the shape of a disc for
which the stream arising from the disrupted star provides a source of angular
momentum that is misaligned with that of the black hole. For quasi-steady
configurations we find that when the warp diffusion or propagation time is
large compared to the local mass accretion time and/or the natural disc
alignment radius is small, misalignment is favoured. These results have been
verified using SPH simulations. We also simulated 1D model discs including gas
and radiation pressure. As accretion rates initially exceed the Eddington limit
the disc is initially advection dominated. Assuming the $\alpha$ model for the
disc, where it can be thermally unstable it subsequently undergoes cyclic
transitions between high and low states. During these transitions the aspect
ratio varies from $\sim 1$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ which is reflected in changes in
the degree of disc misalignment at the stream impact location. For maximal
black hole rotation and sufficiently large values of viscosity parameter
$\alpha > \sim 0.01-0.1$ the ratio of the disc inclination to that of the
initial stellar orbit is estimated to be $0.1-0.2$ in the advection dominated
state, while reaching of order unity in the low state. Misalignment descreases
with decrease of $\alpha$, but increases as the black hole rotation parameter
decreases. Thus, it is always significant when the latter is small.

wire antenna acting as an electric dipole, is shown to possess asymmetric
scattering properties. When illuminated from opposite directions with the same
polarization of the electric field, the structure has exactly the same forward
scattering, while the backward scattering is drastically different. The
scattering cross section is shown to be as low as zero at a narrow frequency
range when illuminated from one side, while being maximal at the same frequency

comparing networks produced by automated algorithms-natural language processing

networks from fiction have been already extracted by scientists, but the more
general framework surrounding these interactions was missing. We propose
several NLP methods for detecting interactions and test them against a range of
human perceptions. In doing so, we have pointed to some limitations of using

candidates for coherent heterostructure devices. In this report, spinodal
decomposition is proposed and experimentally implemented to produce epitaxial
double heterostructures in halide perovskite system. Pristine epitaxial mixed
halide perovskites rods and films were synthesized via Van der Waals epitaxy by
chemical vapor deposition method. At room temperature, photon was applied as a
knob to regulate the kinetics of spinodal decomposition and classic coarsening.
By this approach, halide perovskite double heterostructures were created
carrying epitaxial interfaces and outstanding optical properties. Reduced
Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon coupling was discovered in coherent halide double
heterostructure, which is hypothetically attributed to the classic phonon
confinement effect widely existing in III-V double heterostructures. The
ability to develop coherent double heterostructures in halide perovskites paves
an avenue to exploring halide perovskite-based quantum wells and superlattices
for high-performance and low-cost optoelectronics, electro-optics and

on local spin polarizations of Bloch states in non-magnetic, centrosymmetric
materials, the scope of spintronics has been significantly broadened. Here, we
show, using a framework that is universally applicable independent of whether
hidden spin polarizations are small (e.g., diamond, Si, Ge, and GaAs) or large
(e.g., MoS2 and WSe2), that the corresponding quantity arising from orbital -
instead of spin - degrees of freedom, the hidden orbital polarization, is (i)
much more abundant in nature since it exists even without spin-orbit coupling
and (ii) more fundamental since the interband matrix elements of the
site-dependent orbital angular momentum operator determines the hidden spin
polarization. We predict that the hidden spin polarization of transition metal
dichalcogenides is reduced significantly upon compression. We suggest
experimental signatures of hidden orbital polarization from photoemission
spectroscopies and demonstrate that the current-induced hidden orbital
polarization may play a far more important role than its spin counterpart in
antiferromagnetic information technology by calculating the current-driven
antiferromagnetism in compressed silicon.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider the uplink transmission while our
results are applicable to the downlink as well. The absence of CP increases the
spectral efficiency in expense of intersymbol interference (ISI) and
intercarrier interference (ICI). It is known that in massive MIMO, the effects
of uncorrelated noise and multiuser interference vanish as the number of base
station (BS) antennas tends to infinity. To investigate if the channel
distortions in the absence of CP fade away, we study the performance of the
standard maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver. Our analysis reveals that in
this receiver, there always remains some residual interference leading to
saturation of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To resolve this
problem, we propose to use the time reversal (TR) technique. Moreover, in order
to further reduce the multiuser interference, we propose a zero-forcing
equalization to be deployed after the TR combining. We compare the achievable
rate of the proposed system with that of the conventional CP-OFDM. We show that
in realistic channels, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved by removing the
CP from OFDM, while reducing the computational complexity.

CERN give a hint of possible violation of flavor in the leptonic decays of the
Higgs boson. In this work we analyze the flavor violating leptonic decays
$H^0_1\to l_i \bar l_j$ ($i\neq j$) within the framework of an MSSM extension
with a vectorlike leptonic generation. Specifically we focus on the decay mode
$H^0_1\to \mu\tau$. The analysis is done including tree and loop contributions
involving exchange of $W, Z$, charge and neutral higgs and leptons and mirror
leptons, charginos and neutralinos and sleptons and mirror sleptons. It is
found that a substantial branching ratio of $H^0_1\to \mu\tau$, i.e., of as
much a ${\cal{O}}(1)\%$, can be achieved in this model, the size hinted by the
ATLAS and CMS data. The flavor violating decays $H^0_1\to e\mu, e\tau$ are also
analyzed and found to be consistent with the current experimental limits. An
analysis of the dependence of flavor violating decays on CP phases is given.
The analysis is extended to include flavor decays of the heavier Higgs bosons.
A confirmation of the flavor violation in Higgs boson decays with more data
that is expected from LHC at $\sqrt s=13$ TeV will be evidence of new physics
beyond the standard model.

robots has recently received much attention. In particular, it has been shown
that convergence problems can even be solved for very weak, \emph{oblivious}
robots: robots which cannot maintain state from one round to the next. The
oblivious robot model is hence attractive from a self-stabilization
perspective, where state is subject to adversarial manipulation. However, to
the best of our knowledge, all existing robot convergence protocols rely on the
assumption that robots, despite being ""weak"", can measure distances.
  We in this paper initiate the study of convergence protocols for even simpler
robots, called \emph{monoculus robots}: robots which cannot measure distances.
In particular, we introduce two natural models which relax the assumptions on
the robots' cognitive capabilities: (1) a Locality Detection ($\mathcal{LD}$)
model in which a robot can only detect whether another robot is closer than a
given constant distance or not, (2) an Orthogonal Line Agreement
($\mathcal{OLA}$) model in which robots only agree on a pair of orthogonal
lines (say North-South and West-East, but without knowing which is which).
  The problem turns out to be non-trivial, and simple median and angle
bisection strategies can easily increase the distances among robots (e.g., the
area of the enclosing convex hull) over time. Our main contribution are
deterministic self-stabilizing convergence algorithms for these two models,
together with a complexity analysis. We also show that in some sense, the
assumptions made in our models are minimal: by relaxing the assumptions on the
\textit{monoculus robots} further, we run into impossibility results.

easily translated to frequency-selective channels, since space-time information
is required for transceiver design. In this paper, we demonstrate that BD is
feasible in frequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels to eliminate inter-user
interference (IUI) if the transmit block length is sufficiently large, and if
the number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of users. We also
propose three different approaches to mitigate/eliminate inter-symbol
interference (ISI) in block transmissions: i) time-reversal-based BD (TRBD)
which maximizes spatial focusing around the receivers using transmitter
processing only, ii) equalized BD (EBD) which minimizes the ISI using
transmitter processing only, and iii) joint processing BD (JPBD), which uses
linear processing at the transmitter and the receiver to suppress ISI. We
analyze the theoretical diversity and multiplexing gains of these techniques,
and we demonstrate that JPBD approximates full multiplexing gain for a
sufficiently large transmit block length. Extensive numerical simulations show
that the achievable rate and probability of error performance of all the
proposed methods improve those of conventional time-reversal beamforming.
Moreover, JPBD provides the highest achievable rate region for
frequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels.

extensible and software that is correct. Specifically, dynamic languages permit
software that is richly extensible (via dynamic code loading, dynamic object
extension, and various forms of reflection), and today's programmers exploit
this flexibility to ""bring their own language features"" to enrich extensible
languages (e.g., by using common JavaScript libraries). Meanwhile, such
library-based language extensions generally lack enforcement of their
abstractions, leading to programming errors that are complex to avoid and
predict.
  To offer verification for this extensible world, we propose online
verification-validation (OVV), which consists of language and VM design that
enables a ""phaseless"" approach to program analysis, in contrast to the standard
static-dynamic phase distinction. Phaseless analysis freely interposes abstract
interpretation with concrete execution, allowing analyses to use dynamic
(concrete) information to prove universal (abstract) properties about future
execution.
  In this paper, we present a conceptual overview of OVV through a motivating
example program that uses a hypothetical database library. We present a generic
semantics for OVV, and an extension to this semantics that offers a simple
gradual type system for the database library primitives. The result of
instantiating this gradual type system in an OVV setting is a checker that can
progressively type successive continuations of the program until a continuation
is fully verified. To evaluate the proposed vision of OVV for this example, we
implement the VM semantics (in Rust), and show that this design permits
progressive typing in this manner.

in the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple half spaces. One way to
tighten the region bound is using more half spaces, which however, adds to the
overhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lasso
screening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimization
problem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned by
the normals of the half spaces. This property converts an optimization problem
in high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing the

since the first discovery. However, some fundamental physics behind the
brilliant emission remains highly controversial. One of the important facts in
addressing the flare energetics is the spatialtemporal correlation between the
white-light emission and the hard X-ray radiation, presumably suggesting that
the energetic electrons are the energy sources. In this study, we present a
statistical analysis of 25 strong flares (?greater than or equal to M5)
observed simultaneously by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board

SDO/HMI in 13 flares, associated with HXR emission. To quantitatively describe
the strength of WL emission, equivalent area (EA) is defined as the integrated
contrast enhancement over the entire flaring area. Our results show that the
equivalent area is inversely proportional to the HXR power index, indicating
that stronger WL emission tends to be associated with larger population of high
energy electrons. However, no obvious correlation is found between WL emission
and flux of non-thermal electrons at 50 keV. For the other group of 13 flares
without detectable WL emission, the HXR spectra are softer (larger power index)

images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models
before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on
mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract
features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted.
However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation
between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each
domain. We suggest that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can
improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by
work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image
representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is
private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is
trained not only to perform the task we care about in the source domain, but
also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both
domains. Our novel architecture results in a model that outperforms the
state-of-the-art on a range of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and
additionally produces visualizations of the private and shared representations
enabling interpretation of the domain adaptation process.

formulate the maximizing EE problem under the outage probability constraints.
Relay scheduling (RS) and power allocation (PA) are applied to schedule the
relay states (transmitting, sleeping, \emph{etc}) and optimize the transmitting
power under the practical channel and power consumption models. Since the
optimization problem is NP-hard, to reduce computational complexity, the outage
probability is first tightly approximated to a log-convex form. Further, the EE
is converted into a subtractive form based on the fractional programming. Then
a convex mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) is eventually obtained. With a
generalized outer approximation (GOA) algorithm, RS and PA are solved in an
iterative manner. The Pareto-optimal curves between the EE and the target
outage probability show the EE gains from PA and RS. Moreover, by comparing
with the no network coding (NoNC) scenario, we conclude that with the same
number of relays, MDNC can lead to EE gains. However, if RS is implemented,
NoNC can outperform MDNC in terms of the EE when more relays are needed in the
MDNC scheme.

$n$ stochastic bandit arms, each associated with a reward distribution with an
unknown mean. We would like to identify the arm with the largest mean with
probability at least $1-\delta$, using as few samples as possible.
Understanding the sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm has attracted significant
attention since the last decade. However, the exact sample complexity of the
problem is still unknown.
  Recently, Chen and Li made the gap-entropy conjecture concerning the instance
sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm. Given an instance $I$, let $\mu_{[i]}$ be
the $i$th largest mean and $\Delta_{[i]}=\mu_{[1]}-\mu_{[i]}$ be the
corresponding gap. $H(I)=\sum_{i=2}^n\Delta_{[i]}^{-2}$ is the complexity of
the instance. The gap-entropy conjecture states that
$\Omega\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)\right)$ is an
instance lower bound, where $\mathsf{Ent}(I)$ is an entropy-like term
determined by the gaps, and there is a $\delta$-correct algorithm for
Best-$1$-Arm with sample complexity
$O\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)+\Delta_{[2]}^{-2}\ln\ln\Delta_{[2]}^{-1}\right)$.
If the conjecture is true, we would have a complete understanding of the
instance-wise sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm.
  We make significant progress towards the resolution of the gap-entropy
conjecture. For the upper bound, we provide a highly nontrivial algorithm which
requires \[O\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}
+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)+\Delta_{[2]}^{-2}\ln\ln\Delta_{[2]}^{-1}\mathrm{polylog}(n,\delta^{-1})\right)\]
samples in expectation. For the lower bound, we show that for any Gaussian
Best-$1$-Arm instance with gaps of the form $2^{-k}$, any $\delta$-correct
monotone algorithm requires $\Omega\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1} +
\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)\right)$ samples in expectation.

homology that allows one not only to compute persistence diagrams with less
noise and using less memory, but also to use persistence in new fields of
application. However, due to the increase in complexity of the algebraic
treatment of the theory, most algorithmic results in the field have remained of
theoretical nature.
  This article describes an efficient algorithm to compute zigzag persistence,
emphasising on its practical interest. The algorithm is a zigzag persistent
cohomology algorithm, based on the dualisation of reflections and
transpositions transformations within the zigzag sequence.
  We provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm. We study the
algorithm along two directions. First, we compare its performance with zigzag
persistent homology algorithm and show the interest of cohomology in zigzag
persistence. Second, we illustrate the interest of zigzag persistence in
topological data analysis by comparing it to state of the art methods in the
field, specifically optimised algorithm for standard persistent homology and
sparse filtrations. We compare the memory and time complexities of the
different algorithms, as well as the quality of the output persistence
diagrams.

However, the storage and computation of all accurate PPR vectors can be
prohibitive for large graphs, especially in caching them in memory for
real-time online querying. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework
that strikes a better balance between offline indexing and online querying. The
offline indexing attains a fingerprint of the PPR vector of each vertex by
performing billions of ""short"" random walks in parallel across a cluster of
machines. We prove that our indexing method has an exponential convergence,
achieving the same precision with previous methods using a much smaller number
of random walks. At query time, the new PPR vector is composed by a linear
combination of related fingerprints, in a highly efficient vertex-centric
decomposition manner. Interestingly, the resulting PPR vector is much more
accurate than its offline counterpart because it actually uses more random
walks in its estimation. More importantly, we show that such decomposition for
a batch of queries can be very efficiently processed using a shared
decomposition. Our implementation, PowerWalk, takes advantage of advanced
distributed graph engines and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by
orders of magnitude. Particularly, it responses to tens of thousands of queries

mechanism have long been major challenges of materials research in condensed

unprecedented possibilities for designing novel functionalities. Above all,
thin films of cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit
remarkably better superconducting characteristics (e.g. higher critical
temperatures) than in the bulk, but the underlying mechanism is still not
understood. Solving microscopic models suitable for cuprates, here, we
demonstrate that at an interface between a Mott insulator and an overdoped
non-superconducting metal, the superconducting amplitude stays always pinned at
the optimum achieved in the bulk, independently of the carrier concentration in
the metal. This is in contrast to the dome-like dependence in bulk
superconductors, but consistent with the astonishing independence of the
critical temperature from the carrier density x observed at interfaces of
La2CuO4 and La2-xSrxCuO4. We furthermore identify a self-organization mechanism
as responsible for the pinning at the optimum amplitude: An emergent electronic
structure induced by interlayer phase separation eludes bulk phase separation
and inhomogeneities that would kill superconductivity in the bulk. Thus,
interfaces provide an ideal tool to enhance and stabilize superconductivity.
This interfacial example opens up further ways of shaping superconductivity by
suppressing competing instabilities, with direct perspectives for designing
devices.

for continuity equations is chosen from the family of discontinuous Galerkin
methods. The accuracy tests and comparisons show that all of these four
strategies are suitable and competitive in streamer simulations from the
aspects of accuracy and efficiency. Results show these methods are compatible.
By applying any strategy in real simulations, we can study the dynamics of
streamer propagations in both 1D and quasi 2D models.

random wireless networks, the topology of which is modeled by stochastic
geometry. The setting is that of the Poisson bipolar model introduced in [1],
which is a natural model for ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks. The
primary finding is that, with knowledge of channel state information between a
receiver and its associated transmitter, by zero-forcing successive
interference cancellation, and for appropriate antenna configurations, the
ergodic spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly with both 1) the
minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas, 2) the density of nodes
and 3) the path-loss exponent. This linear gain is achieved by using the
transmit antennas to send multiple data streams (e.g. through an open-loop
transmission method) and by exploiting the receive antennas to cancel
interference. Furthermore, when a receiver is able to learn channel state
information from a certain number of near interferers, higher scaling gains can
be achieved when using a successive interference cancellation method. A major
implication of the derived scaling laws is that spatial multiplexing
transmission methods are essential for obtaining better and eventually optimal
scaling laws in multiple antenna random wireless networks. Simulation results
support this analysis.

interaction $\textit{U}$ can open the band gap without spin-orbit coupling
(SOC). However, the SOC should also be incorporated to reproduce the proper gap
size, indicating that the interplay between $\textit{U}$ and SOC plays an
essential role in the physics of $\alpha$-$\textrm{RuCl}_3$. There exist some

overfitting. Mathematically, this requires that the learning algorithm enjoys a
small generalization risk, which is defined either in expectation or in
probability. Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature.
For instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze
algorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in
probability is used in the VC theory, among others. Recently, a third notion of
generalization has been studied, called uniform generalization, which requires
that the generalization risk vanishes uniformly in expectation across all
bounded parametric losses. It has been shown that uniform generalization is, in
fact, equivalent to an information-theoretic stability constraint, and that it
recovers classical results in learning theory. It is achievable under various
settings, such as sample compression schemes, finite hypothesis spaces, finite
domains, and differential privacy. However, the relationship between uniform
generalization and concentration remained unknown. In this paper, we answer
this question by proving that, while a generalization in expectation does not
imply a generalization in probability, a uniform generalization in expectation
does imply concentration. We establish a chain rule for the uniform
generalization risk of the composition of hypotheses and use it to derive a
large deviation bound. Finally, we prove that the bound is tight.

From the measured meson momentum distributions the momentum dependence of the

analysis the in-medium $\omega$ and $\eta^\prime$ widths and the corresponding
absorption cross sections have been deduced as a function of the meson
momentum. The results are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the
in-medium $\omega$ width and $\eta^\prime$-N absorption cross sections. The
energy dependence of the imaginary part of the $\omega$- and
$\eta^\prime$-nucleus optical potential has been extracted. The finer binning
of the present data compared to the existing data allows a more reliable
extrapolation towards the production threshold. The modulus of the imaginary
part of the $\eta^\prime$ nucleus potential is found to be about three times
smaller than recently determined values of the real part of the
$\eta^\prime$-nucleus potential, which makes the $\eta^\prime$ meson a suitable
candidate for the search for meson-nucleus bound states. For the $\omega$
meson, the modulus of the imaginary part near threshold is comparable to the
modulus of the real part of the potential. As a consequence, only broad
structures can be expected which makes the observation of $\omega$ mesic states
very difficult experimentally.

implementations were focused on minimizing the average cost. We show that the
tuning of the algorithm is not the same to reduce the maximal number of
iterations as for reducing the average cost. This provides some indications on
how to engineer the QC-MDPC-McEliece scheme to resist a timing side-channel
attack.

the expected absorbance of the spiral structure and the timing jitter per unit

Many planets are however expected to be only transiently habitable. On a large
set of otherwise suitable planets life will therefore just not have the time to
develop on its own to a complexity level as it did arise on earth with the
cambrian explosion. The equivalent of a cambrian explosion may however have the
chance to unfold on transiently habitable planets if it would be possible to
fast forward evolution by 3-4 billion years (with respect to terrestrial
timescales). We argue here, that this is indeed possible when seeding the

simple problems such as an oscillating piston and the oscillation in an

close to equilibrium in the linear limit and one does not require far-from

conclude that the method can be used as an indicator of the ages, and therefore
initial masses, of SN progenitors. We find that the spatial distributions of

Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), have provided us
with a clue to the dust properties in the nearby Universe. We examine whether
or not these extinction curves can be explained by well known dust evolution
processes. We treat the dust production in stellar ejecta, destruction in
supernova shocks, dust growth by accretion and coagulation, and dust disruption
by shattering. To make a survey of the large parameter space possible, we
simplify the treatment of the grain size distribution evolution by adopting the
`two-size approximation', in which we divide the grain population into small
($\lesssim 0.03~\mu$m) and large ($\gtrsim 0.03~\mu$m) grains. It is confirmed
that the MW extinction curve can be reproduced in reasonable ranges for the
time-scale of the above processes with a silicate-graphite mixture. This
indicates that the MW extinction curve is a natural consequence of the dust
evolution through the above processes. We also find that the same models fail
to reproduce the SMC/LMC extinction curves. Nevertheless, this failure can be
remedied by giving higher supernova destruction rates for small carbonaceous
dust and considering amorphous carbon for carbonaceous dust; these modification
fall in fact in line with previous studies. Therefore, we conclude that the
current dust evolution scenario composed of the aforementioned processes is
successful in explaining the extinction curves. All the extinction curves favor
efficient interstellar processing of dust, especially, strong grain growth by
accretion and coagulation.

by a dynamical Gaussian-broadened Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function indicating
strong fluctuations of the ordered state. The spectra of the paramagnetic state
(below 4.2~K) reveal anomalously slow paramagnetic spin dynamics and show only
small difference with the spectra of the ordered state. We find that the
fluctuation rate decreases with decreasing temperature and becomes nearly
temperature independent below the transition temperature indicating persistent
slow spin dynamics in the ground state. The field distribution width shows a
small but sudden increase at the transition temperature and then becomes almost
constant. The spectra in applied longitudinal fields are well fitted by the
conventional dynamical Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function, which further supports
the dynamical nature of the ground state. The fluctuation rate shows a peak as
a function of external field which is associated with a field-induced spin-flip

consider errors occurring at runtime. Both hardware- and software-based error
handling must be deployed to meet application reliability requirements. The
level of required reliability can vary for system components and depend on
input and state, so that a selective use of resilience methods is advised,
especially for resource-constrained platforms as found in embedded systems. If
an error occurring at runtime can be classified as having negligible or
tolerable impact, less effort can be spent on correcting it. As the actual
impact of an error is often dependent on the state of a system at time of
occurrence, it can not be determined precisely for highly dynamic workloads in
data-driven applications. We present a concept to estimate error propagation in
sets of tasks with variable data dependencies. This allows for a coarse grained
analysis of the impact a failed task may have on the overall output. As an
application example, we demonstrate our method for a typical dynamic embedded
application, namely a decoder for the H.264 video format.

to lines with column density down to $\log N_{\rm CIV} \simeq 11.4$ and in 60

associated CIV absorption. At $\log N_{\rm HI} < 14.0$, the detection rates
drop to $<10$ per cent, possibly due to our sensitivity limits and not to an
actual variation of the gas abundance properties. In the range $\log N_{\rm HI}

larger than the fraction of HI lines lying in the circum-galactic medium (CGM)

spectral and timing variability, including the detection of flares,
quasi-periodic oscillations, complex changes in the pulse profiles, and pulse
phase dependent spectral variability. We re-analysed the data covering the 2003
X-ray outburst and focused on several aspects of the variability that have not
been discussed so far. These are the 10 keV feature and the X-ray spectral
states and their association with accretion regimes, including the transit to
the propeller state at the end of the outburst. We find that 4U 1901+03 went
through three accretion regimes over the course of the X-ray outburst. At the
peak of the outburst and for a very short time, the X-ray flux may have
overcome the critical limit that marks the formation of a radiative shock at a
certain distance above the neutron star surface. Most of the time, however, the
source is in the subcritical regime. Only at the end of the outburst, when the
luminosity decreased below ~10^{36} (d/10 kpc)^2 erg/s, did the source enter
the propeller regime. Evidence for the existence of these regimes comes from
the pulse profiles, the shape of the hardness-intensity diagram, and the
correlation of various spectral parameters with the flux. The 10 keV feature
appears to strongly depend on the X-ray flux and on the pulse phase, which
opens the possibility to interpret this feature as a cyclotron line.

maps of the NGC 1333 star-forming region to assess the relative influence of
atomic jets onto the star-formation process. Atomic line maps are compared
against molecular outflow tracers and atomic ejecta are associated to
individual driving sources. We study the detailed morphology and velocity
distribution of [OI] line using channel and line-centroid maps and derive the
momentum, energy, and mass flux for all the bipolar jets traced by [OI] line
emission. We find that the line-centroid maps can trace velocity structures
down to 5 km s$^{-1}$ which is a factor of $\sim$20 beyond the nominal velocity
resolution reached by Herschel/PACS. These maps reveal an unprecedented degree
of details that assist significantly in the association and characterization of
jets and outflows. Comparisons of the dynamical and kinematical properties
shows that [OI] momentum accounts for only $\sim$1% of the momentum carried by
the large scale CO outflows but the energy released through the jets
corresponds to 50 - 100% of the energy released in outflows. The estimated
ratios of the jet to the outflow momenta and energies are consistent with the
results of two-component, nested jet/outflow simulations, where jets are
associated to episodic accretion events. Under this scenario, the energy from
atomic jets to the cloud is as important as the energy output from outflows in
maintaining turbulence and dissipating the cloud gas.

also the parameters of each neuron. Existing works mainly concentrate on either
the synaptic weights or the neural parameters. In this paper we present an
algorithm to reconstruct all parameters including the synaptic weights of a
spiking neuron model. The model based on works of Eugene M. Izhikevich
(Izhikevich 2007) consists of two differential equations and covers different
types of cortical neurons. It combines the dynamical properties of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with a high computational efficiency. The
presented algorithm uses the recordings of the corresponding membrane
potentials of the model for the reconstruction and consists of two main
components. The first component is a rank based Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is
used to find the neural parameters of the model. The second one is a Least Mean
Squares approach which computes the synaptic weights of all interconnected
neurons by minimizing the squared error between the calculated and the measured
membrane potentials for each time step. In preparation for the reconstruction
of the neural parameters and of the synaptic weights from real measured
membrane potentials, promising results based on simulated data generated with a
randomly parametrized Izhikevich model are presented. The reconstruction does
not only converge to a global minimum of neural parameters, but also
approximates the synaptic weights with high precision.

Unlike conventional approaches to duration modelling -- which assume that

mean of that distribution for synthesis -- our approach can in principle model
any distribution supported on the non-negative integers. Generation from this
model can be performed in many ways; here we consider output generation based
on the median predicted duration. The median is more typical (more probable)
than the conventional mean duration, is robust to training-data irregularities,
and enables incremental generation. Furthermore, a frame-level approach to
duration prediction is consistent with a longer-term goal of modelling
durations and acoustic features together. Results indicate that the proposed
method is competitive with baseline approaches in approximating the median

  Single-Photon Data Acquired in Underwater Environments",,,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents two new algorithms for the joint restoration of depth and
reflectivity (DR) images constructed from time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) measurements. Two extreme cases are considered: (i) a reduced
acquisition time that leads to very low photon counts and (ii) a highly
attenuating environment (such as a turbid medium) which makes the reflectivity
estimation more difficult at increasing range. Adopting a Bayesian approach,
the Poisson distributed observations are combined with prior distributions
about the parameters of interest, to build the joint posterior distribution.
More precisely, two Markov random field (MRF) priors enforcing spatial
correlations are assigned to the DR images. Under some justified assumptions,
the restoration problem (regularized likelihood) reduces to a convex
formulation with respect to each of the parameters of interest. This problem is
first solved using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that
approximates the minimum mean square parameter estimators. This algorithm is
fully automatic since it adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal
likelihood estimation. However, the MCMC-based algorithm exhibits a relatively
long computational time. The second algorithm deals with this issue and is
based on a coordinate descent algorithm. Results on single-photon depth data
from laboratory based underwater measurements demonstrate the benefit of the
proposed strategy that improves the quality of the estimated DR images.

intestinal epithelium adopt a secretory or an absorptive phenotype. Cell fate
specification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt
pathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt
pathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk.
Computational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy
intestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of
biochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction
network theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the
capacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing
properties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific
parameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the
role of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations,
demonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce
dynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to
monostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the
stabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and
Dsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular
dynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes1 dominates, there is Notch
oscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of
Hes1 favours bistability akin to cell fate selection. Cells could therefore
regulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes1 promoter
to coordinate the timing of cell fate selection as they migrate through the
intestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli.

provide an interesting alternative to characterise the infall histories of
protostars. Previous observations of H13CO+ towards the low-mass protostar
IRAS15398-3359 showed a depression in the abundance. This is a sign of
destruction of HCO+ by an enhanced presence of gaseous water in an extended
region, possibly related to a recent burst in the accretion. Direct
observations of water vapour can determine the exact extent of the emission and
confirm the hypothesis that HCO+ is indeed a good tracer of the water
snow-line. IRAS15398 was observed using ALMA at 0.5"" resolution. Maps of
HDO(101-000) and H218O(414-321) were taken simultaneously with observations of
the CS(8-7) and N2H+(5-4) lines and continuum at 0.65 and 0.75 mm. The maps
were interpreted using dust radiative transfer calculations of the protostellar
infalling envelope with an outflow cavity. HDO is clearly detected and extended
over the scales of the H13CO+ depression, although it is displaced by ~500 AU
in the direction of the outflow. H218O is tentatively detected towards the
red-shifted outflow lobe, but otherwise it is absent from the mapped region,
which suggests that temperatures are low. Based on the temperature structure
obtained from dust radiative transfer models, we conclude that the water was
most likely released from the grains in an extended hour-glass configuration
during a recent accretion burst. HDO is only detected in the region closest to
the protostar, at distances of up to 500 AU. These signatures can only be
explained if the luminosity has recently been increased by orders of
magnitudes. Additionally, the densities in the outflow cones must be
sufficiently low.

nonconvex, the overarching optimization scheme arrives at geologically
plausible results by solving a sequence of relaxed and warm-started constrained
convex subproblems. The combination of box, total-variation, and successively
relaxed asymmetric total-variation constraints allows us to steer free from
parasitic local minima while keeping the estimated physical parameters
laterally continuous and in a physically realistic range. For accurate starting
models, numerical experiments carried out on the challenging 2004 BP velocity
benchmark demonstrate that bound and total-variation constraints improve the
inversion result significantly by removing inversion artifacts, related to
source encoding, and by clearly improved delineation of top, bottom, and flanks
of a high-velocity high-contrast salt inclusion. The experiments also show that
for poor starting models these two constraints by themselves are insufficient
to detect the bottom of high-velocity inclusions such as salt. Inclusion of the
one-sided asymmetric total-variation constraint overcomes this issue by
discouraging velocity lows to buildup during the early stages of the inversion.
To the author's knowledge the presented algorithm is the first to successfully
remove the imprint of local minima caused by poor starting models and
band-width limited finite aperture data.

The first is that IR divergences get sharper as the acceleration slows. The
second is that UV-divergent contact terms in the Euclidean computation can
contribute to the absolute value of the wavefunction in Lorentzian signature.

enforcing application semantics. However, formulating constraints manually
requires domain expertise, is prone to human errors, and may be excessively
time consuming, especially on large datasets. Hence, proposals for automatic
discovery have been made for some classes of ICs, such as functional
dependencies (FDs), and recently, order dependencies (ODs). ODs properly
subsume FDs, as they can additionally express business rules involving order;
e.g., an employee never has a higher salary while paying lower taxes compared
with another employee.
  We address the limitations of prior work on OD discovery which has factorial
complexity in the number of attributes, is incomplete (i.e., it does not
discover valid ODs that cannot be inferred from the ones found) and is not
concise (i.e., it can result in ""redundant"" discovery and overly large
discovery sets). We improve significantly on complexity, offer completeness,
and define a compact canonical form. This is based on a novel polynomial
mapping to a canonical form for ODs, and a sound and complete set of axioms
(inference rules) for canonical ODs. This allows us to develop an efficient
set-containment, lattice-driven OD discovery algorithm that uses the inference
rules to prune the search space. Our algorithm has exponential worst-case time
complexity in the number of attributes and linear complexity in the number of
tuples. We prove that it produces a complete, minimal set of ODs (i.e., minimal
with regards to the canonical representation). Finally, using real and
synthetic datasets, we experimentally show orders-of-magnitude performance
improvements over the current state-of-the-art algorithm and demonstrate

take advantage of the high number of cores available in microprocessors. This
can be achieved by manually specifying which code executes on which thread, by
using compiler parallelization hints (such as OpenMP or Cilk), or by using a
parallel programming language (such as X10, Chapel or Aeminium. Regardless of
the approach, all of these programs are compiled to an intermediate lower-level
language that is sequential, thus preventing the backend compiler from
optimizing the program and observing its parallel nature. This paper presents
MISO, an intermediate language that expresses the parallel nature of programs
and that can be targeted by front-end compilers. The language defines 'cells',
which are composed by a state and a transition function from one state to the
next. This language can express both sequential and parallel programs, and
provides information for a backend- compiler to generate efficient parallel
programs. Moreover, MISO can be used to automatically add redundancy to a
program, by replicating the state or by taking advantage of different processor
cores, in order to provide fault tolerance for programs running on unreliable
hardware.

by strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Owing to the close
distance to Orion (about 1,350 light-year), the effects of stellar feedback on
the parental cloud can be studied in detail. Visible-light observations of the
Bar(1) show that the transition between the hot ionised gas and the warm
neutral atomic gas (the ionisation front) is spatially well separated from the
transition from atomic to molecular gas (the dissociation front): about 15
arcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun
distance). Static equilibrium models(2,3) used to interpret previous
far-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Bar(4,5,6)
(typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud
structure consisting of dense clumps embedded in a lower density extended gas
component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that
allow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary
model predictions(7,8,9), there is no appreciable offset between the peak of
the H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of
the observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO
transition zones are very close. These observations reveal a fragmented ridge
of high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the
molecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been
compressed by a high-pressure wave that currently moves into the molecular
cloud. The images demonstrate that dynamical and nonequilibrium effects are
important for the cloud evolution.

  Copulas with Discrete and Mixed Margins","63 pages and 25 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating copulas with discrete marginal distributions is challenging,
especially in high dimensions, because computing the likelihood contribution of
each observation requires evaluating $2^{J}$ terms, with $J$ the number of
discrete variables. Currently, data augmentation methods are used to carry out
inference for discrete copula and, in practice, the computation becomes
infeasible when $J$ is large. Our article proposes two new fast Bayesian
approaches for estimating high dimensional copulas with discrete margins, or a
combination of discrete and continuous margins. Both methods are based on
recent advances in Bayesian methodology that work with an unbiased estimate of
the likelihood rather than the likelihood itself, and our key observation is
that we can estimate the likelihood of a discrete copula unbiasedly with much
less computation than evaluating the likelihood exactly or with current
simulation methods that are based on augmenting the model with latent
variables. The first approach builds on the pseudo marginal method that allows
Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation from the posterior distribution using only
an unbiased estimate of the likelihood. The second approach is based on a
Variational Bayes approximation to the posterior and also uses an unbiased
estimate of the likelihood. We show that Monte Carlo and randomised quasi Monte
Carlo methods can be used with both approaches to reduce the variability of the
estimate of the likelihood, and hence enable us to carry out Bayesian inference
for high values of $J$ for some classes of copulas where the computation was
previously too expensive. Our article also introduces {\em a correlated quasi
random number pseudo marginal} approach into the literature. The methodology is
illustrated through several real and simulated data examples.

considered theoretically, with a particular focus on the role of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) and thermomagnonic torques. The
thermally assisted DW motion is a consequence of the magnonic spin current due
to the applied thermal bias. In addition to the exchange magnonic spin current
and the exchange adiabatic and the entropic spin transfer torques, we also
consider the DMI-induced magnonic spin current, thermomagnonic DMI field-like
torque and the DMI entropic torque. Analytical estimations are supported by
numerical calculations. We found that the DMI has a substantial influence on
the size and the geometry of DWs, and that the DWs become oriented parallel to
the long axis of the nanostrip. Increasing the temperature smoothes the DWs.
Moreover, the thermallyinduced magnonic current generates a torque on the DWs,
which is responsible for their motion. From our analysis it follows that for a
large enough DMI the influence of DMI-induced field-like torque is much
stronger than that of the DMI and the exchange entropic torques. By
manipulating the strength of the DMI constant, one can control the speed of the
DW motion, and the direction of the DW motion can be switched, as well. We also
found that DMI not only contributes to the total magnonic current, but also it
modifies the exchange magnonic spin current, and this modification depends on
the orientation of the steady state magnetization. The observed phenomenon can
be utilized in spin caloritronics devices, for example in the DMI based thermal
diodes. By switching the magnetization direction, one can rectify the total
magnonic spin current.

pressure and density of supranuclear matter: the equation of state. Some of
this uncertainty may be removed through future gravitational wave observations
of neutron star binaries by extracting the tidal deformabilities (or Love
numbers) of neutron stars. Previous studies showed that only a certain
combination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal
deformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave
interferometers, such as Adv. LIGO, due to correlations between the individual
deformabilities. To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or
equation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the
individual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,
the other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled
through these relations. We find an approximately universal relation between
the symmetric and the anti-symmetric combination of the individual tidal
deformabilities that is equation-of-state-insensitive to $20\%$ for binaries
with masses less than $1.7M_\odot$. We show that these relations can be used to
eliminate a combination of the tidal parameters from the list of model
parameters, thus breaking degeneracies and improving the accuracy in parameter
estimation. A simple study shows that the universal relations can improve the
accuracy in the extraction of the symmetric combination of tidal parameters by
as much as an order of magnitude, making the overall accuracy in the extraction
of this parameter slightly better than that of the chirp tidal deformability.
These new universal relations and the improved measurement accuracy on tidal
parameters not only are important to astrophysics and nuclear physics, but also
impact our ability to probe extreme gravity with gravitational waves and
cosmology.

capturing individual particle contacts and hydrodynamic interactions. The
simulations reveal inhomogeneous velocity and stress distributions, originating
in the inherent microstructure formed by the constituent particles. Such
features are shown to be relevant to generic paste extrusion behaviour, such as
die swell. The pressure drop across the extruder is correlated with the
extrudate velocity using the Benbow-Bridgwater equation, with the empirical
parameters being linked directly to particle properties such as surface
friction, and processing conditions such as extruder wall roughness. Our model
and results bring recent advances in suspension rheology into an industrial
setting, laying foundations for future model development, paste formulation and

emerged as a popular framework for several computer vision applications such as
stereo correspondence and semantic segmentation. By modeling long-range
interactions, dense CRFs provide a more detailed labelling compared to their
sparse counterparts. Variational inference in these dense models is performed
using a filtering-based mean-field algorithm in order to obtain a
fully-factorized distribution minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the
true distribution. In contrast to the continuous relaxation-based energy
minimisation algorithms used for sparse CRFs, the mean-field algorithm fails to
provide strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of its solutions. To
address this deficiency, we show that it is possible to use the same filtering
approach to speed-up the optimisation of several continuous relaxations.
Specifically, we solve a convex quadratic programming (QP) relaxation using the
efficient Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This also allows us to solve
difference-of-convex relaxations via the iterative concave-convex procedure
where each iteration requires solving a convex QP. Finally, we develop a novel
divide-and-conquer method to compute the subgradients of a linear programming
relaxation that provides the best theoretical bounds for energy minimisation.
We demonstrate the advantage of continuous relaxations over the widely used
mean-field algorithm on publicly available datasets.

LBV, exhibits expanding, compressed wind shells, seen in emission, that are
spatially and spectrally resolved by \hst/\stis. Starting in June 2009, these
structures were mapped across its 5.54-year, highly elliptical, binary orbit to
follow temporal changes in the light of [Fe~III] 4659\AA\ and [Fe~II] 4815\AA.
The emissions trace portions of fossil wind-shells, that were formed by
wind-wind interactions across each cycle. Over the high-ionization state, dense
arcs, photo-ionized by far ultraviolet radiation from the hot secondary, are
seen in [Fe~III]. Other arcs, ionized by mid-ultraviolet radiation from the
primary star, are seen in [Fe II]. The [Fe III] structures tend to be interior
to [Fe II] structures that trace extensive, less disturbed primary wind. During
the brief periastron passage when the secondary plunges deep into the primary's
extremely dense wind, on the far side of primary star, high-ionization [Fe III]
structures fade and reappear in [Fe II]. Multiple fossil wind-structures were
traced across the 5.7-year monitoring interval. The strong similarity of the
expanding [Fe II] shells suggests that the wind and photo-ionization properties
of the massive binary have not changed substantially from one orbit to the next
over the past several orbital cycles. These observations trace structures that
can be used to test three-dimensional hydrodynamical and radiative-transfer
models of massive, interacting winds. They also provide a baseline for
following future changes in Eta Carinae, especially of its winds and
photoionization properties.

important to investigate mesoscale (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such
as dense sets of nodes known as communities, to discover network features that
are not apparent at the microscale or the macroscale. The ill-defined nature of
mesoscale structure and its ubiquity in empirical networks make it crucial to
develop generative models that can produce the features that one encounters in
empirical networks. Key purposes of such generative models include generating
synthetic networks with empirical properties of interest, benchmarking
mesoscale-detection methods and algorithms, and inferring structure in
empirical multilayer networks. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the
construction of generative models for mesoscale structures in multilayer

studies of mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. It unifies and
generalizes many existing models for mesoscale structures in fully-ordered

also use it to construct generative models for mesoscale structures in
partially-ordered multilayer networks (e.g., networks that are both temporal

local optima) landscapes is presented for a large and physically general class
of quantum system. This result offers an explanation for why gradient methods
succeed so frequently in quantum control in both theory and practice. The role
of singular controls is analyzed using geometric tools in the case of the
control of the propagator of closed finite dimension systems. This type of
control field has been implicated as a source of landscape traps. The
conditions under which singular controls can introduce traps, and thus
interrupt the progress of a control optimization, are discussed and a
geometrical characterization of the issue is presented. It is shown that a
control being singular is not sufficient to cause a control optimization
progress to halt and sufficient conditions for a trap free landscape are
presented. It is further shown that the local surjectivity axiom of landscape
analysis can be refined to the condition that the end-point map is transverse
to each of the level sets of the fidelity function. This novel condition is
shown to be sufficient for a quantum system's landscape to be trap free. The
control landscape for a quantum system is shown to be trap free for all but a
null set of Hamiltonians using a novel geometric technique based on the
parametric transversality theorem. Numerical evidence confirming this is also
presented. This result is the analogue of the work of Altifini, wherein it is
shown that controllability holds for all but a null set of quantum systems in
the dipole approximation. The presented results indicate that by-and-large
limited control resources are the most physically relevant source of landscape
traps.

interacting via competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction in
two dimensions. The particles are compressed using a time-dependent quasi-one
dimensional trough potential that controls the local density, causing the
system to undergo a series of structural phase transitions from a low density
clump lattice to stripes, voids, and a high density uniform state. The
compression proceeds via slow elastic motion that is interrupted with
avalanche-like bursts of activity as the system collapses to progressively
higher densities via plastic rearrangements. The plastic events vary in
magnitude from small rearrangements of particles, including the formation of
quadrupole-like defects, to large-scale vorticity and structural phase
transitions. In the dense uniform phase, the system compresses through row
reduction transitions mediated by a disorder-order process. We characterize the
rearrangement events by measuring changes in the potential energy, the fraction
of sixfold coordinated particles, the local density, and the velocity
distribution. At high confinements, we find power law scaling of the velocity
distribution during row reduction transitions. We observe hysteresis under a
reversal of the compression when relatively few plastic rearrangements occur.
The decompressing system exhibits distinct phase morphologies, and the phase
transitions occur at lower compression forces as the system expands compared to
when it is compressed.

overview of a platform is given for testing, evaluating and implementing
mechanisms to adapt Smart Meter data aggregation. Three main aspects of
adaptiveness of the system are studied, adaptiveness to smart metering
application needs, adaptiveness to changing communication network dynamics and
adaptiveness to security attacks. Execution of tests will be conducted in real
field experimental set-up and in an advanced hardware in the loop test-bed with
power and communication co-simulation for validation purposes.

Such solutions are constructed by its associated sequence of correlation
functions satisfying the so-called Ruelle-bound. Using the general scheme of
Vlasov scaling we are able to derive a system of non-linear, non-local
mesoscopic equations describing the effective density of the particle system.
The results are applied to several models of ecology and biology.

This is achieved by expressing the densities of stable and inverse stable

the properties of toric P-difference varieties. Toric P-difference varieties
are analogues of toric varieties in difference algebra geometry. The category
of affine toric P-difference varieties with toric morphisms is shown to be
antiequivalent to the category of affine P[x]-semimodules with P[x]-semimodule
morphisms. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
irreducible invariant P-difference subvarieties of an affine toric P-difference
variety and the faces of the corresponding affine P[x]-semimodule. We also
define abstract toric P-difference varieties associated with fans by gluing
affine toric P-difference varieties. The irreducible invariant P-difference
subvarieties-faces correspondence is generalized to abstract toric P-difference
varieties. By virtue of this correspondence, a divisor theory for abstract
toric P-difference varieties is developed.

in agreement with various theories of quantum gravity. In this scenario, the
original general relativity can be changed to the so-called gravity's rainbow
which produces significant modifications to the black holes' evolution. In this
paper, using two kinds of rainbow functions, we investigate the thermodynamics
and the phase transition of Schwarzschild black hole in the context of
gravity's rainbow theory. Firstly, with the help of the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, we calculate the modified Hawking temperature. Then, based on this
modification, we derive the local temperature, free energy and other
thermodynamic quantities in an isothermal cavity. Finally, the critical
behavior, the thermodynamic stability and phase transition of the rainbow
Schwarzschild black hole are analyzed. It turns out that our results are
different from the those of Hawking-Page phase transition. Meanwhile, it is
found that there are many similarities and differences between rainbow
functions I case and rainbow functions II.

complex with a cohomology for which topological quantities like Morse indices,
Betti numbers or counting functions for critical points of Morse index are
explicitly given in number theoretical terms. The Euler characteristic of the
Morse filtration is related to the Mertens function, the Poincar\'e-Hopf
indices at critical points correspond to the values of the Moebius function.
The Morse inequalities link number theoretical quantities like the prime
counting functions relevant for the distribution of primes with cohomological
properties of the graphs. The just given picture is a special case of a
discrete Morse cohomology equivalent to simplicial cohomology. The special
example considered here is a case where the graph is the Barycentric refinement
of a finite simple graph.

  arXiv:1606.05971",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Primes in the two complete associative normed division algebras C and H have
affinities with structures seen in the standard model of particle physics. On
the integers in the two algebras, there are two equivalence relations: a strong
one, related to a U(1) and SU(3) symmetry allowing to permute and switch signs
of the coordinates of the integers, as well as a weak relation with origins
from units U(1),SU(2) in the algebra. Weak equivalence classes within the
strong equivalence classes of odd primes in C case relate to leptons, the inert
ones being neutrino like, and the split ones resembling electron-positron
pairs. In the H case, for odd primes, the equivalence classes come in groups of
two or three, leading to a caricature of hadrons featuring either mesons built
by a quark pair or then baryons obtained by quark triplets. We can now list for
every rational prime p all these particles and attach fractional charges to its
constituents.
