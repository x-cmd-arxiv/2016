considered as pairwise. However, when the polymer chain is in collapsed state,
the dipole correlations have to be considered at the many-body level.

  We add to existing numerical approaches by deploying goal-oriented adaptive

error estimator uses the much cheaper Poisson-Boltzmann equation as a
simplified model, which is justified on heuristic grounds but shown to work
well in practice. To address the nonlinearity in the full PNP-Stokes system,
three different linearization schemes are proposed and investigated, with two
segregated iterative approaches both outperforming a naive application of
Newton's method. Numerical experiments are reported on a real-world nanopore

  We also investigate two different models for the interaction of target
molecules with the nanopore sensor through the PNP-Stokes equations. In one
model, the molecule is of finite size and is explicitly built into the
geometry; while in the other, the molecule is located at a single point and
only modeled implicitly -- after solution of the system -- which is
computationally favorable. We compare the resulting force profiles of the

field amplification and production of a bipolar outflow that can explode the

an evolved rapidly rotating massive star is followed in three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code with neutrino leakage. A rotating
proto-neutron star (PNS) forms with a non-zero linear velocity. This can
contribute to the natal kick of the remnant compact object. The PNS is
surrounded by a turbulent medium, where high shearing is likely to amplify
magnetic fields, which in turn can drive a bipolar outflow. Neutron-rich
material in the PNS vicinity might induce strong r-process nucleosynthesis. The
rapidly rotating PNS possesses a rotational energy of E>10foe. Magnetar
formation proceeding in a similar fashion will be able to deposit a portion of
this energy later on in the supernova ejecta through a spin down mechanism.
These processes can be important for rare supernovae generated by rapidly
rotating progenitors, even though a complete explosion is not simulated in the
present study.

embedded systems and replicated databases to cloud computing. Due to
asynchronous communication, process faults, or network failures, these
algorithms are difficult to design and verify. Many algorithms achieve fault
tolerance by using threshold guards that, for instance, ensure that a process
waits until it has received an acknowledgment from a majority of its peers.
Consequently, domain-specific languages for fault-tolerant distributed systems
offer language support for threshold guards.
  We introduce an automated method for model checking of safety and liveness of
threshold-guarded distributed algorithms in systems where the number of
processes and the fraction of faulty processes are parameters. Our method is
based on a short counterexample property: if a distributed algorithm violates a
temporal specification (in a fragment of LTL), then there is a counterexample
whose length is bounded and independent of the parameters. We prove this
property by (i) characterizing executions depending on the structure of the
temporal formula, and (ii) using commutativity of transitions to accelerate and
shorten executions. We extended the ByMC toolset (Byzantine Model Checker) with
our technique, and verified liveness and safety of 10 prominent fault-tolerant
distributed algorithms, most of which were out of reach for existing
techniques.

Tycho's SNR. We derived the basic properties (column density, mass, and
kinematics) of these objects based on the CO observations. The large molecular
clouds individually show an arc toward the remnant center, outlining a large
cavity with radii of $\sim$0.3$^\circ$$\times$0.6$^\circ$ (or 13 pc $\times$27
pc at a distance of 2.5 kpc) around the remnant. The CO line broadenings and
asymmetries detected in the surrounding clouds, the observed expansion of the
cavity, in concert with enhanced $^{12}$CO(2-1)/(1-0) intensity ratio detected
in previous studies, suggest the interaction of the large cavity with a wind in
the region. After excluding the scenario of a large bubble produced by bright
massive stars, we suggest that the large cavity could be explained by accretion
wind from the progenitor system of Tycho's supernova. Nevertheless, the
possibility of the random distribution of a large cavity around Tycho's SNR
cannot be ruled out thus far. Further observations are needed to confirm the
physical association of the large cavity with Tycho's SNR.

photos. To make photos more visually appealing, users usually apply filters on
their photos without domain knowledge. However, due to the growing number of
filter types, it becomes a major issue for users to choose the best filter
type. For this purpose, filter recommendation for photo aesthetics takes an
important role in image quality ranking problems. In these years, several works
have declared that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) outperform traditional
methods in image aesthetic categorization, which classifies images into high or
low quality. Most of them do not consider the effect on filtered images; hence,
we propose a novel image aesthetic learning for filter recommendation. Instead
of binarizing image quality, we adjust the state-of-the-art CNN architectures
and design a pairwise loss function to learn the embedded aesthetic responses
in hidden layers for filtered images. Based on our pilot study, we observe
image categories (e.g., portrait, landscape, food) will affect user preference
on filter selection. We further integrate category classification into our
proposed aesthetic-oriented models. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
public dataset for aesthetic judgment with filtered images. We create a new
dataset called Filter Aesthetic Comparison Dataset (FACD). It contains 28,160
filtered images based on the AVA dataset and 42,240 reliable image pairs with
aesthetic annotations using Amazon Mechanical Turk. It is the first dataset
containing filtered images and user preference labels. We conduct experiments
on the collected FACD for filter recommendation, and the results show that our
proposed category-aware aesthetic learning outperforms aesthetic classification
methods (e.g., 12% relative improvement).

using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error
gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and

explore an novel problem of searching for top-k diversified similar nodes in
attributed networks, with the motivation that modeling diversification in an
attributed network should consider both the emergence of network links and the
attribute features of nodes such as user profile information. We formulate this
practical problem as two optimization problems: the Attributed Coverage
Diversification (ACD) problem and the r-Dissimilar Attributed Coverage
Diversification (r-DACD) problem. Based on the submodularity and the
monotonicity of ACD, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm achieving a tight
approximation guarantee of 1-1/e. Unlike the expension based methods only
considering nodes' neighborhood, ACD generalize the definition of
diversification to nodes' own features. To capture diversification in
topological structure of networks, the r-DACD problem introduce a dissimilarity
constraint. We refer to this problem as the Dissimilarity Constrained
Non-monotone Submodular Maximization (DCNSM) problem. We prove that there is no
constant-factor approximation for DCNSM, and also present an efficient greedy
algorithms achieving $1/\rho$ approximation, where $\rho\le\Delta$, $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of its dissimilarity based graph. To the best of our

Maximization problem with a distance constraint. The experimental results on

exists an assignment to a set of variables which satisfies specified
constraints between pairs of variables. A binary CSP instance can be presented
as a labelled graph encoding both the forms of the constraints and where they
are imposed. We consider subproblems defined by restricting the allowed form of
this graph. One type of restriction that has previously been considered is to
forbid certain specified substructures (patterns). This captures some tractable
classes of the CSP, but does not capture classes defined by language
restrictions, or the well-known structural property of acyclicity.
  In this paper we extend the notion of pattern and introduce the notion of a
topological minor of a binary CSP instance. By forbidding a finite set of
patterns from occurring as topological minors we obtain a compact mechanism for
expressing novel tractable subproblems of the binary CSP, including new
generalisations of the class of acyclic instances. Forbidding a finite set of
patterns as topological minors also captures all other tractable structural
restrictions of the binary CSP. Moreover, we show that several patterns give
rise to tractable subproblems if forbidden as topological minors but not if
forbidden as sub-patterns. Finally, we introduce the idea of augmented patterns
that allows for the identification of more tractable classes, including all
language restrictions of the binary CSP.

Goldreich and Sridhar, at the same time the Kolmogorov spectral index remains

Standard Model (MSSM) are universal at some input scale, $M_{in}$, above the
supersymmetric gauge coupling unification scale, $M_{GUT}$. As in the

trilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters $A_0$. Going beyond previous
studies of such a super-GUT CMSSM scenario, we explore the constraints imposed
by the lower limit on the proton lifetime and the LHC measurement of the Higgs
mass, $m_h$. We find regions of $m_0$, $m_{1/2}$, $A_0$ and the parameters of
the SU(5) superpotential that are compatible with these and other
phenomenological constraints such as the density of cold dark matter, which we
assume to be provided by the lightest neutralino. Typically, these allowed
regions appear for $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ in the multi-TeV region, for suitable
values of the unknown SU(5) GUT-scale phases and superpotential couplings, and
with the ratio of supersymmetric Higgs vacuum expectation values $\tan \beta

low-entropy initial state, there is strong circumstantial evidence it develops
""branches"": a decomposition into orthogonal components that is
indistinguishable from the corresponding incoherent mixture with feasible
observations. Is this decomposition unique? Must the number of branches
increase with time? These questions are hard to answer because there is no
formal definition of branches, and most intuition is based on toy models with
arbitrarily preferred degrees of freedom. Here, assuming only the tensor
structure associated with spatial locality, I show that branch decompositions
are highly constrained just by the requirement that they exhibit redundant
local records. The set of all redundantly recorded observables induces a
preferred decomposition into simultaneous eigenstates unless their records are
highly extended and delicately overlapping, as exemplified by the Shor
error-correcting code. A maximum length scale for records is enough to
guarantee uniqueness. Speculatively, objective branch decompositions may speed
up numerical simulations of nonstationary many-body states, illuminate the
thermalization of closed systems, and demote measurement from fundamental
primitive in the quantum formalism.

the doubling of the rating coverage compared to the traditional CF technique,

specifically on cold-start users, we propose a ""Hybrid Trust-Aware

states to resonances in the continuum at the Mott transition temperature is
signaled by a jump of the phase shift at the threshold from $\pi$ to zero, in
accordance with the Levinson theorem. In particular, we demonstrate the
importance of accounting for the scattering continuum states, which ensures
that the total phase shift in each of the meson channels vanishes at high
energies, thus eliminating mesonic correlations from the thermodynamics at high
temperatures. In this way, we prove that the present approach provides a
unified description of the transition from a meson gas to a quark-gluon plasma.
We discuss the occurrence of an anomalous mode for mesons composed of quarks

introduced by the authors. Here the regions $S\left( t\right) $ that have been
searched by time $t$ are increasing from the starting point and have total

that each one starts at some point of an earlier one. This type of search is
often carried out by real life search teams in the hunt for missing persons,
escaped convicts, terrorists or lost airplanes. The paper which introduced this
type of search solved the adversarial problem (where $H$ is hidden to take a
long time to find) for the cases where $Q$ is a tree or is 2-arc-connected.
This paper solves the game on some additional families of networks. However the
main contribution is to give strategy classes which can be used on any network

  The conclusion is that TBM and the $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG sphere are equivalent.
They ultimately encode the same structure (a topological sphere with a measure,

In comparison to noninteracting metallic leads, Luttinger liquid leads involve
many-body correlations and the single-particle tunneling density of states
shows a power-law singularity at the chemical potential. Using the generalized
hierarchical equations of motion method, we assess the importance of the
singularity and the next-to-leading order many-body correlations. To this end,
we compare numerically converged results with second and first-order results of
the hybridization expansion that is inherent to our method. As a test case, we
study transport through a single-level quantum dot or molecule that can be
described by an Anderson impurity model. Cotunneling effects turn out to be
most pronounced for attractive interactions in the leads or repulsive ones if
an excitonic coupling between the dot and the leads is realized. We also find
that an interaction-induced negative differential conductance near the Coulomb
blockade thresholds is slightly suppressed as compared to a first-order and/or
rate equation result. Moreover, we find that the two-particle ($n$-particle)
correlations enter as a second-order ($n$-order) effect and are, thus, not very

high-resolution optical spectra of $\ell$ Carinae (P $\sim$ 35.5 d) recorded
during three heavy duty-cycle monitoring campaigns (in 2014, 2015, and 2016).
Spectral line variability is investigated via cross-correlation functions
(CCFs) computed using three sets of spectral lines (weak, solar, strong). A
metallic line velocity gradient, {\delta}v$_r$ (t), is computed as the
difference between weak and strong-line RVs. CCF shape indicators BIS
(asymmetry), FWHM, and depth all exhibit clear phase-dependent variability
patterns that differ from one pulsation cycle to the next. Weak-line CCFs
exhibit these effects more clearly than strong-line CCFs. BIS exhibits the most
peculiar modulated variability and can be used to identify the presence of
cycle-to-cycle modulated line profile variations. {\delta}v$_r$ (t) clearly
exhibits cycle-to-cycle differences that correlate very closely with modulated
BIS variability, suggesting perturbations of the atmospheric velocity field as
the cause for modulated spectral line variability. These perturbations are most
significant during contraction and are not in phase with the pulsation,
transmitting information between consecutive pulsation cycles. This work shows
RV curve modulation to be a consequence of atmospheric velocity gradient
perturbations. Possible origins of these perturbations and their impact on
Cepheid RV measurements as well as the projection factor used in
Baade-Wesselink-type distance determinations are discussed.

the axion, which solves the strong CP problem and accounts for the dark matter

these clouds is inferred from WMAP free-free fluxes. We measure the GMC mass,
the virial parameter, the star formation efficiency $\epsilon$ and the star

extended haloes of multiphase gas, the so-called 'circumgalactic medium' (CGM).
To study the survival of relatively cool gas (T < 10^5 K) in the CGM, we
performed a set of hydrodynamical simulations of cold (T = 10^4 K) neutral gas
clouds travelling through a hot (T = 2x10^6 K) and low-density (n = 10^-4
cm^-3) coronal medium, typical of Milky Way-like galaxies at large
galactocentric distances (~ 50-150 kpc). We explored the effects of different
initial values of relative velocity and radius of the clouds. Our simulations
were performed on a two-dimensional grid with constant mesh size (2 pc) and
they include radiative cooling, photoionization heating and thermal conduction.
We found that for large clouds (radii larger than 250 pc) the cool gas survives
for very long time (larger than 250 Myr): despite that they are partially
destroyed and fragmented into smaller cloudlets during their trajectory, the
total mass of cool gas decreases at very low rates. We found that thermal
conduction plays a significant role: its effect is to hinder formation of
hydrodynamical instabilities at the cloud-corona interface, keeping the cloud
compact and therefore more difficult to destroy. The distribution of column
densities extracted from our simulations are compatible with those observed for
low-temperature ions (e.g. SiII and SiIII) and for high-temperature ions (OVI)
once we take into account that OVI covers much more extended regions than the
cool gas and, therefore, it is more likely to be detected along a generic line
of sight.

on machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves.
This method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a
purely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts
($0.2<z<1.1$).
  Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN
redshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and
machine learning classification. We study the performance of different
algorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the
performance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the
Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and
photometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve
(AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our
best-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC
of $0.98$.
  We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type
Ia SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than $5\%$. When applied
to data from the first three years of SNLS, we obtain 529 events. We
investigate the differences between classifying simulated SNe, and real SN
survey data. In particular, we find that applying a thorough set of selection
cuts to the SN sample is essential for good classification. This work
demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of machine learning
classification in a high-$z$ SN survey with application to real SN data.

information are famously related via Gross' logarithmic Sobolev inequality
(LSI). These same functionals also separately satisfy convolution inequalities,
as proved by Stam. We establish a dimension-free inequality that interpolates
among these relations. Several interesting corollaries follow: (i) the deficit
in the LSI satisfies a convolution inequality itself; (ii) the deficit in the
LSI controls convergence in the entropic and Fisher information central limit
theorems; and (iii) the LSI is stable with respect to HWI jumps (i.e., a jump
in any of the convolution inequalities associated to the HWI functionals).
  Another consequence is that the convolution inequalities for Fisher
information and entropy powers are reversible in general, up to a factor
depending on the Stam defect. An improved form of Nelson's hypercontractivity
estimate also follows. Finally, we speculate on the possibility of an analogous

stars on Hayashi tracks. This effect is driven by the decay of $L_X$ once stars
develop radiative cores. $L_X$ decays faster with age for intermediate mass PMS
stars, the progenitors of main sequence A-type stars, compared to those of
lower mass. As almost all main sequence A-type stars show no detectable X-ray
emission, we may already be observing the loss of their coronae during their
PMS evolution. Although there is no direct link between the size or mass of the
radiative core and $L_X$, the longer stars have spent with partially convective
interiors, the weaker their X-ray emission becomes. This conference paper is a

developed in terms of a random walk model incorporating Rashba, linear and
cubic Dresselhaus, and intersubband spin-orbit couplings. The additional
subband degree of freedom introduces new characteristics to the persistent spin
helix (PSH) dynamics. As has been described before, for negligible intersubband
scattering rates, the sum of the magnetization of independent subbands leads to
a checkerboard pattern of crossed PSHs with long spin lifetime. For strong
intersubband scattering we model the fast subband dynamics as a new random
variable, yielding a dynamics set by averaged spin-orbit couplings of both
subbands. In this case the crossed PSH becomes isotropic, rendering circular
(Bessel) patterns with short spin lifetime. Additionally, a finite drift
velocity breaks the symmetry between parallel and transverse directions,
distorting and dragging the patterns. We find that the maximum spin lifetime
shifts away from the PSH regime with increasing drift velocity. We present
approximate analytical solutions for these cases and define their domain of
validity. Effects of magnetic fields and initial package broadening are also
discussed.

determines the couple's motion and a follower, who has a defined tendency to
follow the leader. Examples for such pairs are mother and child or two siblings
of different age. We examine the system properties and compare them to the case
of a homogeneous crowd. We find a strong impact on evacuation times for the
regime of strong pair coupling due to the occurrence of a clogging phenomenon.
In addition we obtain a non-trivial dependence of evacuation times on the
followers' coupling to the static floor field, which carries the information of
the shortest way to the exit location. In particular we find that systems with
fully passive followers, who are solely coupled to their leaders, show lower
evacuation times than homogeneous systems where all pedestrians have an equal

potential energy valley, plus transits, which move the system rapidly among the
multitude of such valleys. In its first application to the self intermediate
scattering function (SISF), V-T theory produced an accurate account of
molecular dynamics (MD) data at all wave numbers q and time t. Recently,
analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior
that was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more
accurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results. We derive and
discuss the theoretical equations for vibrational and transit contributions to
the SISF. The time evolution is divided into three successive intervals: the
vibrational interval when the vibrational contribution alone accurately
accounts for the MD data; the crossover when the vibrational contribution
saturates and the transit contribution becomes resolved; and the diffusive
interval when the transit contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD
data. The resulting theoretical error is extremely small at all q and t.
Comparison of V-T and mode-coupling theories for the MSD and SISF reveals that,
while their formulations differ substantially, their underlying atomic motions
are in logical correspondence.

traversing by 0 (doing nothing). We show that the specification-aligned model

which motivate four patches to the model. We present a series of experiments,
showing that browsers are inconsistent in their implementation of navigation

LAMOST spectra (R$\approx$1800) for large sample of field GKM dwarfs with solar
metallicity. Analysis show that active dwarfs, including late G- and early
K-type, have extra TiO absorption compare to inactive counterparts, indicating
the presence of cool spots on their surface. Active late K- and M-dwarfs show
deeper TiO2 and shallower TiO4 compare to inactive stars at a given TiO5, which
could be partly explained through cool spots. We estimated cool spot fractional
coverage for 304 Pleiades candidates by modelling their TiO2 (&TiO5) band
strength with respect to standard value. Results show that surface of large
fraction of K- and M-type members have very large spot coverage ($\sim$50%). We
analysed a correlation between spot coverage, rotation and the amplitude of
light variation, and found spot coverage on slow rotators ($R_{o}$ > 0.1)
increases with decreasing Rossby Number $R_{o}$. Interestingly, we detected a
saturation-like feature for spot coverage in fast rotators with a saturation
level of 40%-50%. In addition, spot distribution in hotter fast rotators show
more symmetrical compare to slow rotators. More interestingly, we detected
large spot coverage in many M type members with no or little light variation.
In bigger picture, these results provide important constraints for stellar
dynamo on these cool active stars.

development of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics. However, this
approach presents two problems. First, it predicts that the entropy is only
defined on a discrete set of energies for finite, quantum systems, while
thermodynamics requires the entropy to be a continuous function of the energy.
Second, it fails to satisfy the stability condition ($\Delta S / \Delta U < 0$)
for first-order transitions with both classical and quantum systems. Swendsen
has recently shown that the source of these problems lies in the microcanonical
ensemble itself, which contains only energy eigenstates and excludes their
linear combinations. To the contrary, if the system of interest has ever been
in thermal contact with another system, it will be described by a probability
distribution over many eigenstates that is equivalent to the canonical ensemble
for sufficiently large systems. Novotny et al. have recently supported this
picture by dynamical numerical calculations for a quantum mechanical model, in
which they showed the approach to a canonical distribution for up to 40 quantum
spins. By simplifying the problem to calculate only the equilibrium properties,
we are able to extend the demonstration to more than a million particles.

excellent n-type thermoelectric material, while the thermoelectric performance

process of equilibration, the probability distributions, the composition
profiles for the components, and the component diffusivities within the
interface zone. It is shown that the equilibrium in the solid state associated
with the complete phase separation in binary eutectic is accompanied by
formation of the steady disordered diffusion zone at the boundary of the
crystalline components. At higher temperatures, closer to the eutectic point,
the increase in the width of the steady diffusion zone is observed. The
particle diffusivities grow therewith to the numbers typical for the liquid
phase. Above the eutectic point, the steady zone does not form, instead, the
complete contact melting in the system occurs. The results of simulations
indicate that during the temperature increase the phenomenon of contact melting
is preceded by the similar process spatially localized in the vicinity of the
interface.

where there are a base station (BS) with M receive antennas, K mobile users
each with a single antenna, and an eavesdropper with N receive antennas. The
closed-form expressions of the achievable ergodic secrecy sumrates (ESSR) for a
random k users selection scheme in the high and low SNR regimes are presented.
It is shown that the scaling behavior of ESSR with respect to the number of
served users k can be quite different under different system configurations,
determined by the numbers of the BS antennas and that of the eavesdropper
antennas. In order to achieve a multiuser gain, two low-complexity user
selection schemes are proposed under different assumptions on the
eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI). The closed-form expressions of
the achievable ESSRs and the multiuser secrecy gains of the two schemes are
also presented in both low and high SNR regimes. We observe that, as k
increases, the multiuser secrecy gain increases, while the ESSR may decrease.
Therefore, when N is much larger than M, serving one user with the strongest
channel (TDMA-like) is a favourable secrecy scheme, where the ESSR scales with
root square of 2 log K.

clear gap features: substantial suppression in the low-frequency optical
conductivity, alongside a spectral weight transfer from low to high
frequencies. Here, we study the detailed temperature dependence of the optical
response in three different series of the Ba122 system
[Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and
BaFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$]. Intriguingly, we found that the
suppression of the low-frequency optical conductivity and spectral weight
transfer appear at a temperature $T^{\ast}$ much higher than the SDW transition
temperature $T_{SDW}$. Since this behavior has the same optical feature and
energy scale as the SDW order, we attribute it to SDW fluctuations.
Furthermore, $T^{\ast}$ is suppressed with doping, closely following the doping
dependence of the nematic fluctuations detected by other techniques. These
results suggest that the magnetic and nematic orders have an intimate
relationship, in favor of the magnetic-fluctuation-driven nematicity scenario

their association with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) holds the key to
deciphering the central engine of LGRBs, which refrains from being unveiled
despite decades of investigation. Among the two popularly hypothesized types of
central engine, i.e., black holes and strongly magnetized neutron stars
(magnetars), there is mounting evidence that the central engine of
GRB-associated SNe (GRB-SNe) is rapidly rotating magnetars. Theoretical
analysis also suggests that magnetars could be the central engine of SNe Ic-BL.
What puzzled the researchers is the fact that light curve modeling indicates
that as much as 0.2-0.5 solar mass of 56Ni was synthesized during the explosion
of the SNe Ic-BL, which is unfortunately in direct conflict with current
state-of-the-art understanding of magnetar-powered 56Ni synthesis. Here we
propose a dynamic model of magnetar-powered SNe to take into account the
acceleration of the ejecta by the magnetar, as well as the thermalization of
the injected energy. Assuming that the SN kinetic energy comes exclusively from
the magnetar acceleration, we find that although a major fraction of the
rotational energy of the magnetar is to accelerate the SNe ejecta, a tiny
fraction of this energy deposited as thermal energy of the ejecta is enough to
reduce the needed 56Ni to 0.06 solar mass for both SN 1997ef and SN 2007ru. We
therefore suggest that magnetars could power SNe Ic-BL both in aspects of
energetics and of 56Ni synthesis.

functional theory for axially deformed nuclei with the treatment of pairing
correlations by BCS approach, and apply this approach for the study of shape
evolutions in $^{72,74}$Kr with increasing temperatures. For $^{72}$Kr, with
temperature increasing, the nucleus firstly experiences a relatively quick
weakening in oblate deformation at temperature $T \sim0.9$ MeV, and then
changes from oblate to spherical at $T \sim2.1$ MeV. For $^{74}$Kr, its global
minimum locates at quadroupole deformation $\beta_2 \sim -0.14$ and abruptly
changes to spherical at $T\sim 1.7$ MeV. The proton pairing transition occurs
at critical temperature 0.6 MeV following the rule $T_c =0.6 \Delta_p (0)$

signatures of the above pairing transition and shape changes can be found in

line system in the spectra of quasar SDSS J112526.12+002901.3 presents an
interesting example, in which the rarely detected hydrogen Balmer and
metastable He I absorption lines are found redshifted to the quasar's rest
frame along with the low-ionization metal absorption lines Mg II, Fe II, etc.
The repeated SDSS spectroscopic observations suggest a transverse velocity
smaller than the radial velocity. The motion of the absorbing medium is thus
dominated by infall. The He I* lines present a powerful probe to the strength
of ionizing flux, while the Balmer lines imply a dense environment. With the
help of photoionization simulations, we find the absorbing medium is exposed to
the radiation with ionization parameter $U\approx 10^{-1.8}$, and the density
is $n(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^9\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Thus the absorbing medium is
located $\sim 4\ \mathrm{pc}$ away from the central engine. According to the
similarity in the distance and physical conditions between the absorbing medium
and the torus, we strongly propose the absorption line system as a candidate
for the accretion inflow which originates from the inner surface of the torus.

as a low-rank subspace tracking problem for normal flows under incomplete
observations, and an outlier detection problem for abnormal flows. Since
traffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and
outliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential.
To this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized
time-structured traffic tensor for normal flows based on the Candecomp/PARAFAC
decomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. We
estimate abnormal flows as outlier sparse flows via sparsity maximization in
the underlying under-constrained linear-inverse problem. A major advantage is
that our algorithm estimates normal flows by low-dimensional matrices with
time-directional features as well as the spatial correlation of multiple links
without using the past observed measurements and the past model parameters.
Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves
faster convergence per iteration of model approximation, and better volume
anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

proteins and it is currently believed that most of these are not under
evolutionary constraint. However given the abundance non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and
its strong affinity for inter-RNA binding, these molecules have the potential
to regulate proteins in a highly distributed way, similar to artificial neural
networks. We explore this analogy by devising a simple architecture for a
biochemical network that can function as an associative memory. We show that
the steady state solution for this chemical network has the same structure as
an associative memory neural network model. By allowing the choice of
equilibrium constants between different ncRNA species, the concentration of
unbound ncRNA can be made to follow any pattern and many patterns can be stored
simultaneously. The model is studied numerically and within certain parameter
regimes it functions as predicted. Even if the starting concentration pattern
is quite different, it is shown to converge to the original pattern most of the
time. The network is also robust to mutations in equilibrium constants. This
calls into question the criteria for deciding if a sequence is under

information loss caused by ignoring noise correlations during optimal brain
computations. For more than a decade, the measure here called $ \Delta I^{DL} $
has been believed exact. However, we have recently shown that it can exceed the
information loss $ \Delta I^{B} $ caused by optimal decoders constructed
ignoring noise correlations. Unfortunately, the different information notions
underlying $ \Delta I^{DL} $ and $ \Delta I^{B} $, and the putative rigorous
information-theoretical derivation of $ \Delta I^{DL} $, both render unclear
whether those findings indicate either flaws in $ \Delta I^{DL} $ or major
departures from traditional relations between information and decoding. Here we
resolve this paradox and prove that, under certain conditions, observing $
\Delta I^{DL} {>}\Delta I^{B} $ implies that $ \Delta I^{DL} $ is flawed.
Motivated by this analysis, we test both measures using neural populations that
transmit independent information. Our results show that $ \Delta I^{DL} $ may
deem noise correlations more important when decoding the populations together
than when decoding them in parallel, whereas the opposite may occur for $
\Delta I^{B} $. We trace these phenomena back, for $ \Delta I^{B} $, to the
choice of tie-breaking rules, and for $ \Delta I^{DL} $, to unforeseen
limitations within its information-theoretical foundations. Our study
contributes with better estimates that potentially improve theoretical and
experimental inferences currently drawn from $ \Delta I^{DL} $ without noticing
that it may constitute an upper bound. On the practical side, our results
promote the design of optimal decoding algorithms and neuroprosthetics without
recording noise correlations, thereby saving experimental and computational
resources.

mid-plane traced by the Outer Arm seems to be slightly displaced from the
IAU-defined plane on a large scale, which could be explained by the warped
plane at large Galactocentric distances of >~10 kpc and the apparent tilted
mid-plane to the projected IAU-defined plane caused by the Sun's z-height above
the disk for distances near and within the Solar circle. If the inner plane of
our Galaxy is flat, we can derive an upper limit of the Sun's offset of ~17.1
pc above the physical mid-plane of the Milky Way. We also discuss the
correlations between the physical parameters of the distant MCs, which is quite
consistent with the result of other studies of this parameter.

in terms of quantum jumps. Our starting point is a master equation in Lindblad
form, which can be taken as the quantum analogue of the rate equation for a
classical continuous-time Markov chain. The quantum jump method is well known
in the quantum optics community and has also been applied to simulate open
quantum walks in discrete time. This method however, is well-suited to
continuous-time problems. It is shown here that a continuous-time hitting
problem is amenable to analysis via quantum jumps: The hitting time can be
defined as the time of the first jump. Using this fact, we derive the
distribution of hitting times and explicit exressions for its statistical
moments. Simple examples are considered to illustrate the final results. We
then show that the hitting statistics obtained via quantum jumps is consistent
with a previous definition for a measured walk in discrete time
[Phys.~Rev.~A~{\bf 73}, 032341 (2006)] (when generalised to allow for
non-unitary evolution and in the limit of small time steps). A caveat of the
quantum-jump approach is that it relies on the final state (the state which we
want to hit) to share only incoherent edges with other vertices in the graph.
We propose a simple remedy to restore the applicability of quantum jumps when
this is not the case and show that the hitting-time statistics will again
converge to that obtained from the measured discrete walk in appropriate
limits.

leptoquark, $\Delta$, and a scalar diquark, $S$. The new scalars $\Delta$ and
$S$ carry the standard model $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ quantum
numbers $(3,1,-1/3)$ and $(6,1,-2/3)$, respectively. The neutrino masses are
generated at the two-loop level, as in the Zee-Babu model\cite{Zee-Babu}, and
$\Delta/S$ plays the role of the doubly/singly charged scalar in the Zee-Babu
model. With a moderate working assumption that the magnitudes of the six Yukawa
couplings between $S$ and the down-type quarks are of the same order, strong
connections are found between the neutrino masses and the charged lepton flavor
violating processes. In particular, we study $Z\rightarrow \overline{l} l'$,
and $l\rightarrow l' \gamma$ and find that some portions of the parameter space
of this model are within the reach of the planned charged lepton flavor
violating experiments. Interesting lower bounds are predicted that
$B(Z\rightarrow \overline{l} l')\gtrsim
10^{-16}-10^{-14}(10^{-14})\times(1\mbox{TeV}\cdot m_S/7 m_\Delta^2)^2$ and

\mbox{TeV}\cdot m_S/7 m_\Delta^2)^2$ for neutrino masses being the
normal(inverted) hierarchical pattern. The type of neutrino mass hierarchy
could also be determined by measuring the charged lepton flavor violating
double ratios. Moreover, definite leptoquark decay branching ratios are
predicted when there is no Yukawa interaction between the right-handed fermions
and $\Delta$ ( the branching fraction of $\Delta$ to a charged lepton and a
quark is 50\%), which could help refine the collider search limit on the scalar
leptoquark mass.

proposed to be a complementary and less expensive way -- in terms of
observational time -- to investigate pulsations in massive stars. We assess to
what extent this ubiquitous non-rotational broadening component shaping the
line profiles of O stars and B supergiants is a spectroscopic signature of
pulsation modes driven by a heat mechanism. We compute stellar main sequence
and post-main sequence models from 3 to 70Msun with the ATON stellar evolution
code and determine the instability domains for heat-driven modes for degrees
l=1-20 using the adiabatic and non-adiabatic codes LOSC and MAD. We use the
observational material presented in Sim\'on-D\'iaz et al. (2016) to investigate
possible correlations between the single snapshot line-broadening properties of
a sample of ~260 O and B-type stars and their location inside/outside the
various predicted instability domains. We present an homogeneous prediction for
the non-radial instability domains of massive stars for degree l up to 20. We
provide a global picture of what to expect from an observational point of view
in terms of frequency range of excited modes, and investigate the behavior of
the instabilities with stellar evolution and increasing degree of the mode.
Furthermore, our pulsational stability analysis, once compared to the empirical
results of Sim\'on-D\'iaz et al. (2016), indicates that stellar oscillations
originated by a heat mechanism can not explain alone the occurrence of the
large non-rotational line-broadening component commonly detected in the O star

connecting two surface-projected Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities. An
intriguing question is what determines the connectivity of surface Fermi arcs,
when multiple pairs of Weyl nodes are present. To answer this question, we
first show that the locations of surface Fermi arcs are predominantly
determined by the condition that the Zak phase integrated along the normal
direction to the surface is $\pi$. More importantly, the Zak phase can reveal
the peculiar topological structure of Weyl semimetal directly in the bulk.
Here, we show that the non-trivial winding of the Zak phase around each
projected Weyl node manifests itself as a topological defect of the
Wannier-Stark ladder, the energy eigenstates emerging under an electric field.
Remarkably, this structure leads to ""bulk Fermi arcs,"" i.e., open line segments
in the bulk momentum spectra. It is argued that bulk Fermi arcs should exist in
conjunction with the surface counterparts to conserve the Weyl fermion number
under an electric field, which is supported by explicit numerical evidence.

perspective of model theory, and present several applications to C*-dynamics.
Firstly, we prove that the continuous part of the central sequence algebra of a
strongly self-absorbing action is indistinguishable from the continuous part of
the sequence algebra, and in fact equivariantly isomorphic under the Continuum
Hypothesis. As another application, we present a unified approach to several
dimensional inequalities in C*-algebras, which is done through the notion of
order zero dimension for an (equivariant) *-homomorphism. Finiteness of the
order zero dimension implies that the dimension of the target algebra can be
bounded by the dimension of the domain. The dimension can be, among others,
decomposition rank, nuclear dimension, or Rokhlin dimension. As a consequence,
we obtain new inequalities for these quantities.
  As a third application we obtain the following result: if a C*-algebra $A$
absorbs a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra $D$, and $\alpha $ is an action of
a compact group $G$ on $A$ with finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers,
then $\alpha $ absorbs any strongly self-absorbing action of $G$ on $% D$. This
has a number of interesting consequences, already in the case of the trivial
action on $D$. For example, we deduce that $D$-stability passes from $A$ to the
crossed product. Additionally, in many cases of interest, our result restricts
the possible values of the Rokhlin dimension to $0, 1$ and $\infty$, showing a
striking parallel to the behavior of the nuclear dimension for simple
C*-algebras. We also show that an action of a finite group with finite Rokhlin
dimension with commuting towers automatically has the Rokhlin property if the
algebra is UHF-absorbing.

game theory has been applied to study the spectrum sharing in wireless networks
for a long time. However, the scale of wireless network in existing studies is
relatively small. In this paper, we introduce a novel game and model the
spectrum sharing problem as an aggregative game for large-scale, heterogeneous,
and dynamic networks. The massive usage of spectrum also leads to easier
privacy divulgence of spectrum users' actions, which calls for privacy and
truthfulness guarantees in wireless network. In a large decentralized scenario,
each user has no priori about other users' decisions, which forms an incomplete
information game. A ""weak mediator"", e.g., the base station or licensed
spectrum regulator, is introduced and turns this game into a complete one,
which is essential to reach a Nash equilibrium (NE). By utilizing past
experience on the channel access, we propose an online learning algorithm to
improve the utility of each user, achieving NE over time. Our learning
algorithm also provides no regret guarantee to each user. Our mechanism admits
an approximate ex-post NE. We also prove that it satisfies the joint
differential privacy and is incentive-compatible. Efficiency of the approximate
NE is evaluated, and the innovative scaling law results are disclosed. Finally,

anonymous communication has drastically increased. Several such systems have
been proposed in the literature, each of which offers anonymity guarantees in
different scenarios and under different assumptions, reflecting the plurality
of approaches for how messages can be anonymously routed to their destination.
Understanding this space of competing approaches with their different
guarantees and assumptions is vital for users to understand the consequences of
different design options.

self-consistent, semi-analytic models of putative self-gravitating discs for
five candidate disc systems. Our aim is not to fit exactly the observations,
but to demonstrate that the expected dust continuum emission from marginally
unstable self-gravitating discs can be quite weak, due to high optical depth at
the midplane even at millimetre wavelengths. In the best cases, the models
produce ""observable"" disc masses within a factor of <1.5 of those observed,
with midplane dust temperatures comparable to measured temperatures from
molecular line emission. We find in two cases that a self-gravitating disc
model compares well with observations. If these discs are self-gravitating,
they satisfy the conditions for disc fragmentation in their outer regions.
These systems may hence have as-yet-unresolved low mass stellar companions, and
are thus promising targets for future high angular resolution observations.

to analyse independently the B component of the 16Cyg binary system using the
inversion of an indicator dedicated to analyse core conditions, denoted tu.
Using this independent determination, we wish to analyse any differences

differences between the A and B components. The tu indicator for 16CygB shows a
disagreement with models including microscopic diffusion and sharing the
chemical composition previously derived for 16CygA. Small changes in chemical
composition are insufficient to solve the problem but that extra mixing can
account for the differences seen between both stars. We use a parametric

and every palindromic substring of $S$ which contains interval $[x, y]$ and is

For special combinations of N and r and appropriate parameter choices we
observe games within games, that is, different coexisting games, depending on
the spatial resolution. As concrete and simplest example we analyze the (6,3)
game. Once the players segregate from a random initial distribution, domains
emerge, which effectively play a (2,1)-game on the coarse scale of domain
diameters, while agents inside the domains play (3,1) (rock-paper-scissors),
leading to spiral formation with species chasing each other. As the (2,1)-game
has a winner in the end, the coexistence of domains is transient, while agents
inside the remaining domain coexist, until demographic fluctuations lead to
extinction of all but one species in the very end. This means that we observe a
dynamical generation of multiple space and time scales with emerging
re-organization of players upon segregation, starting from a simple set of
rules on the smallest scale and changed rules from the coarser perspective.
These observations are based on Gillespie simulations. We discuss the
deterministic limit derived from a van Kampen expansion. The linear stability
analysis predicts the number of forming domains, their composition in terms of
species; it also explains the instability of interfaces between domains, which
drives their extinction; spiral patterns are identified as motion along
heteroclinic cycles. The numerical solutions reproduce the observed patterns of
the Gillespie simulations including even extinction events, so that the
mean-field analysis here is very conclusive, which is due to the specific
implementation of rules.

However, it faces to the cold start problem when generating the first word as
there is no previous word to refer. Existing work mainly use a special start

that there is not a learnable relationship between words and the start symbol.
Furthermore, it may lead to the error accumulation for decoding when the first

easily implemented with a linear-scaling computational cost, enabling
applications to supramolecular systems. The benefits of the MBIS method are
demonstrated with systematic applications to molecular databases and extended

Low-Rank Representation (LRR) based method is quite superior in terms of its
effectiveness, intuitiveness and robustness to noise corruptions. However, it
aggressively tries to learn a common low-dimensional subspace for multi-view
data, while inattentively ignoring the local manifold structure in each view,
which is critically important to the spectral clustering; worse still, the
low-rank minimization is enforced to achieve the data correlation consensus
among all views, failing to flexibly preserve the local manifold structure for
each view. In this paper, 1) we propose a multi-graph laplacian regularized LRR
with each graph laplacian corresponding to one view to characterize its local
manifold structure. 2) Instead of directly enforcing the low-rank minimization
among all views for correlation consensus, we separately impose low-rank
constraint on each view, coupled with a mutual structural consensus constraint,
where it is able to not only well preserve the local manifold structure but
also serve as a constraint for that from other views, which iteratively makes
the views more agreeable. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view data
sets demonstrate its superiority.

oriented perpendicular to the previously reported bipolar molecular outflow
from MM1. Modelling of the compact gas kinematics suggests a structure
undergoing rotation around the peak of the dust continuum emission. The
rotational profile can be well fit by a model of a Keplerian disc, including
infall, surrounding an enclosed mass of 30-60M$_{\odot}$, of which
2-3M$_{\odot}$ is attributed to the disc. From modelling the CH$_3$CN emission,
we determine that two temperature components, of 150 K and 230 K, are required
to adequately reproduce the spectra. Our 0.9 and 3.0cm VLA continuum data
exhibit an excess above the level expected from dust emission; the full

Bradlow-Higgs triples on a smooth projective curve $C$. $(E,\varphi, s)$ is a
Bradlow-Higgs triple if $(E,\varphi)$ is a Higgs bundle and $s$ is a non-zero
global section of $E$. There is a family of stability conditions for triples
that depends on a positive real parameter $\sigma$. The moduli spaces
$\mathcal{M}_\sigma^{r,d}$ of $\sigma$-semistable triples of rank $r$ and
degree $d$ vary with $\sigma$. The phenomenon arising from this is known as
wall-crossing. In the first half of the thesis we will examine how the moduli
spaces $\mathcal{M}_\sigma^{r,d}$ and their universal additive invariants
change as $\sigma$ varies, for the case $r=2$. In particular we will study the
case of $\sigma$ very close to 0, for which $\mathcal{M}_\sigma^{r,d}$ relates
to the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles, and $\sigma$ very large, for which
$\mathcal{M}_\sigma^{r,d}$ is a relative Hilbert scheme of points for the
family of spectral curves. Some of these results will be generalized to
Bradlow-Higgs triples with poles. In the second half we will prove a formula
relating the cohomology of $\mathcal{M}_\sigma^{2,d}$ for small $\sigma$ and
$d$ odd and the perverse filtration on the cohomology of the moduli space of
stable Higgs bundles. The formula is not far from the generalized Macdonald
formulas found in the works of Migliorini-Shende, Maulik-Yun and
Migliorini-Shende-Viviani. We will also partially generalize this result to the
case of rank greater than 2.

interaction (FSI) problems that allows for choosing fully implicit, single-step
and single-stage time integration schemes in the structure and fluid field
independently, and hence is tailored to the needs of the individual field. The
independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal
consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational
costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both
structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only.
Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor
step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full
detail of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully
consistent in its non-conforming temporal and spatial discretization. The
incorporated mortar approach allows for non-matching spatial discretizations of
the fluid and solid domain at the FSI interface and is fully integrated in the
resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of
numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of
essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the
positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put
on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure

vision problems. Due to the inherent lack of training data, a robust approach
for constructing a target appearance model is crucial. Recently,
discriminatively learned correlation filters (DCF) have been successfully
applied to address this problem for tracking. These methods utilize a periodic
assumption of the training samples to efficiently learn a classifier on all
patches in the target neighborhood. However, the periodic assumption also
introduces unwanted boundary effects, which severely degrade the quality of the
tracking model.
  We propose Spatially Regularized Discriminative Correlation Filters (SRDCF)
for tracking. A spatial regularization component is introduced in the learning
to penalize correlation filter coefficients depending on their spatial
location. Our SRDCF formulation allows the correlation filters to be learned on
a significantly larger set of negative training samples, without corrupting the
positive samples. We further propose an optimization strategy, based on the
iterative Gauss-Seidel method, for efficient online learning of our SRDCF.
Experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets: OTB-2013, ALOV++,
OTB-2015, and VOT2014. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all
four datasets. On OTB-2013 and OTB-2015, we obtain an absolute gain of 8.0% and

for $a, b, c$ smooth real functions defined on an open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Generically, solutions of a BDE are given as leaves of a pair of foliations,
and the appropriate way to define the action of a symmetry must depend not only
whether it preserves or inverts the plane orientation, but also whether it
preserves or interchanges the foliations. The first main result reveals this
dependence, which is given algebraically by a formula relating three group
homomorphisms defined on the symmetry group of the BDE. The second main result
adapts algebraic methods from invariant theory for representations of compact
Lie groups on the space of quadratic forms on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$. With
that we obtain an algorithm to compute general expressions of quadratic forms.
Now, symmetric quadratic 1-forms are in one-to-one corrspondence with

anisotropic, and to solve differential equations related to these functions.
One way such anisotropy arises is that information transfer along one spatial
direction is much faster than in others. In this situation, the derivative of
the function is small in the local direction of a vector field $\mathbf{b}$. In
order to define a discrete representation, a set of surfaces $M_i$ indexed by
an integer $i$ are chosen such that mapping along the field $\mathbf{b}$
induces a one-to-one relation between the points on surface $M_i$ to those on
$M_{i+1}$. For simple cases $M_i$ may be surfaces of constant coordinate value.
On each surface $M_i$, a function description is constructed using basis
functions defined on a regular structured mesh. The definition of each basis
function is extended from the surface $M$ along the lines of the field
$\mathbf{b}$ by multiplying it by a smooth compact support function whose
argument increases with distance along $\mathbf{b}$. Function values are
evaluated by summing contributions associated with each surface $M_i$. This
does not require any special connectivity of the meshes used in the
neighbouring surfaces $M$, which substantially simplifies the meshing problem
compared to attempting to find a space filling anisotropic mesh. We explore the
numerical properties of the scheme, and show that it can be used to efficiently
solve differential equations for certain anisotropic problems.

radiation environment created by the two stars, but also on the perturbations
to planetary orbits and rotation produced by the gravitational field of the
binary and neighbouring planets. Habitable planets in binaries may therefore
experience significant perturbations in orbit and spin. The direct effects of
orbital resonances and secular evolution on the climate of binary planets
remain largely unconsidered.
  We present latitudinal energy balance modelling of exoplanet climates with
direct coupling to an N Body integrator and an obliquity evolution model. This
allows us to simultaneously investigate the thermal and dynamical evolution of
planets orbiting binary stars, and discover gravito-climatic oscillations on
dynamical and secular timescales.
  We investigate the Kepler-47 and Alpha Centauri systems as archetypes of P
and S type binary systems respectively. In the first case, Earthlike planets
would experience rapid Milankovitch cycles (of order 1000 years) in
eccentricity, obliquity and precession, inducing temperature oscillations of
similar periods (modulated by other planets in the system). These secular
temperature variations have amplitudes similar to those induced on the much
shorter timescale of the binary period.
  In the Alpha Centauri system, the influence of the secondary produces
eccentricity variations on 15,000 year timescales. This produces climate
oscillations of similar strength to the variation on the orbital timescale of
the binary. Phase drifts between eccentricity and obliquity oscillations
creates further cycles that are of order 100,000 years in duration, which are
further modulated by neighbouring planets.

material subsets whose advective evolution is metastable under weak diffusion.
For their detection, we first transform the Eulerian advection-diffusion
equation to Lagrangian coordinates, in which it takes the form of a
time-dependent diffusion or heat equation. By this coordinate transformation,
the reversible effects of advection are separated from the irreversible joint
effects of advection and diffusion. In this framework, LCSs express themselves
as (boundaries of) metastable sets under the Lagrangian diffusion process. In
the case of spatially homogeneous isotropic diffusion, averaging the
time-dependent family of Lagrangian diffusion operators yields Froyland's
dynamic Laplacian. In the associated geometric heat equation, the distribution
of heat is governed by the dynamically induced intrinsic geometry on the
material manifold, to which we refer as the geometry of mixing. We study and
visualize this geometry in detail, and discuss connections between geometric
features and LCSs viewed as diffusion barriers in two numerical examples. Our
approach facilitates the discovery of connections between some prominent
methods for coherent structure detection: the dynamic isoperimetry methodology,
the variational geometric approaches to elliptic LCSs, a class of graph
Laplacian-based methods and the effective diffusivity framework used in
physical oceanography.

score (PS)-based approach to estimate causal effects in observational studies
at risk of confounding bias. A major issue when estimating the PS is the
presence of partially observed covariates. Multiple imputation (MI) is a
natural approach to handle missing data on covariates, but its use in the PS
context raises three important questions: (i) should we apply Rubin's rules to
the IPTW treatment effect estimates or to the PS estimates themselves? (ii)
does the outcome have to be included in the imputation model? (iii) how should
we estimate the variance of the IPTW estimator after MI? We performed a
simulation study focusing on the effect of a binary treatment on a binary
outcome with three confounders (two of them partially observed). We used MI
with chained equations to create complete datasets and compared three ways of
combining the results: combining treatment effect estimates (MIte); combining
the PS across the imputed datasets (MIps); or combining the PS parameters and
estimating the PS of the average covariates across the imputed datasets
(MIpar). We also compared the performance of these methods to complete case
(CC) analysis and the missingness pattern (MP) approach, a method which uses a
different PS model for each pattern of missingness. We also studied empirically
the consistency of these 3 MI estimators. Under a missing at random (MAR)
mechanism, CC and MP analyses were biased in most cases when estimating the
marginal treatment effect, whereas MI approaches had good performance in
reducing bias as long as the outcome was included in the imputation model.
However, only MIte was unbiased in all the studied scenarios and Rubin's rules
provided good variance estimates for MIte.

solar physics, and involved in various eruption phenomena. Twist,
characterizing how the magnetic field lines wind around a main axis, is an
intrinsic property of MFRs, closely related to the magnetic free energy and
stableness. So far it is unclear how much amount of twist is carried by MFRs in
the solar atmosphere and in heliosphere and what role the twist played in the
eruptions of MFRs. Contrasting to the solar MFRs, there are lots of in-situ
measurements of magnetic clouds (MCs), the large-scale MFRs in interplanetary
space, providing some important information of the twist of MFRs. Thus,
starting from MCs, we investigate the twist of interplanetary MFRs with the aid
of a velocity-modified uniform-twist force-free flux rope model. It is found
that most of MCs can be roughly fitted by the model and nearly half of them can
be fitted fairly well though the derived twist is probably over-estimated by a
factor of 2.5. By applying the model to 115 MCs observed at 1 AU, we find that
(1) the twist angles of interplanetary MFRs generally follow a trend of about
$0.6\frac{l}{R}$ radians, where $\frac{l}{R}$ is the aspect ratio of a MFR,
with a cutoff at about $12\pi$ radians AU$^{-1}$, (2) most of them are
significantly larger than $2.5\pi$ radians but well bounded by $2\frac{l}{R}$
radians, (3) strongly twisted magnetic field lines probably limit the expansion
and size of MFRs, and (4) the magnetic field lines in the legs wind more
tightly than those in the leading part of MFRs. These results not only advance
our understanding of the properties and behavior of interplanetary MFRs, but
also shed light on the formation and eruption of MFRs in the solar atmosphere.
A discussion about the twist and stableness of solar MFRs are therefore given.

\Box B$ consists of all vectors ${\bf x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in S$ for which
there exist disjoint coordinate subsets $K$ and $L$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such
that given the coordinates $x_i, i \in K$ one has that ${\bf x} \in A$
regardless of the values of ${\bf x}$ on the remaining coordinates, and
likewise that ${\bf x} \in B$ given the coordinates {$x_j, j \in L$}.
  For a finite product of discrete spaces endowed with a product measure, the
BKR inequality
  $$
  P(A \Box B) \le P(A)P(B) \quad (1)
  $$
  was conjectured by van den Berg and Kesten [3] and proved by Reimer [13].
  In [7] inequality (1) was extended to general product probability spaces,
replacing $A \Box B$ by the set $A \Box_{11} B$ consisting of those outcomes
${\bf x}$ which only assure with probability one that ${\bf x} \in A$ and ${\bf
x} \in B$ based only on the revealed coordinates in $K$ and $L$ as above. A
strengthening of the original BKR inequality (1) results, due to the fact that
$A \Box B \subseteq A \Box_{11} B$. In particular, it may be the case that $A
\Box B$ is empty, while $A \Box_{11} B$ is not.
  We propose the further extension $A \Box_{st} B$ depending on probability
thresholds $s$ and $t$, where $A \Box_{11} B$ is the special case where both
$s$ and $t$ take the value one. The outcomes ${\bf x}$ in $A \Box_{st} B$ are
those for which disjoint sets of coordinates $K$ and $L$ exist such that given
the values of $\bf x$ on the revealed set of coordinates $K$, the probability
that $A$ occurs is at least $s$, and given the coordinates of $\bf x$ in $L$,
the probability of $B$ is at least $t$. We provide simple examples that
illustrate the utility of these extensions.

remained an open question for more than 50 years. The extremely low carrier
densities ($10^{18}$ - $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$) at which superconductivity occurs
suggests an unconventional origin of superconductivity outside of the adiabatic
limit on which the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Migdal-Eliashberg (ME)
theories are based. We take advantage of a newly developed method for
engineering band alignments at oxide interfaces and access the electronic
structure of Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ using high resolution tunneling spectroscopy.
We observe strong coupling to the highest energy longitudinal optic (LO) phonon
branch and estimate the doping evolution of the dimensionless electron-phonon
interaction strength ($\lambda$). Upon cooling below the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$), we observe a single superconducting
gap corresponding to the weak-coupling limit of BCS theory, indicating an order
of magnitude smaller coupling ($\lambda_{\textrm{BCS}} \approx 0.1$). These
results suggest that despite the strong normal state interaction with
electrons, the highest LO phonon does not provide a dominant contribution to
pairing. They further demonstrate that SrTiO$_3$ is an ideal system to probe
superconductivity over a wide range of carrier density, adiabatic parameter,
and electron-phonon coupling strength.

that in such theories the $S$ matrix cannot be defined in the usual way.
Typically, this is not viewed as a big problem since one is interested in cross
sections, in which the divergences cancel. Recently, one particular type of
divergences known as soft theorems was connected to a symmetry principle - the
antipodal matching of large gauge transformations. However, there is a way to
define an IR finite $S$ matrix in QED and similar theories by dropping the
assumption of trivial asymptotic dynamics. In the present paper we investigate
the role of soft theorems and invariance under large gauge transformations in
the context of the finite $S$ matrix. Before doing so, the construction of
asymptotic dynamics is reviewed and extended. The key results are that
subleading soft factors can be included in a natural way in the asymptotic
dynamics. Once this is done, soft modes decouple from the IR finite $S$ matrix
and this decoupling, which can be understood as a spontaneously broken
symmetry, is equivalent to the invariance under large gauge transformations (or
in other words to the antipodal matching). To show this equivalence a special
property for field operators at null infinity, i.e. for the program of
asymptotic quantization, is assumed. Finally, we speculate about the
modification of the decoupling of soft modes in the presence of black holes.

based on C++ which enables performance advantages due to direct native code
compilation, a more cache-friendly memory layout, and explicit memory
management. In particular, Thrill uses template meta-programming to compile
chains of subsequent local operations into a single binary routine without
intermediate buffering and with minimal indirections. Second, Thrill uses
arrays rather than multisets as its primary data structure which enables
additional operations like sorting, prefix sums, window scans, or combining
corresponding fields of several arrays (zipping). We compare Thrill with Apache

consistently faster and often several times faster than the other frameworks.

  Classes",,,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowhere dense classes of graphs are very general classes of uniformly sparse
graphs with several seemingly unrelated characterisations. From an algorithmic
perspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform
quasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be
particularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on
nowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the
equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a
non-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,
making them infeasible in practice.
  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular
from a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish
polynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform
quasi-wideness.
  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem
kernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in
polynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only
(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for
every fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating
set problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs. This result is particularly
interesting, as it implies that for every class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs which
is closed under subgraphs, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem admits a
kernel on $\mathcal{C}$ for every value of $r$ if, and only if, it admits a
polynomial kernel for every value of $r$ (under the standard assumption of
parameterized complexity theory that $\mathrm{FPT} \neq W[2]$).

maps for operator-valued positive definite kernels. This is a generalization of
the random Fourier features for scalar-valued kernels to the operator-valued
case. Our general setting is that of operator-valued kernels corresponding to
RKHS of functions with values in a Hilbert space. We show that in general, for
a given kernel, there are potentially infinitely many random feature maps,
which can be bounded or unbounded. Most importantly, given a kernel, we present
a general, closed form formula for computing a corresponding probability
measure, which is required for the construction of the Fourier features, and
which, unlike the scalar case, is not uniquely and automatically determined by
the kernel. We also show that, under appropriate conditions, random bounded
feature maps can always be computed. Furthermore, we show the uniform
convergence, under the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, of the resulting approximate
kernel to the exact kernel on any compact subset of Euclidean space. Our
convergence requires differentiable kernels, an improvement over the
twice-differentiability requirement in previous work in the scalar setting. We
then show how operator-valued feature maps and their approximations can be
employed in a general vector-valued learning framework. The mathematical
formulation is illustrated by numerical examples on matrix-valued kernels.

customers' energy profile coupled with high number of customers, managing
energy transactions and resulting energy exchanges are challenging for a PPS.
The envisioned PPS maintains several aggregators (e.g. Microgrids), named as
Sub Service Provider (SSP) that manage customers/subscribers under their
domains. The SSPs act as agents that perform local energy matching (inside
their domains) and distributed energy matching within SSPs to determine the
energy commitment. The goal of the distributed energy matching is to reduce the
involvement of External Energy Supplier (e.g. Utility) while providing a
platform to demand side players to be a part of energy transaction. A
distributed assignment problem is designed that requires minimum and aggregated
information exchange (hence, secured) and solved by Linear Programming (LP)
that provides the distributed matching decision. The communicative burden among
SSPs due to the exchange of energy information is reduced by applying an
adaptive coalition formation method. The simulations are conducted by
implementing a synchronous distributed matching algorithm while showing the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

conditions. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms of
self-organized pattern formation and scaling.
  First, we explore the basic principles and challenges of pattern scaling in
mechanisms previously proposed to describe biological pattern formation. Next,
we present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely
self-organized and self-scaling patterns. This framework captures essential
features of body plan regeneration and scaling in flatworms. Further, we
analyze shape and motility of flatworms. By applying principal component
analysis, we characterize shape dynamics during different motility modes and
also identify shape variations between different flatworm species. Finally, we
investigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We identify
three mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof
can explain the measured organism growth by rules on the cellular scale.
  In a close collaboration with experimental biologists, we combine minimal
theoretical descriptions with state-of-the-art experiments and data analysis.
This allows us to identify generic principles of scalable body plan patterning
and growth control in flatworms.

dynamic system based on the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations with
regard to Friedman Universe has a stable center corresponding to zero values of
scalar potential and its derivative at infinity. Thus, the cosmological model
based on single massive classical scalar field in infinite future would give a
flat Universe. The carried out numerical simulation of the dynamic system
corresponding to the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations showed that
at great times of the evolution the invariant cosmological acceleration has a
microscopic oscillating character ($T\sim 2\pi mt$), while macroscopic value of
the cosmological acceleration varies from $+1$ at inflation stage after which
if decreases fast to $-1/2$ (non-relativistic stage), and then slowly tends to
$-1$ (ultrarelativistic stage).

  Ankara Turkey",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most people do not know how much energy they are spending for different
purposes and also they are unaware of potential electrical consumption
reduction level they could make by changing their consumption behaviors or
investing in new efficient technology products. Providing electrical
consumption information to household and make the consumption information
tangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in
households. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on
electrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy
turning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is
possible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in
order to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the
knowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.
Monitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption
and comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.
Households received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral
change associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It
is also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption
display have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in
households. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,
house 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that
further attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying
different type of monitor designs and implication of special designed
stimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with
their current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time
periods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for
specific consumption behaviors.
