fragility of metallic glasses in relation to their atomic-level structure and
the effective interatomic interaction. The bottom-up approach starts with
forming an effective Ashcroft-Born-Mayer interatomic potential based on
Boltzmann inversion of the radial distribution function g(r) and on fitting the
short-range part of $g(r)$ by means of a simple power-law approximation. The
power exponent $\lambda$ represents a global repulsion steepness parameter. A
scaling relation between atomic connectivity and packing fraction $Z \sim
\phi^{1+\lambda}$ is derived. This relation is then implemented in a
lattice-dynamical model for the high-frequency shear modulus where the
attractive anharmonic part of the effective interaction is taken into account
through the thermal expansion coefficient which maps the $\phi$-dependence into
a $T$-dependence. The shear modulus as a function of temperature calculated in
this way is then used within the cooperative shear model of the glass
transition to yield the viscosity of the supercooled melt as a
double-exponential function of $T$ across the entire Angell plot. The model,
which has only one adjustable parameter (the characteristic atomic volume for
high-frequency cage deformation) is tested against new experimental data of
ZrCu alloys and provides an excellent one-parameter description of the
viscosity down to the glass transition temperature.

antiferromagnetic disorder (randomness) are calculated using first principles
non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we examine the
validity of universal scaling relations that are related to these three studied
physical quantities. These relations are relevant to experimental data and are
firmly established for clean (regular) 3D dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg models.
Remarkably, our numerical results show that the considered scaling relations
remain true for the investigated model with the introduced disorder. In
addition, while the presence of disorder may change the physical properties of
regular dimerized models, hence leading to different critical theories, both
the obtained data of N\'eel temperature and staggered magnetization density in
our study are fully compatible with the expected critical behaviour for clean
dimerized systems. As a result, it is persuasive to conclude that the related
quantum phase transitions of the considered disordered model and its clean
counterparts are governed by the same critical theory, which is not always the
case in general. Finally, we also find smooth scalings even emerging when both
the data of the investigated disordered model as well as its associated clean
system are taken into account. This in turn implies that, while in a restricted
sense, the considered scaling relations for 3D spin-1/2 antiferromagnets are
indeed universal.

Volatiles are emitted by volcanism and, in particular, from mid-ocean ridges,
which are the most prolific source of basaltic volcanism. Estimates of volatile
extraction from the asthenosphere beneath ridges typically rely on measurements
of undegassed lavas combined with simple petrogenetic models of the mean degree
of melting. Estimated volatile fluxes have large uncertainties; this is partly
due to a poor understanding of how volatiles are transported by magma in the
asthenosphere. Here, we assess the fate of mantle volatiles through numerical
simulations of melting and melt transport at mid-ocean ridges. Our simulations
are based on two-phase, magma/mantle dynamics theory coupled to idealised
thermodynamic model of mantle melting in the presence of water and carbon
dioxide. We combine simulation results with catalogued observations of all
ridge segments to estimate a range of likely volatile output from the global
mid-ocean ridge system. We thus predict global MOR crust production of 66-73
Gt/yr (22-24 km3/yr) and global volatile output of 52-110 Mt/yr, corresponding
to mantle volatile contents of 100--200~ppm. We find that volatile extraction
is limited: up to half of deep, volatile-rich melt is not focused to the axis
but is rather deposited along the LAB. As these distal melts crystallise and
fractionate, they metasomatise the base of the lithosphere, creating
rheological heterogeneity that could contribute to the seismic signature of the
LAB.

image values are precise. However, due to the scale of such systems, they can
be mechanically unstable, causing the imaging array to wobble during a scan.
This leads to an effective loss of precision in the captured image. We consider
the measurement of wobble and amelioration of the consequent loss of image
precision. Following our previous work, we use Beam Position Detectors (BPDs)
to measure the cross-sectional profile of the X-ray beam, allowing for
estimation, and thus correction of wobble. We propose: (i) a model of image
formation with a wobbling detector array; (ii) a method of wobble correction
derived from this model; (iii) methods for calibrating sensor sensitivities and
relative offsets; (iv) a Random Regression Forest based method for
instantaneous estimation of detector wobble, and (v) using these estimates to
apply corrections to captured images of difficult scenes. We show that these
methods are able to correct for $87\%$ of image error due wobble, and when
applied to difficult images, a significant visible improvement in the
intensity-windowed image quality is observed. The method improves the precision

asymmetries generated by the main-belt asteroids (MBAs) as well as the
near-Earth objects (NEOs).
  Based on a planar model that excludes the terrestrial and lunar gravitations
on the impactors and assuming the impactor encounter speed with Earth
$v_{\rm{enc}}$ is higher than the lunar orbital speed $v_{\rm{M}}$, we
rigorously integrated the lunar cratering distribution, and derived its
approximation to the first order of $v_{\rm{M}}/v_{\rm{enc}}$. Numerical
simulations of lunar bombardment by the MBAs during the late heavy bombardment
were performed with an Earth-Moon distance $a_{\rm{M}}$ = 20--60 Earth radii in
five cases.
  The analytical model directly proves the existence of a leading/trailing
asymmetry and the absence of near/far asymmetry. The approximate form of the
leading/trailing asymmetry is $(1 + A_1 \cos\beta)$, which decreases as the
apex distance $\beta$ increases. The numerical simulations show evidence of a
pole/equator asymmetry as well as the leading/trailing asymmetry, and the
former is empirically described as $(1 + A_2 \cos2\varphi)$, which decreases as
the latitude modulus $|\varphi|$ increases. The amplitudes $A_{1,2}$ are
reliable measurements of asymmetries. Our analysis explicitly indicates the
quantitative relations between cratering distribution and bombardment
conditions (impactor properties and the lunar orbital status) like $A_1 \propto
v_{\rm{M}}/v_{\rm{enc}}$, resulting in a method for reproducing the bombardment
conditions through measuring the asymmetry. Mutual confirmation between
analytical model and numerical simulations is found in terms of the cratering
distribution and its variation with $a_{\rm{M}}$. Estimates of $A_1$ for crater
density distributions generated by the MBAs and the NEOs are 0.101--0.159 and
0.117, respectively.

spontaneous emission, which limits the observation of many-body effects,
motivating research into potential alternatives. Here we demonstrate that SOC
can be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional fermionic 87Sr
optical lattice clock (OLC). In contrast to previous SOC experiments, in this
work the SOC is both generated and probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical
clock transition between two electronic orbital states. We use clock
spectroscopy to prepare lattice band populations, internal electronic states,
and quasimomenta, as well as to produce SOC dynamics. The exceptionally long
lifetime of the excited clock state (160 s) eliminates decoherence and atom
loss from spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales,
allowing subsequent momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band
structure and eigenstates. We utilize these capabilities to study Bloch
oscillations, spin-momentum locking, and Van Hove singularities in the
transition density of states. Our results lay the groundwork for the use of
OLCs to probe novel SOC phases of matter.

building energy simulations that are needed to make effective energy-saving
policies. These properties are usually investigated through in-situ
measurements of temperature and heat flux over extended time periods. The
one-dimensional heat equation with unknown Dirichlet boundary conditions is
used to model the heat transfer process through the wall. In [F. Ruggeri, Z.
Sawlan, M. Scavino, R. Tempone, A hierarchical Bayesian setting for an inverse
problem in linear parabolic PDEs with noisy boundary conditions, Bayesian
Analysis 12 (2) (2017) 407--433], it was assessed the uncertainty about the
thermal diffusivity parameter using different synthetic data sets. In this
work, we adapt this methodology to an experimental study conducted in an
environmental chamber, with measurements recorded every minute from temperature
probes and heat flux sensors placed on both sides of a solid brick wall over a
five-day period. The observed time series are locally averaged, according to a
smoothing procedure determined by the solution of a criterion function
optimization problem, to fit the required set of noise model assumptions.
Therefore, after preprocessing, we can reasonably assume that the temperature
and the heat flux measurements have stationary Gaussian noise and we can avoid
working with full covariance matrices. The results show that our technique
reduces the bias error of the estimated parameters when compared to other
approaches. Finally, we compute the information gain under two experimental
setups to recommend how the user can efficiently determine the duration of the
measurement campaign and the range of the external temperature oscillation.

the number field sieve, Pomerance in 1994 posed the following problem: how
large should $N$ be so that, with high probability, this sequence contains a
subsequence, the product of whose elements is a perfect square? Pomerance
determined asymptotically the logarithm of the threshold for this event, and
conjectured that it in fact exhibits a sharp threshold in $N$. More recently,
Croot, Granville, Pemantle and Tetali determined the threshold up to a factor
of $4/\pi + o(1)$ as $x \to \infty$, and made a conjecture regarding the
location of the sharp threshold.
  In this paper we prove both of these conjectures, by determining the sharp

probability and analytic number theory; in particular, we use the so-called

computationally challenging because they involve minimizing over functions of
quantities (i.e. Wasserstein distances) that themselves require numerical
algorithms to compute. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach based
on simulated annealing for solving WLMs. Particularly, we have developed a
Gibbs sampler to approximate effectively and efficiently the partial gradients
of a sequence of Wasserstein losses. Our new approach has the advantages of
numerical stability and readiness for warm starts. These characteristics are
valuable for WLM problems that often require multiple levels of iterations in
which the oracle for computing the value and gradient of a loss function is
embedded. We applied the method to optimal transport with Coulomb cost and the
Wasserstein non-negative matrix factorization problem, and made comparisons
with the existing method of entropy regularization.

framework to study the stability of graph partitioning methods, which we call
structural consistency. Both stability under perturbation as well as asymptotic
consistency (i.e., convergence with probability $1$ as the sample size goes to
infinity under a fixed probability model) follow from our notion of structural
consistency. By formulating structural consistency as a continuity result on
the graphon space, we obtain robust results that are completely independent of
the data generating mechanism. In particular, our results apply in settings
where observations are not independent, thereby significantly generalizing the
common probabilistic approach where data are assumed to be i.i.d.
  In order to make precise the notion of structural consistency of graph
partitioning, we begin by extending the theory of graph limits to include
vertex colored graphons. We then define continuous node-level statistics and
prove that graph partitioning based on such statistics is consistent. Finally,
we derive the structural consistency of commonly used clustering algorithms in
a general model-free setting. These include clustering based on local graph
statistics such as homomorphism densities, as well as the popular spectral
clustering using the normalized Laplacian.
  We posit that proving the continuity of clustering algorithms in the graph
limit topology can stand on its own as a more robust form of model-free
consistency. We also believe that the mathematical framework developed in this
paper goes beyond the study of clustering algorithms, and will guide the
development of similar model-free frameworks to analyze other procedures in the
broader mathematical sciences.

granular data of residential electricity consumption available on a large

customers and utilities. One field of research that relies on such granular
consumption data is Residential Demand Response, where individual users are
incentivized to temporarily reduce their consumption during periods of high
marginal cost of electricity. To quantify the economic potential of Residential
Demand Response, it is important to estimate the reductions during Demand
Response hours, taking into account the heterogeneity of electricity users. In
this paper, we incorporate latent variables representing behavioral archetypes
of electricity users into the process of short term load forecasting with
Machine Learning methods, thereby differentiating between varying levels of
energy consumption. The latent variables are constructed by fitting Conditional
Mixture Models of Linear Regressions and Hidden Markov Models on smart meter
readings of a Residential Demand Response program in the western United States.
We observe a notable increase in the accuracy of short term load forecasts
compared to the case without latent variables. We then estimate the reductions
during Demand Response events conditional on the latent variables, and discover
a higher DR reduction among users with automated smart home devices compared to
those without.

number of energy-harvesting (EH) sensors and computing the optimal power
allocation. The ultimate goal is to minimize the reconstruction distortion at
the fusion center. This optimization problem is, unfortunately, non-convex. To
circumvent that, we propose two suboptimal strategies: (i) a joint sensor
selection and power allocation (JSS-EH) scheme that, we prove, is capable of
iteratively finding a stationary solution of the original problem from a
sequence of surrogate convex problems; and (ii) a separate sensor selection and
power allocation (SS-EH) scheme, on which basis we can identify a sensible
sensor selection and analytically find a power allocation policy by solving a
convex problem. We also discuss the interplay between the two strategies.
Performance in terms of reconstruction distortion, impact of initialization,
actual subsets of selected sensors and computed power allocation policies,
etc., is assessed by means of computer simulations. To that aim, an EH-agnostic
sensor selection strategy, a lower bound on distortion, and an online version
of the SS-EH and JSS-EH schemes are derived and used for benchmarking.

balls of increasing size. This leads to a phase-transition that depends on the
ergodic properties of the underlying nonsingular action of the free group but
is different from what happens in the case of S$\alpha$S random fields indexed
by $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The presence of this new dichotomy is confirmed by the study
of a stable random field induced by the canonical action of the free group on
its Furstenberg-Poisson boundary with the measure being Patterson-Sullivan.
This field is generated by a conservative action but its maxima sequence grows
as fast as the i.i.d. case contrary to what happens in the case of
$\mathbb{Z}^d$. When the action of the free group is dissipative, we also
establish that the scaled extremal point process sequence converges weakly to a
novel class of point processes that we have termed as randomly thinned cluster
Poisson processes. This limit too is very different from that in the case of a

by supernovae (SNe) and accumulate over time into the deep gravitational
potential well of clusters of galaxies. Since most of the elements visible in
X-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,
measuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis
products of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).
In this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios
(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44
galaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical
enrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models
found in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured
standard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our
abundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly
underestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced
better, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the
observations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from
the Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot
ICM. On the other hand, the Ni/Fe ratio can be reproduced better by assuming
that both deflagration and delayed-detonation SNIa contribute in similar
proportions to the ICM enrichment. In either case, the fraction of SNIa over
the total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges
within 29-45%. This fraction is found to be systematically higher than the
corresponding SNIa/SNe fraction contributing to the enrichment of the
proto-solar environnement (15-25%). We also discuss and quantify two useful
constraints on both SNIa and SNcc that can be inferred from the ICM abundance
ratios.

them as a convenient platform for exploring phase transitions and developing
energy-efficient switching devices. However, the fundamental question of how
ferroic domains switch, i.e. how the polarization changes from one state to
another, is yet to be answered fully. There are contradicting models and a wide
body of accumulated data which disagree as to whether the switching requires
domain nucleation. Moreover, ferroelectric domains switch under electric fields
that are supposedly too weak to form nucleation sites, indicating that the
level of disorder seen in real systems plays an important role. This
longstanding so-called Landauer's paradox is the ferroelectric equivalent to
the absence of raindrop formation in a dust-free vacuum, leading to
supersaturated vapors that cannot exist otherwise, e.g. in spinodal
decompositions or inhomogeneous nucleation environments. Here we show that
polarization switching in ferroelectric-ferroelastic systems comprises domain
types that differ by symmetry, lengthscale and switching energy. These domains
switch simultaneously thanks to intermediate-range order of organized pinning
sites, supporting the previously-unexplained coexistence of
nucleation-and-growth and nucleation-frustrated mechanisms. Our treatment is
applicable to other Kolmogorov-Avrami systems with multi-scale phase
transitions. Finally, we demonstrate augmented electromechanical coupling based
on the collective motion of pinning sites, which is promising for nano
electro-mechanical and low-power switching devices.

could have been kept warm by global cirrus cloud decks in a CO2-H2O atmosphere
containing at least 0.25 bar of CO2 (Urata and Toon, 2013). Initial warming
from some other process, e.g., impacts, would be required to make this model
work. Those results were generated using the CAM 3-D global climate model.
Here, we use a single-column radiative-convective climate model to further
investigate the cirrus cloud warming hypothesis. Our calculations indicate that
cirrus cloud decks could have produced global mean surface temperatures above
freezing, but only if cirrus cloud cover approaches ~75 - 100% and if other
cloud properties (e.g., height, optical depth, particle size) are chosen
favorably. However, at more realistic cirrus cloud fractions, or if cloud
parameters are not optimal, cirrus clouds do not provide the necessary warming,

supernova and dictate the appearance of the resulting explosion. To study how
mass-loss rates change with evolution we measure the mass-loss rates (\mdot)
and extinctions of 19 red supergiants in the young massive cluster NGC2100 in
the Large Magellanic Cloud. By targeting stars in a coeval cluster we can study
the mass-loss rate evolution whilst keeping the variables of mass and
metallicity fixed. Mass-loss rates were determined by fitting DUSTY models to
mid-IR photometry from WISE and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the \mdot\ in red
supergiants increases as the star evolves, and is well described by \mdot\
prescription of de Jager, used widely in stellar evolution calculations. We
find the extinction caused by the warm dust is negligible, meaning the warm
circumstellar material of the inner wind cannot explain the higher levels of
extinction found in the RSGs compared to other cluster stars. We discuss the
implications of this work in terms of supernova progenitors and stellar
evolution theory. We argue there is little justification for substantially
increasing the \mdot\ during the RSG phase, as has been suggested recently in
order to explain the absence of high mass Type IIP supernova progenitors. We
also argue that an increase in reddening towards the end of the RSG phase, as
observed for the two most evolved cluster stars, may provide a solution to the
red supergiant problem.

medium can lead to biases in the estimates of key cluster parameters if
composition gradients are present. The helium concentration profile in galaxy
clusters is unfortunately not directly observable. Current models addressing
the putative sedimentation are one-dimensional and parametrize the presence of
magnetic fields in a crude way, ignoring the weakly-collisional, magnetized
nature of the medium. When these effects are considered, a wide variety of
instabilities can play an important role in the plasma dynamics. In a series of
recent papers, we have developed the local, linear theory of these
instabilities and addressed their non-linear development with a modified
version of Athena. Here, we extend our study by developing a quasi-global
approach that we use to simulate the mixing of helium as induced by
generalizations of the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the
magneto-thermal instability (MTI), which feed off thermal and composition
gradients. In the inner region of the ICM, mixing can occur on few Gyrs, after
which the average magnetic field inclination angle is $\sim 45^{\circ}$
resulting in an averaged Spitzer parameter higher by about 20 % than the value
obtained in homogeneous simulations. In the cluster outskirts the instabilities
are rather inefficient, due to the shallow gradients. This suggests that
compositions gradients in cluster cores might be shallower than one-dimensional
models predict. More quantitative statements demand more refined models that
can incorporate the physics driving the sedimentation process and
simultaneously account for the weakly-collisional nature of the plasma.

suggest that SmB$_6$ may be the first topological Kondo insulator (TKI) and
propose that the residual conductivity is due to topological surface states

the description of transversely isotropic materials such as shale rock, foams,
unidirectional composites, and ceramics. Two possible approaches are
considered: 1) the spectral decomposition of the stiffness tensor to define the
microplane constitutive laws in terms of energetically orthogonal eigenstrains
and eigenstresses; and 2) the definition of orientation-dependent microplane
elastic moduli. It is shown that the first approach provides a rigorous way to
tackle anisotropy within the microplane framework whereas the second approach
represents an approximation which, however, makes the formulation of nonlinear
constitutive equations much simpler. The efficacy of the second approach in
modeling the macroscopic elastic behavior is compared to the thermodynamic
restrictions of the anisotropic parameters showing that a significant range of
elastic properties can be modeled with excellent accuracy. Further, it is shown
that it provides a very good approximation of the microplane stresses provided
by the first approach, with the advantage of a simpler formulation.
  It is concluded that the spectral stiffness decomposition represents the best
approach in such cases as for modeling unidirectional composites, in which
accurately capturing the elastic behavior is important. The introduction of
orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli provides a simpler framework
for the modeling of transversely isotropic materials with remarked inelastic
behavior, as in the case, for example, of shale rock.

the energy transfer and dissipation in the atmosphere. We performed
simultaneous Hinode and IRIS observations of a sunspot umbra to derive the
upward energy fluxes at two different atmospheric layers (photosphere and lower
transition region) and estimate the energy dissipation. The observations
revealed some properties of the observed periodic oscillations in physical
quantities, such as their phase relations, temporal behaviors, and power
spectra, making a conclusion that standing slow-mode waves are dominant at the
photosphere with their high-frequency leakage, which is observed as upward
waves at the chromosphere and the lower transition region. Our estimates of
upward energy fluxes are $2.0\times10^7$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the
photospheric level and $8.3\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the lower

than the energy required to maintain the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae,
suggesting that the observed waves can make a crucial contribution to the
heating of the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae. In contrast, the upward
energy flux derived at the lower transition region level is smaller than the
energy flux required for heating the corona, implying that we may need another
heating mechanism. We should, however, note a possibility that the energy
dissipated at the chromosphere might be overestimated because of the opacity
effect.

($P=19.23$ d) binary system KIC 9777062 that contains main sequence stars near
the turnoff of the intermediate age open cluster NGC 6811. The primary is a
metal-lined Am star with a possible convective blueshift to its radial
velocities, and one star (probably the secondary) is likely to be a $\gamma$
Dor pulsator. The component masses are $1.603\pm0.006$(stat.)$\pm0.016$(sys.)
and $1.419\pm0.003\pm0.008 M_\odot$, and the radii are $1.744\pm0.004\pm0.002$

inconsistent: the age from the mass-radius combination for the primary
($1.05\pm0.05\pm0.09$ Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from
models and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary
($1.21\pm0.05\pm0.15$ Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the
color-magnitude diagram ($1.00\pm0.05$ Gyr).
  We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters $\Delta
\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$ for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of
the stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller)
than predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars.
  The majority of stars near the cluster turnoff are pulsating stars: we
identify a sample of 28 $\delta$ Sct, 15 $\gamma$ Dor, and 5 hybrid types. We
used the period-luminosity relation for high-amplitude $\delta$ Sct stars to
fit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding
$(m-M)_V = 10.37\pm0.03$. This is larger than most previous determinations, but
smaller than values derived from the eclipsing binary ($10.47\pm0.05$).

corrector top end to be purpose-built for the AAT. Many thousand fibres will
then be fed into new replicable spectrographs. Fundamentally new science will
be achieved compared to existing instruments due to Hector's wider field of
view (3 degrees), high positioning efficiency using starbugs, higher
spectroscopic resolution (R~3000-5500 from 3727-7761A, with a possible redder

  methods for linearly constrained convex programming","Accepted in SIAM Journal on Optimization",,,,"math.OC math.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of block coordinate update
(BCU) methods, which are particularly suitable for problems involving
large-sized data and/or variables. In optimization, BCU first appears as the
coordinate descent method that works well for smooth problems or those with
separable nonsmooth terms and/or separable constraints. As nonseparable
constraints exist, BCU can be applied under primal-dual settings.
  In the literature, it has been shown that for weakly convex problems with
nonseparable linear constraint, BCU with fully Gauss-Seidel updating rule may
fail to converge and that with fully Jacobian rule can converge sublinearly.
However, empirically the method with Jacobian update is usually slower than
that with Gauss-Seidel rule. To maintain their advantages, we propose a hybrid
Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel BCU method for solving linearly constrained
multi-block structured convex programming, where the objective may have a
nonseparable quadratic term and separable nonsmooth terms. At each primal block
variable update, the method approximates the augmented Lagrangian function at
an affine combination of the previous two iterates, and the affinely mixing
matrix with desired nice properties can be chosen through solving a
semidefinite programming. We show that the hybrid method enjoys the theoretical
convergence guarantee as Jacobian BCU. In addition, we numerically demonstrate
that the method can perform as well as Gauss-Seidel method and better than a
recently proposed randomized primal-dual BCU method.

can make a probe of turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and their host
galaxies. To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter
broadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density
fluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a
short-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly
supersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of
shock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the
required density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the
scattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with
efficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling
of the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies
in different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the
major origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the
total DM. We also find that the sheet-like structure of density in the host ISM
associated with folded magnetic fields in a viscosity-dominated regime of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot give rise to strong scattering.
Furthermore, valuable insights into the IGM turbulence concerning the detailed
spatial structure of density and magnetic field can be gained from the observed
scattering timescale of FRBs. Our results are in favor of the suppression of
micro-plasma instabilities and the validity of collisional-MHD description of
turbulence properties in the collisionless IGM.

depth sensors, i.e., accessible human pose prediction from still depth images
[32]. However, most of the existing approaches to this problem involve several
components/models that are independently designed and optimized, leading to
suboptimal performances. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-embedded
multi-task learning framework for predicting human pose from still depth
images, which is implemented with a deep architecture of neural networks.
Specifically, we handle two cascaded tasks: i) generating the heat (confidence)
maps of body parts via a fully convolutional network (FCN); ii) seeking the
optimal configuration of body parts based on the detected body part proposals
via an inference built-in MatchNet [10], which measures the appearance and
geometric kinematic compatibility of body parts and embodies the dynamic
programming inference as an extra network layer. These two tasks are jointly
optimized. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed deep model
significantly improves the accuracy of human pose estimation over other several
state-of-the-art methods or SDKs. We also release a large-scale dataset for
comparison, which includes 100K depth images under challenging scenarios.

dynamic regret, which measures the performance of an online learner against a
sequence of local minimizers. By exploiting the strong convexity, previous
studies have shown that the dynamic regret can be upper bounded by the
path-length of the comparator sequence. In this paper, we illustrate that the
dynamic regret can be further improved by allowing the learner to query the
gradient of the function multiple times, and meanwhile the strong convexity can
be weakened to other non-degenerate conditions. Specifically, we introduce the
squared path-length, which could be much smaller than the path-length, as a new
regularity of the comparator sequence. When multiple gradients are accessible
to the learner, we first demonstrate that the dynamic regret of strongly convex
functions can be upper bounded by the minimum of the path-length and the
squared path-length. We then extend our theoretical guarantee to functions that
are semi-strongly convex or self-concordant. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first time that semi-strong convexity and self-concordance are utilized
to tighten the dynamic regret.

growth of bond percolation clusters are subjected to an Achlioptas type
selection process, i.e., whether a bond will be placed or not depends on the
sizes of clusters it may potentially connect. Different than the standard
percolation where the growth of discrete clusters are completely random,
clusters in this case grow in correlation with one another. We show that
certain values of correlation strength, if chosen in a way to suppress the
growth of the largest cluster which actually results in an explosive growth
later on, may lead to more efficient transports than in the case of standard
percolation, satisfied that certain fraction of total possible bonds are
present in the lattice. In this case transport efficiency increases as a power
function of bond fraction in the vicinity of where effective transport begins.
It turns out that the higher correlation strengths may also reduce the
efficiency as well. We also compare our results with those of the incoherent
transport and examine the average spreading of eigenstates for different bond
fractions. In this way, we demonstrate that structural differences of discrete
clusters due to different correlations result in different localization
properties.

When integrated over time, these estimations are called quality adjusted life
years (QALYs). Until now, characterizing health utilities (HUs) required
detailed patient interviews or written surveys. While reliable and specific,
this data remained costly due to efforts to locate, enlist and coordinate
participants. Thus the scope, context and temporality of diseases examined has
remained limited.
  Now that more than a billion people use social media, we propose a novel
strategy: use natural language processing to analyze public online
conversations for signals of the severity of medical conditions and correlate
these to known HUs using machine learning. In this work, we filter a dataset
that originally contained 2 billion tweets for relevant content on 60 diseases.
Using this data, our algorithm successfully distinguished mild from severe
diseases, which had previously been categorized only by traditional techniques.
This represents progress towards two related applications: first, predicting
HUs where such information is nonexistent; and second, (where rich HU data
already exists) estimating temporal or geographic patterns of disease severity
through data mining.

$\mu$s to 2 ms. When the magnetic field is aligned in a direction such that
spin-orbit coupling cannot cause spin flips, the correlation spectrum has
prominent peaks centered at zero frequency and at the differences of the Larmor
frequencies of the nuclei, on top of a frequency-independent background. When
the spin-orbit field is relevant, there are additional peaks, centered at the
frequencies of the individual species. A theoretical model which neglects the
effects of high-frequency charge noise correctly predicts the positions of the
observed peaks, and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the size of the
frequency-independent background, but gives peak areas that are larger than the
observed areas by a factor of two or more. The observed peak widths are roughly
consistent with predictions based on nuclear dephasing times of the order of 60

two distinct patterns of RH$\nu$ masses, one hierarchical and another not so

RH$\nu$ masses. The triplet fermionic dark matter at the TeV scale carrying
even matter parity is naturally embedded into the non-standard fermionic
representation ${45}_F$ of SO(10). In addition to the triplet scalar and the
triplet fermion, the model needs a nonstandard color octet fermion of mass
$\sim 10^7$ GeV to achieve precision gauge coupling unification. Threshold
corrections due to superheavy components of ${126}_H$ and other representations
are estimated and found to be substantial. It is noted that the proton life
time predicted by the model is accessible to the ongoing and planned
experiments over a wide range of parameter space.

1425 Fermi blazars to calculate their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). A
parabolic function, $\log(\nu F_{\nu}) = P_1(\log\nu - P_2)^2 + P_3,$ is used
for SED fitting. Synchrotron peak frequency ($\log \nu_p$), spectral curvature
($P_1$), peak flux ($\nu_{\rm p}F_{\rm \nu_p}$), and integrated flux ($\nu
F_{\nu}$) are successfully obtained for 1392 blazars (461 flat spectrum radio
quasars-FSRQs, 620 BL Lacs-BLs and 311 blazars of uncertain type-BCUs, 999
sources have known redshifts). Monochromatic luminosity at radio 1.4 GHz,
optical R band, X-ray at 1 keV and $\gamma$-ray at 1 GeV, peak luminosity,
integrated luminosity and effective spectral indexes of radio to optical
($\alpha_{\rm RO}$), and optical to X-ray ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) are calculated.
The ""Bayesian classification"" is employed to log$\nu_{\rm p}$ in the rest frame
for 999 blazars with available redshift and the results show that 3 components
are enough to fit the $\log\nu_{\rm p}$ distribution, there is no ultra high
peaked subclass. Based on the 3 components, the subclasses of blazars using the
acronyms of Abdo et al. (2010a) are classified, and some mutual correlations
are also studied. Conclusions are finally drawn as follows: (1) SEDs are
successfully obtained for 1392 blazars. The fitted peak frequencies are
compared with common sources from samples available (Sambruna et al. 1996,
Nieppola et al. 2006, 2008, Abdo et al. 2010a). (2) Blazars are classified as
low synchrotron peak sources (LSPs) if $\log\nu_{\rm p}$(Hz) $\leq 14.0$,
intermediate synchrotron peak sources (ISPs) if $14.0 < \log\nu_{\rm p}$(Hz)
$\leq 15.3$, and high synchrotron peak sources (HSPs) if $\log\nu_{\rm p}$(Hz)
$> 15.3$. (3) $\gamma$-ray emissions are strongly correlated with radio
emissions. (...)

substantially reduce electronic hopping, while simultaneously sustaining

attracting considerable attentions due to its favorable denoising performance.
In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction of
feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace the
progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularization
method into image denoising. Specifically, residual learning and batch
normalization are utilized to speed up the training process as well as boost
the denoising performance. Different from the existing discriminative denoising
models which usually train a specific model for additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) at a certain noise level, our DnCNN model is able to handle Gaussian
denoising with unknown noise level (i.e., blind Gaussian denoising). With the
residual learning strategy, DnCNN implicitly removes the latent clean image in
the hidden layers. This property motivates us to train a single DnCNN model to
tackle with several general image denoising tasks such as Gaussian denoising,
single image super-resolution and JPEG image deblocking. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that our DnCNN model can not only exhibit high
effectiveness in several general image denoising tasks, but also be efficiently
implemented by benefiting from GPU computing.

way to mitigate this issue is to establish a reliable performance model that

and Niesen as a solution to reduce the network burden in peak times in a

corresponding placement delivery array, and proposed two new schemes from this
perspective. These schemes above significantly reduce the transmission rate
$R$, compared with the uncoded caching scheme. However, to implement the new
schemes, each file should be cut into $F$ pieces, where $F$ increases
exponentially with the number of users $K$. Such constraint is obviously
infeasible in the practical setting, especially when $K$ is large. Thus it is
desirable to design caching schemes with constant rate $R$ (independent of $K$)
as well as small $F$.
  In this paper we view the centralized coded caching problem in a hypergraph
perspective and show that designing a feasible placement delivery array is
equivalent to constructing a linear and (6, 3)-free 3-uniform 3-partite
hypergraph. Several new results and constructions arise from our novel point of
view. First, by using the famous (6, 3)-theorem in extremal combinatorics, we
show that constant rate caching schemes with $F$ growing linearly with $K$ do
not exist. Second, we present two infinite classes of centralized coded caching
schemes, which include the schemes of Ali-Niesen and Yan et al. as special
cases, respectively. Moreover, our constructions show that constant rate
caching schemes with $F$ growing sub-exponentially with $K$ do exist.

key components of our approach involve inverse modeling to infer the spatial

discrepancy information from a large number of inverse problems into corrective
model forms. We apply the methodology to turbulent flows over airfoils
involving flow separation. Model augmentations are developed for the Spalart
Allmaras (SA) model using adjoint-based full field inference on experimentally
measured lift coefficient data. When these model forms are reconstructed using
neural networks (NN) and embedded within a standard solver, we show that much
improved predictions in lift can be obtained for geometries and flow conditions
that were not used to train the model. The NN-augmented SA model also predicts
surface pressures extremely well. Portability of this approach is demonstrated
by confirming that predictive improvements are preserved when the augmentation
is embedded in a different commercial finite-element solver. The broader vision
is that by incorporating data that can reveal the form of the innate model
discrepancy, the applicability of data-driven turbulence models can be extended
to more general flows.

regions with and without multistationarity. A particular strength of the
procedure is the avoidance of numerical analysis and parameter sampling.
  The procedure consists of a number of steps. Each of these steps might be

context. In particular, we address the question of the complexity of validity
in modal dependence logic. By showing that it is NEXPTIME-complete we refute an
earlier conjecture proposing a higher complexity for the problem.

  with cyclic structures","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the important nonclassical effects in quantum optics is the
anti-bunching, which has been observed in a large class of physical systems -
including light-harvesting antennas with cyclic structures. The units of the
ring couple with adjacent ones through dipole-dipole interactions. We show how
this strong dipole-dipole interaction leads to photon-blockade resulting in the
suppression of double excitation pathway and anti-bunching in photosynthesis
systems. The robustness of the photon blockade is demonstrated against the
disorder in the ring structures. We hypothesis that the effect may be utilized
by light-harvesting systems to avoid damages from excess energy.

  Computers",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CT images are widely used in pathology detection and follow-up treatment
procedures. Accurate identification of pathological features requires
diagnostic quality CT images with minimal noise and artifact variation. In this
work, a novel Fourier-transform based metric for image quality (IQ) estimation
is presented that correlates to additive CT image noise. In the proposed
method, two windowed CT image subset regions are analyzed together to identify
the extent of variation in the corresponding Fourier-domain spectrum. The two
square windows are chosen such that their center pixels coincide and one window
is a subset of the other. The Fourier-domain spectral difference between these
two sub-sampled windows is then used to isolate spatial regions-of-interest
(ROI) with low signal variation (ROI-LV) and high signal variation (ROI-HV),
respectively. Finally, the spatial variance ($var$), standard deviation
($std$), coefficient of variance ($cov$) and the fraction of abdominal ROI
pixels in ROI-LV ($\nu'(q)$), are analyzed with respect to CT image noise. For
the phantom CT images, $var$ and $std$ correlate to CT image noise ($|r|>0.76$
($p\ll0.001$)), though not as well as $\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.96$ ($p\ll0.001$)).
However, for the combined phantom and patient CT images, $var$ and $std$ do not
correlate well with CT image noise ($|r|<0.46$ ($p\ll0.001$)) as compared to
$\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.95$ ($p\ll0.001$)). Thus, the proposed method and the metric,
$\nu'(q)$, can be useful to quantitatively estimate CT image noise.

accretion disks acquire rotation of polarization angle and orbital angular
momentum due to strong gravitational field in the vicinity of the rotating
black holes. Based on these two degrees of freedom we construct a bipartite
two-level quantum system of the accretion disk's photons. To characterize the
quantum states of this composite system we consider linear entropy for the
reduced density matrix of polarization with the intention to exploit its direct
relation with the photons degree of polarization. Accordingly, the minimum
degree of polarization of X-ray radiation located in the transition region of
the accretion disk indicates a high value of the linear entropy for the photons
emitted on this region, inferring a high degree of entanglement in the
composite system. We emphasize that for an extreme rotating black hole in the
thermal state, the photons with energies at the thermal peak are maximally
entangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum, leading to the creation
of all four Bell states. Detection and measurement of quantum information
encoded in photons emitted in the accretion disk around rotating black holes
may be performed by actual quantum information technology.

in the design of communications infrastructure. The radiation efficiency
$\eta_r$ impacts on the optimal gain, quality factor, and bandwidth. The
current efficiency limit applies to structures confined to a radian sphere $ka$
($k$ is the wave number, $a$ is the radius). Here we present new absolute
limits to $\eta_r$ for arbitrary antenna shapes based on $k^2S$ where $S$ is
the conductor surface area. For a dipole with an electrical length of $10^{-5}$
our result is four orders of magnitude closer to the analytical solution when
compared with previous bounds on the efficiency. The improved bound on $\eta_r$
is more accurate, more general, and easier to calculate than other limits. The
efficiency of an antenna cannot be larger than the case where the surface of
the antenna is 'peeled' off and assembled into a planar sheet with area $S$,
and a uniform current is excited along the surface of this sheet.

  Breakdown in MTJs and MOS Devices",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dielectric layers are gradually being down-scaled in different electronic
devices like MOSFETs and Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJ) with shrinking device
sizes. As a result, time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) has become a
major issue in such devices. In this paper we propose a generalized way of
modeling the stress induced leakage current (SILC) and post breakdown current
(PBC) due to time dependent wear-out of the dielectric layer. We model the
traps formed in dielectric layer using Buttiker probe and incorporate the
Buttiker probe self-energies in standard self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green
Function (NEGF) formalism in order to determine SILC and PBC. In addition, we
have shown the impact of break down in the dielectric layer on the spin current
and spin filtering characteristics of an MTJ. The proposed model is generic in
nature. It can be extended from MTJs and conventional CMOS technology to any
other devices with any type of single and multiple layers of dielectric
material(s).
