Variation Diminishing (LTVD) and remap routine, which enabled us to attain high
accuracy in capturing shocks and to handle the angular momentum distribution
correctly. Inviscid shock-free accretion disk solution produced a thick disk
structure, while the viscous shock-free solution attained a Bondi-like
structure, but in either case, no jet activity nor any QPO-like activity
developed. The steady state shocked solution in the inviscid, as well as, in
the viscous regime, matched theoretical predictions well. However, increasing
viscosity renders the accretion shock unstable. Large amplitude shock
oscillation is accompanied by intermittent, transient inner multiple shocks.
Such oscillation of the inner part of disk is interpreted as the source of QPO
in hard X-rays observed in micro-quasars. Strong shock oscillation induces
strong episodic jet emission. The jets also showed existence of shocks, which
are produced as one shell hits the preceding one. The periodicity of jets and
shock oscillation were similar. The jets for higher viscosity parameter are
evidently stronger and faster.

infrastructure would not result in cascading failures in the logical network.
Most of the prior approaches for survivable cross-layer network design aim at
single-link failure scenario, which are not applicable to the more challenging
multi-failure scenarios. Also, as many of these approaches use the cross-layer
cut concept, enumeration of all cuts in the network is required and thus
introducing exponential number of constraints. To overcome these difficulties,
we investigate in this paper survivable mapping approaches against multiple
physical link failures and its special case, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)

cross-layer spanning trees and cutsets to guarantee a survivable mapping when
multiple physical link failures occur. Based on the necessary and sufficient
conditions, we propose to solve the problem through (1) mixed-integer linear
programs which avoid enumerating all combinations of link failures, and (2) an
algorithm which generates/adds logical spanning trees sequentially. Our
simulation results show that the proposed approaches can produce survivable

the {\em unique determination of an affine connection} (i.e., without torsion
in the terminology of Cartan) and the question {\em which type of group}
characterizes physical space. The first feature came up in 1919 (commentaries
to Riemann's inaugural lecture) and played a crucial role in Weyl's work on the
PoS in the early 1920s. He defended the central role of affine connections even
in the light of Cartan's more general framework of connections with torsion. In
later years, after the rise of the Dirac field, it could have become
problematic, but Weyl saw the challenge posed to Einstein gravity by spin
coupling primarily in the possibility to allow for non-metric affine
connections. Only after Weyl's death Cartan's approach to infinitesimal
homogeneity and torsion became revitalized in gravity theories.

services due to their fast regulating characteristics. However, when EVs
participate in Supplementary Frequency Regulation (SFR), it is challenging to
simultaneously achieve the dispatch of the control center and the expected
State of Charge (SOC) levels of EV batteries. To solve this problem, in this
paper we propose a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) control strategy, in which an
uncertain dispatch is implemented in the control center without detailed EV
charging/discharging information. The regulation from the control center is
achieved by allocating the regulation task within the frequency regulation
capacity (FRC) of EVs. The expected SOC levels of EV batteries are guaranteed
by a real-time correction of their scheduled V2G power in EV charging stations.
Simulations on an interconnected two-area power system validate the
effectiveness of the proposed V2G control in achieving both the frequency
regulation and the expected SOC levels of EVs.

in the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ from SNe Ia data. The novelty of the approach
lies in the usage of information field theory, a statistical field theory that
is very well suited for the construction of optimal signal recovery algorithms.
The charm algorithm infers non-parametrically
$s(a)=\ln(\rho(a)/\rho_{\mathrm{crit}0})$, the density evolution which
determines $H(z)$, without assuming an analytical form of $\rho(a)$ but only
its smoothness with the scale factor $a=(1+z)^{-1}$. The inference problem of
recovering the signal $s(a)$ from the data is formulated in a fully Bayesian
way. In detail, we have rewritten the signal as the sum of a background
cosmology and a perturbation. This allows us to determine the maximum a
posteriory estimate of the signal by an iterative Wiener filter method.
Applying charm to the Union2.1 supernova compilation, we have recovered a
cosmic expansion history that is fully compatible with the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological expansion history with parameter values consistent
with the results of the Planck mission.

respect to both an analytical (sigmoid transfer function) and real-world

case, the method was found to identity the theoretically optimal region of
operation even in presence of noise. In the latter case, it was possible to
identify an amplifier circuit configuration providing a good compromise between
linearity, amplification and output resistance. The transistor amplifier
application, which was addressed in terms of transfer functions derived from
its experimentally obtained characteristic surface, also yielded contributions
such as the estimation of local constants of the device, as opposed to
typically considered average values. Moreover, the obtained characteristic
surfaces of the considered transistor (a generic, low signal device) revealed a
surprisingly complex structure. The reported method and results paves the way
to several other applications in other types of devices and systems,

controlled by both deterministic factors arising out of applied loads and
stochastic effects appearing due to fluctuations of internal stress. Such type
of stochastic dislocation processes and the associated spatially inhomogeneous
modes lead to randomness in the observed deformation structure. Previous
studies have analyzed the role of randomness in such textural evolution but
none of these models have considered the impact of a finite decay time (all
previous models assumed instantaneous relaxation which is ""unphysical"") of the
stochastic perturbations in the overall dynamics of the system. The present
article bridges this knowledge gap by introducing a colored noise in the form
of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise in the analysis of a class of linear and
nonlinear Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes that these structural
dislocation dynamics could be mapped on to. Based on an analysis of the
relevant Fokker-Planck model, our results show that linear Wiener processes
remain unaffected by the second time scale in the problem but all nonlinear
processes, both Wiener type and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type, scale as a function of
the noise decay time $\tau$. The results are expected to ramify existing
experimental observations and inspire new numerical and laboratory tests to
gain further insight into the competition between deterministic and random

Ricci tensor and Einstein tensor are functions of connection field. As a
result, the connection field gives rise to relation, $h_{\mu\nu} = f
g_{\mu\nu}$ between effective metric, $h_{\mu\nu}$ and the usual metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$ where $f \,=\,1 - \kappa{\phi}^{,\alpha}{\phi}_{,\alpha}/2 $. In

\dot{\phi}^{2} < \kappa \leq \infty $ preserving Lorentz signature of the
effective metric. Slowly-rolling regime provides $\kappa < 0$ forbidding
graviton from travelling at superluminal speed. Effective gravitational
coupling and entropy of blackhole's apparent horizon are derived.
  In case of negative coupling, acceleration could happen even with $w_{\rm
eff} > -1/3$. Power-law potentials of chaotic inflation are considered. For $V
\propto \phi^2$ and $V \propto \phi^4$, it is possible to obtain

constrained by Planck 2015 \cite{Ade:2015lrj}. The $V \propto \phi^2$ case
yields acceptable range of spectrum index and $r$ values. The quartic
potential's spectrum index is disfavored by the Planck results. Viable range of
$\k$ for $V \propto \phi^2$ case lies in positive region, resulting in less

essential wireless systems, the analysis of transient phases still poses
significant challenges. Considering the majority of short-lived and interactive
flows, transient startup effects, as caused by sleep scheduling in cellular
networks, have, however, a substantial impact on the performance. To facilitate
reasoning about the transient behavior of systems, this paper contributes a
notion of non-stationary service curves. Models of systems with sleep
scheduling are derived and transient backlogs and delays are analyzed. Further,
measurement methods that estimate the service of an unknown system from
observations of selected probe traffic are developed. Fundamental limitations
of existing measurement methods are explained by the non-convexity of the
transient service and further difficulties are shown to be due to the
super-additivity of network service processes. A novel two-phase probing
technique is devised that first determines the shape of a minimal probe and
subsequently obtains an accurate estimate of the unknown service. In a
comprehensive measurement campaign, the method is used to evaluate the service
of cellular networks with sleep scheduling (2G, 3G, and 4G), revealing
considerable transient backlog and delay overshoots that persist for long
relaxation times.

complexes: an approximation to the idea of a matroid cryptomorphism in the
landscape of ordered simplicial complexes. A quasi-matroidal class contains
pure shifted simplicial complexes and ordered matroid independence complexes.
The essential property is that if a fixed simplicial complex belongs to this
class for every ordering of its vertex set, then it is a matroid independence
complex. Some examples of such classes appear implicitly in the matroid theory
literature. We introduce various such classes that highlight different apsects
of matroid theory and its similarities with the theory of shifted simplicial
complexes. For example, we lift the study of objects like the Tutte polynomial
and nbc complexes to a quasi-matroidal class that allows us to define such
objects for shifted complexes. Furthermore, some of the quasi-matroidal classes
are amenable to inductive techniques that can't be applied directly in the
context of matroid theory. As an example, we provide a suitable setting to
reformulate and extend conjecture of Stanley about $h$-vectors of matroids
which is expected to be tractable with techniques that are out of reach for
matroids alone. This new conjecture holds for pure shifted simplicial complexes
and matroids of rank up to 4.

flexible, elastic and on-demand provision. Typically, Quality of Service (QoS)
of cloud-based services can be tuned using different underlying cloud
configurations and resources, e.g., number of threads, CPU and memory etc.,
which are shared, leased and priced as utilities. This benefit is fundamentally
grounded by autoscaling: an automatic and elastic process that adapts cloud
configurations on-demand according to time-varying workloads. This thesis
proposes a holistic cloud autoscaling framework to effectively and seamlessly
address existing challenges related to different logical aspects of
autoscaling, including architecting autoscaling system, modelling the QoS of
cloud-based service, determining the granularity of control and deciding
trade-off autoscaling decisions. The framework takes advantages of the
principles of self-awareness and the related algorithms to adaptively handle
the dynamics, uncertainties, QoS interference and trade-offs on objectives that
are exhibited in the cloud. The major benefit is that, by leveraging the
framework, cloud autoscaling can be effectively achieved without heavy human
analysis and design time knowledge. Through conducting various experiments
using RUBiS benchmark and realistic workload on real cloud setting, this thesis
evaluates the effectiveness of the framework based on various quality
indicators and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

essentially includes all the information about the spectrum of the problem. We
study the bound state spectrum by working out the eigenvalues of the principal
matrix. With the help of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, we analyze how the bound
state energies change with respect to the parameters in the model. We also
prove that there are at most $N$ bound states and explicitly derive the bound

particularly investigated. We show that the ground state energy is bounded
below, and there exists a self-adjoint Hamiltonian associated with the

The scattering problem for $N$ centers is analyzed by exactly solving the
semirelativistic Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The reflection and the
transmission coefficients are numerically and asymptotically computed for the

located at a heliocentric distance of ~ 25 kpc and appear to have old and
metal-poor populations. Their distances to the Sagittarius orbital plane, ~
1.73 kpc (DES J0111-1341) and ~ 0.50 kpc (DES J0225+0304), indicate that they
are possibly associated with the Sagittarius dwarf stream. The half-light
radius (r_h ~ 4.55 pc) and luminosity (M_V ~ +0.3) of DES J0111-1341 are
consistent with it being an ultrafaint stellar cluster, while the half-light
radius (r_h ~ 18.55 pc) and luminosity (M_V ~ -1.1) of DES J0225+0304 place it
in an ambiguous region of size-luminosity space between stellar clusters and
dwarf galaxies. Determinations of the characteristic parameters of the
Sagittarius stream, metallicity spread (-2.18 < [Fe/H] < -0.95) and distance
gradient (23 kpc < D_sun < 29 kpc), within the DES footprint in the Southern
hemisphere, using the same DES data, also indicate a possible association

gels have been synthesized employing an easy refluxing method and exhaustive
rheological and viscoelastic characterizations have been performed to
understand the nature of such complex gel systems. The gels exhibit shear
thinning response with pronounced yield stress values which is indicative of a
microstructure where the graphene nanoflakes intercalate with the polymer
chains and form a pseudo spring damper network. Experimentations on the
thixotropic behavior of the gels indicate that the presence of the G nanoflakes
leads to immensely augmented structural stability capable of withstanding
severe impact shears. Further information about the localized interactions of
the G nanoflakes with the polymer chains is revealed from the amplitude and
frequency sweep analyses in both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic regimes.
Massively enhanced cross over amplitude values are recorded and several smart
effects such as enhanced elastic behavior at increasing forcing frequencies are
registered. Structural resonance induced disruption of the elastic behavior is
observed for the gels for a given range of frequency and the proposition of
resonance has been justified mathematically. It is observed that post this
resonance bandwidth, the gels are able to self-heal and regain their original
elastic behavior back without any external intervention. More detailed
information on the viscoelastic nature of the gels has been obtained from creep
and recovery compliance tests and justifications for the spring damper
microstructure has been obtained. Smart features such as enhanced stress
relaxation behavior with increasing strain have been observed and the same
explained based on the proposed microstructure.

of the existing methods, such as the HEGY test, remains unknown. This paper
analyzes the behavior of the augmented HEGY test and the unaugmented HEGY test
under periodic variation. It turns out that the asymptotic null distributions
of the HEGY statistics testing the single roots at $1$ or $-1$ when there is
periodic variation are identical to the asymptotic null distributions when
there is no periodic variation. On the other hand, the asymptotic null
distributions of the statistics testing any coexistence of roots at $1$, $-1$,
$i$, or $-i$ when there is periodic variation are non-standard and are
different from the asymptotic null distributions when there is no periodic
variation. Therefore, when periodic variation exists, HEGY tests are not
directly applicable to the joint tests for any concurrence of seasonal unit
roots. As a remedy, bootstrap is proposed; in particular, the augmented HEGY
test with seasonal independent and identically distributed (iid) bootstrap and
the unaugmented HEGY test with seasonal block bootstrap are implemented. The
consistency of these bootstrap procedures is established. The finite-sample
behavior of these bootstrap tests is illustrated via simulation and prevails
over their competitors'. Finally, these bootstrap tests are applied to detect
the seasonal unit roots in various economic time series.

architecture on top of Feature Congestion for our foveated model. We introduce
the Peripheral Integration Feature Congestion (PIFC) coefficient, as a
fundamental ingredient of our model that modulates clutter as a non-linear gain
contingent on eccentricity. We finally show that Foveated Feature Congestion
(FFC) clutter scores r(44) = -0.82 correlate better with target detection (hit
rate) than regular Feature Congestion r(44) = -0.19 in forced fixation search.
Thus, our model allows us to enrich clutter perception research by computing

problem becomes more challenging in the presence of camera error, scene motion,
and a constraint that curves are attached in a branching structure. We propose
a new general-purpose prior, a branching Gaussian processes (BGP), that models
spatial smoothness and temporal dynamics of curves while enforcing attachment
between them. We apply this prior to fit 3D trees directly to image data, using
an efficient scheme for approximate inference based on expectation propagation.
The BGP prior's Gaussian form allows us to approximately marginalize over 3D
trees with a given model structure, enabling principled comparison between tree
models with varying complexity. We test our approach on a novel multi-view

responses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted
increasing attention. Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of
diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of
infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral
responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic
infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of
particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we
study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious
individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,
labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A
susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the
U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral
responses \emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in
the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most
concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two
models are given by two methods. The analytic results \emph{quantitatively}
describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,
the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic
thresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the
suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS

with Galactic centre ejection. This number is significantly larger than what we
would expect for halo stars on radial orbits and cannot be explained by disk or
bulge contamination. If we restrict ourselves to metal-rich stars, we find 29
candidates with [Fe/H] > -0.8 dex and 10 with [Fe/H] > -0.6 dex. Their
metallicities are more consistent with what we expect for bulge ejecta, and so
we believe these candidates are especially deserving of further study. We have
supplemented this sample using our own radial velocities, developing an
algorithm to use proper motions for optimizing candidate selection. This
technique provides considerable improvement on the blind spectroscopic sample
of SDSS, being able to identify candidates with an efficiency around 20 times
better than a blind search.

available $e^+e^-$ measurements were mostly done at higher energies, mainly at

the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model in the black D4-brane background with smeared
D0-branes (D0-D4/D8 system). Because of the presence of the D0-branes, in the
bubble configuration this model is holographically dual to 4d QCD or Yang-Mills
theory with a Chern-Simons term. And the number density of the D0-branes
corresponds to the coupling constant ($\theta$ angle) of the Chern-Simons term
in the dual field theory. In this paper, we accordingly focus on small number
density of the D0-branes to study the sound mode in the black D0-D4 brane
system since the coupling of the Chern-Simons term should be quite weak in QCD.
Then we derive its 5d effective theory and analytically compute the speed of
sound and the sound wave attenuation in the approach of Gauge/Gravity duality.
Our result shows the speed of sound and the sound wave attenuation is modified
by the presence of the D0-branes. Thus they depend on the $\theta$ angle or
chiral potential in this holographic description.

suppress magnetic order by making the spin singlet between localized and
conduction electron spins. In the presence of orbital degrees of freedom,
however, there emerge exotic electronic orders induced by Kondo effect. The
orbital Kondo effect can collectively make diagonal and off-diagonal
(superconducting) orders. With the particle-hole symmetry in conduction bands,
these orders are all degenerate, forming a macroscopic SO(5) multiplet. This
paper discusses recent theoretical development on these electronic orders which
are relevant to Pr$^{3+}$ and U$^{4+}$ systems with even number of $f$
electrons per site. In the superconducting order, each conduction-electron pair
is coupled with local degrees of freedom, forming a composite entity with a
staggered spatial pattern. The quasi-particle spectrum is best interpreted as
virtual hybridization with resonant states at the Fermi level. Possible order
parameter for URu$_2$Si$_2$ in the hidden order state is discussed in the
context of composite orders. Briefly discussed are related issues such as
homogeneous odd-frequency pairing and SO(5) theory for high-temperature
superconductors.

curves and surfaces from discrete data by repeated refinements. The typical
input for such a process is a mesh of vertices. In this work we propose to
refine 2D data consisting of vertices of a polygon and a normal at each vertex.
Our core refinement procedure is based on a circle average, which is a new
non-linear weighted average of two points and their corresponding normals. The
ability to locally approximate curves by the circle average is demonstrated.
With this ability, the circle average is a candidate for modifying linear
subdivision schemes refining points, to schemes refining point-normal pairs.
This is done by replacing the weighted binary arithmetic means in a linear
subdivision scheme, expressed in terms of repeated binary averages, by circle
averages with the same weights. Here we investigate the modified
Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm and the 4-point scheme. For the case that the initial
data consists of a control polygon only, a naive method for choosing initial
normals is proposed. An example demonstrates the superiority of the above two
modified schemes, with the naive choice of initial normals over the
corresponding linear schemes, when applied to a control polygon with edges of
significantly different lengths.

incompressible flow of arbitrary direction on the equilibrium properties of
magnetically confined, axisymmetric toroidal plasmas. The main novel
contribution is the derivation of a pertinent generalised Grad-Shafranov
equation. This equation includes six free surface functions and recovers known
Grad-Shafranov-like equations in the literature as well as the usual static,
isotropic one. The form of the generalised equation indicates that pressure
anisotropy and flow act additively on equilibrium. In addition, two sets of
analytical solutions, an extended Solovev one with a plasma reaching the
separatrix and an extended Hernegger-Maschke one for a plasma surrounded by a
fixed boundary possessing an X-point, are constructed, particularly in
relevance to the ITER and NSTX tokamaks. Furthermore, the impacts both of
pressure anisotropy, through an anisotropy function assumed to be uniform on
the magnetic surfaces, and plasma flow, via the variation of an Alfvenic Mach
function, on these equilibria are examined.
  It turns out that depending on the maximum value and the shape of an
anisotropy function, the anisotropy can act either paramagnetically or
diamagnetically. Also, in most of the cases considered both the anisotropy and
the flow have stronger effects on NSTX equilibria than on ITER ones. We
conjecture that these effects may have an influence on plasma stability and
transport, and play a role in the transitions to the improved confinement
regimes in tokamaks.

of the prominence-horn cavity system remain elusive. Here we present
observations of such a system, focusing on a section of the prominence that
rises and separates gradually from the main body. This forms a configuration
sufficiently simple to yield clues to the above issues. It is characterized by
embedding horns, oscillations, and a gradual disappearance of the separated
material. The prominence-horn structure exhibits a large amplitude longitudinal
oscillation with a period of ~150 minutes and an amplitude of ~30 Mm along the
trajectory defined by the concave horn structure. The horns also experience a
simultaneous transverse oscillation with a much smaller amplitude (~3 Mm) and
shorter period (~10-15 minutes), likely representative of a global mode of the
large-scale magnetic structure. The gradual disappearance of the structure
indicates that the horn, an observational manifestation of the field-aligned
transition region separating the cool and dense prominence from the hot and
tenuous corona, is formed due to the heating and diluting process of the
central prominence mass, while most previous studies suggest that it is the
opposite process, i.e., the cooling and condensation of coronal plasmas, to
form the horn. This study also demonstrates how the prominence transports

Found. (2017)","10.1007/s40509-017-0122-1",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The task of device independent secure key distribution requires preparation
and subsequently distribution of nonlocal resources. For secured practical
implementation, one needs to take two initially uncorrelated quantum systems
and perform a unitary on the composite system to generate the nonlocal
resource, which is supposed to violate a Bell inequality (say, Bell-CHSH).
States which do not violate Bell-CHSH inequality, but violate it when
transformed by a global unitary, can be deemed useful for the preparation of
nonlocal resource. One may then start from a state which is Bell-CHSH local
(take for example, a pure product state) and apply an appropriate global
unitary on it which results in a Bell-CHSH non-local state. However, an
intriguing fact is the existence of useless states from which no Bell-CHSH
non-local resource can be generated with a global unitary. This is due to the
purity preserving nature of unitary operators which bound the amount of
correlation in the set of final states depending on the purity of the initial
(possibly uncorrelated) states. The present work confirms the existence of such
a set, pertaining to two qubit systems. The set exhibits counter intuitive
features by containing within it some entangled states which remain Bell-CHSH
local on the action of any unitary. From practical perspective, this work draws
a line between useful and useless states for the task of preparing nonlocal
resource using global unitary transformations. Furthermore through an analytic
characterization of the set we lay down a generic prescription through which
one can operationally identify the useful states. It has also been shown that
our prescription remains valid for any linear Bell inequality.

different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and computer science

the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter
sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick
a given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to
an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an
attacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading
alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least
restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model
and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state
automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis
algorithm, which ensures that a computed supervisor will be ABSRA-robust ,
i.e., either an ABSRA will be detectable or will not lead the system to an

in the supervisory control community. One strategy is to reduce the size of a
supervisor to generate a control equivalent version, whose size is hopefully
much smaller than the original one so that a user or control designer can
easily check whether a designed controller fulfils its objectives and
requirements. After the first journal paper on this topic appeared in 1986 by
Vaz and Wonham, which relied on the concept of control covers, in 2004 Su and
Wonham proposed to use control congruences to ensure computational viability.
This work is later adopted in the supervisor localization theory, which aims
for a control equivalent distributed implementation of a given centralized
supervisor. But after so many publications, some fundamental questions, which
should have been addressed in the first place, have not been answered yet,
namely what information is critical to ensure control equivalence, what
information is responsible for size reduction, and whether the partial
observation really makes things different. In this paper we will address these
fundamental questions by showing that there does exist a unified supervisor
reduction theory, which is applicable to all feasible supervisors regardless of
whether they are under full observation or partial observation. Our theory
provides a partial order over all control equivalent feasible supervisors based
on their enabling, disabling and marking information, which can be used to
categorize the corresponding reduction rates. Based on this result we can see
that, given two control equivalent feasible supervisors, the one under full
observation can always result in a reduced supervisor no bigger than that
induced by a supervisor under partial observation.

volume-phase holographic gratings. The cascade consists of three gratings. Each
of them provides moderately high spectral resolution in a narrow range of 83
nm. Thus the spectrum image represents three lines covering region 430-680 nm.
Two versions of the scheme are described: a full-scale one with estimated
resolving power of 5300-7900 and a small-sized one intended for creation of a
lab prototype, which provides the resolving power of 1500-3000. Diffraction
efficiency modeling confirms that the system throughput can reach 75 %, while
stray light caused by the gratings crosstalk is negligible. We also propose a
design of image slicer and focal reducer allowing to couple the instrument with
the 6-m telescope. Finally, we present concept of the opto-mechanical design.

  Algorithm","86 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new concept of approximation applicable to decision problems
and functions, inspired by Bayesian probability. From the perspective of a
Bayesian reasoner with limited computational resources, the answer to a problem
that cannot be solved exactly is uncertain and therefore should be described by
a random variable. It thus should make sense to talk about the expected value
of this random variable, an idea we formalize in the language of average-case
complexity theory by introducing the concept of ""optimal polynomial-time
estimators."" We prove some existence theorems and completeness results, and
show that optimal polynomial-time estimators exhibit many parallels with
""classical"" probability theory.

namely, acceptable strategy profiles. For each player $i$ and state $s$ in a
stochastic game, let $w_i(s)$ be a real number. A strategy profile is
\emph{$w$-acceptable}, where $w=(w_i(s))$, if the discounted payoff to each
player $i$ at every initial state $s$ is at least $w_i(s)$, provided the
discount factor of the players is sufficiently close to 1. Our goal is to
provide simple strategy profiles that are $w$-acceptable for payoff vectors $w$
in which all coordinates are high.

real conducting cylindrical shells [1]), the Casimir force experienced by a
spherical shell, under Dirichlet boundary condition, is calculated. The
renormalization procedure is based on the plasma cut-off frequency for real
conductors. The real case of a gold (silver) sphere is considered and the
corresponding electromagnetic Casimir force is computed. In the covariant
approach, there isn't any decomposition of fields to TE and TM modes; thus, we
do not need to consider the Neumann boundary condition in parallel to the
Dirichlet problem and then add their corresponding results.

call interface, has the distinct advantage of smaller run-time resource
requirements as compared to HAL-level virtualization techniques, and thus forms
an important building block for virtualizing parallel and distributed
applications such as a HPC clusters. Because the Windows operating system puts
certain critical functionalities in privileged user-level system service
processes, a complete OS-level virtualization solution for the Windows platform
requires duplication of such Windows service as Remote Procedure Call Server
Service (RPCSS). As many implementation details of the Windows system services
are proprietary, duplicating Windows system services becomes the key technical
challenge for virtualizing the Windows platform at the OS level. Moreover, as a
core component of cloud computing, IIS web server-related services need to be
duplicated in containers (i.e., OS-level virtual machines), but so far there is
no such scheme. In this paper, we thoroughly identify all issues that affect
service duplication, and then propose the first known methodology to
systematically duplicate both system and ordinary Windows services. Our
experiments show that the methodology can duplicate a set of system and
ordinary services on different versions of Windows OS.

kidney function. Here we develop a computational model of the rat kidney and
use it to investigate the relationship between arterial blood pressure and
interstitial fluid pressure. In addition, we investigate how tissue flexibility
influences this relationship. Due to the complexity of the model, the large
number of parameters, and the inherent uncertainty of the experimental data, we
utilize Monte Carlo sampling to study the model's behavior under a wide range
of parameter values and to compute first- and total-order sensitivity indices.
Characteristically, at elevated arterial blood pressure, the model predicts
cases with increased or reduced interstitial pressure. The transition between
the two cases is controlled mostly by the compliance of the blood vessels
located before the afferent arterioles.
