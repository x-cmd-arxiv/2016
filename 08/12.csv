insights into the complexities of brain function. Here, we investigate both
densely connected groups of nodes that could perform local computations as well
as larger patterns of interactions that would allow for parallel processing.
Finding such structures necessitates we move from considering pairwise
interactions to capturing higher order relations, concepts naturally expressed
in the language of algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study
mesoscale structures arising from the arrangement of densely connected
substructures called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We
detect cliques (all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average

large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and link regions of early and late
evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that

transition (MIT) in perovskite systems with d^1 and d^2 electron configuration

expected from the changes in the crystal-field splitting and in the hopping
parameters that are induced by epitaxial strain. We argue that the
strain-induced crystal-field splitting generally favors the Mott-insulating
state, whereas the strain-induced changes in the hopping parameters favor the
metallic state under compressive strain and the insulating state under tensile
strain. Thus, the two effects can effectively cancel each other under
compressive strain, while they usually cooperate under tensile strain, in this
case favoring the insulating state. We then validate these general
considerations by performing electronic structure calculations for several d^1
and d^2 perovskites, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We isolate the individual effects of
strain-induced changes in either hopping or crystal-field by performing DMFT
calculations where we fix one type of parameter to the corresponding unstrained
DFT values. These calculations confirm our general considerations for SrVO_3
(d^1) and LaVO_3 (d^2), whereas the case of LaTiO_3 (d^1) is distinctly
different, due to the strong effect of the octahedral tilt distortion in the
underlying perovskite crystal structure. Our results demonstrate the
possibility to tune the electronic properties of correlated TM oxides by using
epitaxial strain, which allows to control the strength of electronic
correlations and the vicinity to the Mott MIT.

astrometric observations over the last 7 years. We combine this dataset with
distance estimates to compute the total mass of the systems. We also compute
preliminary individual component masses for the five systems with available SB2
radial velocities. Nine over the ten binaries have their three dimensional
orbit well constrained. Four of them are known colliding wind, non-thermal
radio emitters, and thus constitute valuable targets for future high angular
resolution radio imaging. Two binaries break the correlation between period and
eccentricity tentatively observed in previous studies. It suggests either that
massive star formation produce a wide range of systems, or that several binary
formation mechanisms are at play. Finally, we found that the use of existing
SB2 radial velocity amplitudes can lead to unrealistic masses and distances. If
not understood, the biases in radial velocity amplitudes will represent an
intrinsic limitation for estimating dynamical masses from SB2+interferometry or

peak-to-peak variations of about $30\%$ and ""bluer-when-brighter"" spectral
evolution, consisting of a day-timescale modulation with superimposed hourlong
microflares characterized by $\sim 0.1$\,mag flux changes. We performed an

the presence of oscillations on timescales of $\sim 3$\,h and $\sim 5$\,h do

spectrum. We observed that, at a certain configuration of the optical
polarization angle relative to the positional angle of the innermost radio jet
in the source, changes in the polarization degree led the total flux
variability by about 2\,h; meanwhile, when the relative configuration of the
polarization and jet angles altered, no such lag could be noted. The
microflaring events, when analyzed as separate pulse emission components, were
found to be characterized by a very high polarization degree ($> 30\%$) and
polarization angles which differed substantially from the polarization angle of

Pioline introduced generalized error functions and used them to construct
indefinite theta series associated to quadratic lattices L of signature
(n-2,2). These series are generalizations of those constructed by Zwegers for
lattices of signature (n-1,1) and are shown to be `modular completions' of
certain nice $q$-series. In this paper, we show that the ABMP-indefinite theta
series for signature (n-2,2) can also be obtained as integrals of the form
valued theta series introduced in joint work with J. Millson in 1986. Given two
pairs {C1,C2} and {C2,C2'} of negative vectors in the real quadratic space V
obtained from L, we suppose that these vectors determine 4 distinct oriented
negative 2-planes {C1,C2},{C1,C2'},{C1',C2'},{C1',C2} lying in the same
component of the space D of oriented negative 2 -planes in V. These 2-planes
determined a surface S in D and the non-holomorphic modular form obtained by
integrating the KM-theta series over S is show to coincide with the
ABMP-indefinite theta series. Moreover, the associated q-series in interpreted
as the generating series for the intersection numbers of S with the codimension
2 subspaces D_x of D defined by positive lattice vectors.

multi-radios tuned to non-overlapping channels. Hence the data forwarding
between two nodes has multiple selections of links and the bandwidth between
the pair of nodes varies dynamically. Under this condition, a mesh node adopts
machine learning mechanisms to choose the possible best next hop which has
maximum bandwidth when it intends to forward data. In this paper, we present a
machine learning based forwarding algorithm to let a forwarding node
dynamically select the next hop with highest potential bandwidth capacity to
resume communication based on learning algorithm. Key to this strategy is that
a node only maintains three past status, and then it is able to learn and
predict the potential bandwidth capacities of its links. Then, the node selects
the next hop with potential maximal link bandwidth. Moreover, a geometrical
based algorithm is developed to let the source node figure out the forwarding
region in order to avoid flooding. Simulations demonstrate that our approach
significantly speeds up the transmission and outperforms other peer algorithms.

S\'ersic indices of $n\sim 2.2 - 3.6$ and stellar masses of $M_{*}$ $\sim
0.28\times10^{10} - 1.1\times10^{10} M_{\sun}$. NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have
intermediate-scale `pseudo-bulges' that are well described by a S\'ersic model

apertures, finding that NGC 2681 has a LINER-type emission inside $R \sim
3\arcsec$, but the emission line due to star formation is significant when
aperture size is increased. In contrast, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have composite

goals in the field of meteoritics. Recently the idea of planet(esimal)
collisions releasing splashes of lava droplets, long considered out of favor,
has been reconsidered as a possible origin of chondrules by several papers. One
of the main problems with this idea is the lack of quantitative and simple
models that can be used to test this scenario by directly comparing to the many
known observables of chondrules. In Paper I of this series we presented a
simple thermal evolution model of a spherically symmetric expanding cloud of
molten lava droplets that is assumed to emerge from a collision between two
planetesimals. In the present paper, number II of this series, we use this
model to calculate whether or not volatile elements such as Na and K will
remain abundant in these droplets or whether they will get depleted due to
evaporation. The high density of the droplet cloud (e.g. small distance between
adjacent droplets) causes the vapor to quickly reach saturation pressure and
thus shutting down further evaporation. We show to which extent, and under
which conditions, this keeps the abundances of these elements high, as is seen
in chondrules. We find that for most parameters of our model (cloud mass,
expansion velocity, initial temperature) the volatile elements Mg, Si and Fe
remain entirely in the chondrules. The Na and K abundances inside the droplets
will initially stay mostly at their initial values due to the saturation of the
vapor pressure, but at some point start to drop due to the cloud expansion.
However, as soon as the temperature starts to decrease, most or all of the
vapor recondenses again. At the end the Na and K elements retain most of their
initial abundances, albeit occasionally somewhat reduced, depending on the
parameters of the expanding cloud model.

moderate resolution spectra obtained for 91 turnoff (and subgiant) stars with
the ESO FLAMES-Giraffe spectrograph, we have extended previous measurements of
abundances (of Li, C and Na) to other elements (C, Si, Ca, Sr and Ba), using
model atmosphere analysis. We have also studied the influence of the choice of
the microturbulent velocity. Firstly, the peculiar turnoff star found to be
very Li-rich in a previous paper does not show any other abundance anomalies
relative to the other turnoff stars in M4. ~Secondly, an anti-correlation
between C and Na has been detected, the slope being significative at more than
$3\sigma$. This relation between C and Na is in perfect agreement with the
relation found in giant stars selected below the RGB bump. ~Thirdly, the strong
enrichment of Si and of the neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba, already
observed in the giants in M4, is confirmed. ~Finally, the relations between Li,
C, Na, Sr and Ba constrain the enrichment processes of the observed stars. The
abundances of the elements in the turnoff stars appear to be compatible with
production processes by massive AGBs, but are also compatible with the
production of second generation elements (like Na) and low Li produced by, for
example, fast rotating massive stars.

  Because weak proregularity is defined in terms of elements of the ring
(specifically, it involves limits of Koszul complexes), it is not suitable for
noncommutative ring theory.
  In this paper we introduce a new condition on a torsion class T in a module
category: weak stability. Our first main theorem is that in the commutative
case, the ideal \a is weakly proregular if and only if the corresponding
torsion class T_{\a} is weakly stable.
  We then study weak stability of torsion classes in module categories over
noncommutative rings. There are three main theorems in this context: - For a
torsion class T that is weakly stable, quasi-compact and finite dimensional,
the right derived torsion functor is isomorphic to a left derived tensor
functor. - The Noncommutative MGM Equivalence, under the same assumptions on T.
- A theorem about symmetric derived torsion for complexes of bimodules. This
last theorem is a generalization of a result of Van den Bergh from 1997, and
corrects an error in a paper of Yekutieli-Zhang from 2003.

characterized by a positive value of the ${\gamma}_2$ Pearson kurtosis, i.e.,
they have a distribution with a more concentrated peak and larger tails than
the Gaussian one. Currently, eight families are known to have ${\gamma}_2(v_W)
> 0.25$. Among these, three are highly inclined asteroid families, the Hansa,
Barcelona, and Gallia families. As observed for the case of the Astrid family,
the leptokurtic inclination distribution seems to be caused by the interaction
of these families with node secular resonances. In particular, the Hansa and
Gallia family are crossed by the $s-s_V$ resonance with Vesta, that
significantly alters the inclination of some of their members.
  In this work we use the time evolution of ${\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for simulated
families under the gravitational influence of all planets and the three most
massive bodies in the main belt to assess the dynamical importance (or lack of)
node secular resonances with Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas for the considered
families, and to obtain independent constraints on the family ages. While
secular resonances with massive bodies in the main belt do not significantly
affect the dynamical evolution of the Barcelona family, they significantly
increase the ${\gamma}_2(v_W)$ values of the simulated Hansa and Gallia
families. Current values of the ${\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for the Gallia family are
reached over the estimated family age only if secular resonances with Vesta are
accounted for.

kinetic theory with Berry phase for a non-interacting ensemble of fermions -- a
Berry Fermi gas -- which might be far-from-equilibrium. We particularly review
the famous Berry phase contribution to the anomalous Hall current. We then
provide a concrete and general path integral derivation for the semi-classical
theory. Then we turn to the specific example of Weyl fermion, which exhibits
the profound quantum phenomenon of chiral anomaly; we review how this quantum
effect, and its closely related chiral magnetic effect and chiral vortical
effect, arise from Berry phase in the semi-classical kinetic theory. We also
discuss how Lorentz symmetry in the kinetic theory of Weyl fermion, seemly
violated by the Berry phase term, is realized non-trivially; we provide a
physical interpretation for this non-trivial realization, and discuss its
mathematical foundation in Wigner translation. Next, we turn towards
interacting fermionic systems. We consider Fermi liquid near equilibrium, and
propose the Berry Fermi liquid theory -- the extension to Landau Fermi liquid
theory incorporating Berry phase (and other) effects. In our proposed Berry
Fermi liquid theory, we can show the Berry phase is a Fermi surface property,
qualitatively unmodified by interactions. But there also arise new effects from
interactions, most notably the emergent electric dipole moment which
contributes to the anomalous Hall current in addition to the usual Berry phase
contribution. We prove our proposed Berry Fermi liquid theory from quantum
field theory to all orders in Feynman diagram expansion under very general

field, to analyze the effect of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
orientation and intensity, as well as the hydrodynamic parameters of the solar
wind (velocity, density and temperature), on the net power dissipated on the

perform a set of simulations with different hydrodynamic parameters of the
solar wind, IMF orientations and intensities, that allow us to calculate the
dissipated power distribution and infer the existence of radio emission hot
spots on the planet day side, and to calculate the integrated radio emission of
the Hermean magnetosphere. Results: The obtained radio emission distribution of
dissipated power is determined by the IMF orientation (associated with the
reconnection regions in the magnetosphere), although the radio emission
strength is dependent on the IMF intensity and solar wind hydro parameters. The
calculated total radio emission level is in agreement with the one estimated in

\rho_u + o(1)} + O(dn)$ and query time $n^{\rho_q + o(1)} + d n^{o(1)}$ for

  This is the first data structure that achieves sublinear query time and
near-linear space for every approximation factor $c > 1$, improving upon
[Kapralov, PODS 2015]. The data structure is a culmination of a long line of
work on the problem for all space regimes; it builds on Spherical
Locality-Sensitive Filtering [Becker, Ducas, Gama, Laarhoven, SODA 2016] and
data-dependent hashing [Andoni, Indyk, Nguyen, Razenshteyn, SODA 2014] [Andoni,

  Our matching lower bounds are of two types: conditional and unconditional.
First, we prove tightness of the whole above trade-off in a restricted model of
computation, which captures all known hashing-based approaches. We then show
unconditional cell-probe lower bounds for one and two probes that match the
above trade-off for $\rho_q = 0$, improving upon the best known lower bounds
from [Panigrahy, Talwar, Wieder, FOCS 2010]. In particular, this is the first

observed patterns of human movement arise because subjects select those ways to
execute movements that are, in a rigorous sense, optimal. In this project, we
show how this proposition can guide the development of computational models of
movement selection and thereby account for human movement patterns. We proceed
by first developing a movement utility formalism that operationalizes the
concept of a best or optimal way of executing a movement using a utility
function so that the problem of movement selection becomes the problem of
finding the movement that maximizes the utility function. Since the movement
utility formalism includes a contribution of the metabolic energy of the
movement (maximum utility movements try to minimize metabolic energy), we also
develop a metabolic energy formalism that we can use to construct estimators of
the metabolic energies of particular movements. We then show how we can
construct an estimator for the metabolic energies of normal walking gaits and
we use that estimator to construct a movement utility model of the selection of
normal walking gaits and show that the relationship between avg. walking speed
and avg. step length predicted by this model agrees with observation. We
conclude by proposing a physical mechanism that a subject might use to estimate
the metabolic energy of a movement in practice.

stopping time and dust-to-gas ratio intersect the allowed region for streaming
instability-induced gravitational collapse. Using an approximate analytic
treatment, we first show that drifting particles define a track in
metallicity--stopping time space whose only substantial dependence is on the
disk's angular momentum transport efficiency. Prompt planetesimal formation is
feasible for high particle accretion rates (relative to the gas, $\dot{M}_p /
\dot{M} > 3 \times 10^{-2}$ for $\alpha = 10^{-2}$), that could only be
sustained for a limited period of time. If it is possible, it would lead to the
deposition of a broad and massive belt of planetesimals with a sharp outer
edge. Including turbulent diffusion and vapor condensation processes
numerically, we find that a modest enhancement of solids near the snow line
occurs for cm-sized particles, but that this is largely immaterial for
planetesimal formation. We note that radial drift couples planetesimal
formation across radii in the disk, and suggest that considerations of

principle, a piece of common wisdom in conceptual frameworks developed to
describe species assemblages. Key concepts in community ecology, such as
limiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion.
However, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from
simple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric,
deterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different
from the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic
stochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the
steady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three
species, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a
cascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a
multiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have
studied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species
symmetry assumption. Our conclusions highlight the crucial role of
stochasticity when deriving reliable theoretical predictions for species
community assembly.

between the thermodynamical entropy and the probabilities of the microscopic
configurations of the system. His entropic functional for classical systems was
extended by Gibbs to the entire phase space of a many-body system, and by von
Neumann in order to cover quantum systems as well. Finally, it was used by
Shannon within the theory of information. The simplest expression of this
functional corresponds to a discrete set of $W$ microscopic possibilities, and
is given by $S_{BG}= -k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$ ($k$ is a positive universal
constant; {\it BG} stands for {\it Boltzmann-Gibbs}). This relation enables the
construction of BG statistical mechanics. The BG theory has provided
uncountable important applications. Its application in physical systems is
legitimate whenever the hypothesis of {\it ergodicity} is satisfied. However,
{\it what can we do when ergodicity and similar simple hypotheses are
violated?}, which indeed happens in very many natural, artificial and social
complex systems. It was advanced in 1988 the possibility of generalizing BG
statistical mechanics through a family of nonadditive entropies, namely
$S_q=k\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$, which recovers the additive $S_{BG}$
entropy in the $q \to1$ limit. The index $q$ is to be determined from
mechanical first principles. Along three decades, this idea intensively evolved
world-wide (see Bibliography in \url{http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm}),
and led to a plethora of predictions, verifications, and applications in
physical systems and elsewhere. As expected whenever a {\it paradigm shift} is
explored, some controversy naturally emerged as well in the community. The
present status of the general picture is here described, starting from its
dynamical and thermodynamical foundations, and ending with its most recent
physical applications.

-- from biological networks, to social organizations and transportation
systems. Recently there has been much progress in understanding the general
properties of multilayer networks, our understanding of how to control such
systems remains limited. One aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is
that each layer can operate at a different timescale, thus we cannot directly
apply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks.
Here we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-timescale
networks focusing on two-layer multiplex networks with one-to-one interlayer
coupling. We investigate the case when the control signal is applied to the
nodes of one layer. We develop a theory based on disjoint path covers to
determine the minimum number of inputs ($N_\T i$) necessary for full control.
We show that if both layers operate on the same timescale then the network
structure of both layers equally affect controllability. In the presence of
timescale separation, controllability is enhanced if the controller interacts
with the faster layer: $N_\T i$ decreases as the timescale difference increases
up to a critical timescale difference, above which $N_\T i$ remains constant
and is completely determined by the faster layer. In contrast, control becomes
increasingly difficult if the controller interacts with the layer operating on
the slower timescale and increasing timescale separation leads to increased
$N_\T i$, again up to a critical value, above which $N_\T i$ still depends on
the structure of both layers. By identifying the underlying mechanisms that
connect timescale difference and controllability for a simplified model, we
provide insight into disentangling how our ability to control real interacting
complex systems is affected by a variety of sources of complexity.

strive as a new kind of organization, open source must provide production
gains, which in turn should be measurable. The open source movement is
particularly interesting to study for this reason. Here, we confront and
discuss two contrasting views, which were reported in the literature recently.
On the one hand, Sornette et al. uncovered a superlinear production mechanism,
which quantifies Aristotle adage: `the whole is more than the sum of its
parts'. On the other hand, Scholtes et al. found opposite results, and referred
to Maximilien Ringelmann, a French agricultural engineer (1861-1931), who
discovered the tendency for individual members of a group to become
increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases. Since
Ringelmann, the topic of collective intelligence has interested numbers of
researchers in social sciences and social psychology, as well as practitioners
in management aiming at improving the performance of their team. In most
research and practice case studies, the Ringelmann effect has been found to
hold, while, in contrast, the superlinear effect found by Sornette et al.is
novel and may challenge common wisdom. Here, we compare these two theories,
weigh their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss how they have been tested

design a pipeline schedule to reduce latency for real-time recognition and a
fixed-rate schedule to reduce overall computation. Finally, we extend clockwork

an object imposes a random back action perturbation on its momentum. This
randomness translates with time into position uncertainty, thus leading to the
well known uncertainty on the measurement of motion. Here we demonstrate that
the quantum back action on a macroscopic mechanical oscillator measured in the
reference frame of an atomic spin oscillator can be evaded. The collective
quantum measurement on this novel hybrid system of two distant and disparate
oscillators is performed with light. The mechanical oscillator is a drum mode
of a millimeter size dielectric membrane and the spin oscillator is an atomic
ensemble in a magnetic field. The spin oriented along the field corresponds to
an energetically inverted spin population and realizes an effective negative
mass oscillator, while the opposite orientation corresponds to a positive mass
oscillator. The quantum back action is evaded in the negative mass setting and
is enhanced in the positive mass case. The hybrid quantum system presented here
paves the road to entanglement generation and distant quantum communication
between mechanical and spin systems and to sensing of force, motion and gravity
beyond the standard quantum limit.

  applicability of the Kirchhoff law",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Kirchhoff law of thermal radiation, relating emissivity {\epsilon} and
absorptance {\alpha}, has been originally formulated for opaque bodies in
thermodynamic equilibrium with the environment. However, in many systems of
practical importance, both assumptions are often not satisfied. In this work,
we revisit the century-old law and examine the limits of its applicability in
an example of Er:YAG and Er:YLF dielectric crystals, potential radiation
converters for thermophotovoltaic applications. In our experiments, the (80
at.%) Er:YAG crystal was opaque between 1.45 {\mu}m and 1.64 {\mu}m. In this
spectral range, its absorptance {\alpha}({\lambda}) is spectrally flat and
differentiates from unity only by a small amount of reflection. The shape of
the emissivity spectrum {\epsilon}({\lambda}) closely matches that of
absorptance {\alpha}({\lambda}), suggesting that the Kirchhoff law can
adequately describe thermal radiation of opaque bodies, even if the requirement
of thermodynamic equilibrium is not satisfied. The(20 at.%) Er:YLF crystal had
smaller size, lower concentration of Er ions, and it was not opaque.
Nevertheless, its spectrum of emissivity {\epsilon}({\lambda}) had almost the
same shape (between 1.45 {\mu}m and 1.62 {\mu}m) as the spectrum of absorptance
{\alpha}({\lambda}) derived from the transmission measurements. This
observation is in line with our prediction that the spectra of emissivity and
absorptance should have identical shapes in optically thin slabs. We, thus,
show that the Kirchhoff law of thermal radiation can be extended (with caution)
even to not-opaque bodies away from the thermodynamic equilibrium.

distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, and additional degrees of

the relationship between connectivity and motion, but unmask distance-dependent

reflects two extremes of the possible relation between the average dust

Unfortunately, as we confirmed in many interviews with quality assurance

testing of Android apps, we propose a new technique that allows testers to
easily create platform independent test scripts for an app and automatically
run the generated test scripts on multiple devices and operating system

encode user defined test cases as test scripts with built-in oracles, generates
test scripts that can run on multiple platforms, and can outperform a

supports a specific Borel probability measure, called the Hutchinson measure,
which itself satisfies a fixed point relation. P. Jorgensen generalized the

correlation between stocks to achieve statistical arbitrage. Existing
pairs-trading algorithms in the literature require rather restrictive
assumptions on the underlying stochastic stock-price processes and the
so-called spread function. In contrast to existing literature, we consider an
algorithm for pairs trading which requires less restrictive assumptions than
heretofore considered. Since our point of view is control-theoretic in nature,
the analysis and results are straightforward to follow by a non-expert in
finance. To this end, we describe a general pairs-trading algorithm which
allows the user to define a rather arbitrary spread function which is used in a
feedback context to modify the investment levels dynamically over time. When
this function, in combination with the price process, satisfies a certain
mean-reversion condition, we deem the stocks to be a tradeable pair. For such a
case, we prove that our control-inspired trading algorithm results in positive
expected growth in account value. Finally, we describe tests of our algorithm
on historical trading data by fitting stock price pairs to a popular spread
function used in literature. Simulation results from these tests demonstrate
robust growth while avoiding huge drawdowns.

model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation

encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have
been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian
structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back
to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The
dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian
phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts
for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate
hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In
harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in
small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model
permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record

First, a new sum-MSE of all users based minimization problem is proposed aiming
to design a set of macro cell (MC) and SC transmit precoding matrices or
vectors. To solve it, two different algorithms are presented. One is via a
relaxed-constraints based alternating optimization (RAO) realized by efficient
alternating optimization and relaxing non-convex constraints to convex ones.
The other is via an unconstrained alternating optimization with normalization
(UAON) implemented by introducing the constraints into the iterations with the
normalization operation. Second, a separate MSE minimization based precoding is
proposed by considering the signal and interference terms corresponding to the
macro tier and the SCs separately. Simulation results show that the sum-MSE
based RAO algorithm provides the best MSE performance among the proposed
schemes under a number of system configurations. When the number of antennas at
the macro-BS is sufficiently large, the MSE of the separate MSE-based precoding
is found to approach that of RAO and surpass that of UAON. Together, this paper
provides a suite of three new precoding techniques that is expected to meet the
need in a broad range of HetNet environments with adequate balance between

matrix $A$ with a subset $S$ of $k$ special rows (hubs): entries in rows
outside $S$ are generated from the probability distribution $p_0 \sim
N(0,\sigma_0^2)$; for each row in $S$, some $k$ of its entries are generated
from $p_1 \sim N(0,\sigma_1^2)$, $\sigma_1>\sigma_0$, and the rest of the
entries from $p_0$. The problem is to identify the high-degree hubs
efficiently. This model includes and significantly generalizes the planted
Gaussian Submatrix Model, where the special entries are all in a $k \times k$
submatrix. There are two well-known barriers: if $k\geq c\sqrt{n\ln n}$, just
the row sums are sufficient to find $S$ in the general model. For the submatrix
problem, this can be improved by a $\sqrt{\ln n}$ factor to $k \ge c\sqrt{n}$
by spectral methods or combinatorial methods. In the variant with $p_0=\pm 1$
(with probability $1/2$ each) and $p_1\equiv 1$, neither barrier has been
broken.
  We give a polynomial-time algorithm to identify all the hidden hubs with high
probability for $k \ge n^{0.5-\delta}$ for some $\delta >0$, when
$\sigma_1^2>2\sigma_0^2$. The algorithm extends to the setting where planted
entries might have different variances each at least as large as $\sigma_1^2$.
We also show a nearly matching lower bound: for $\sigma_1^2 \le 2\sigma_0^2$,
there is no polynomial-time Statistical Query algorithm for distinguishing
between a matrix whose entries are all from $N(0,\sigma_0^2)$ and a matrix with
$k=n^{0.5-\delta}$ hidden hubs for any $\delta >0$. The lower bound as well as
the algorithm are related to whether the chi-squared distance of the two
distributions diverges. At the critical value $\sigma_1^2=2\sigma_0^2$, we show
that the general hidden hubs problem can be solved for $k\geq c\sqrt n(\ln
n)^{1/4}$, improving on the naive row sum-based method.

hybrid optical-thermal antennas that support high-quality-factor
photonic-plasmonic modes enable up to two orders of magnitude enhancement of
localized electric fields and of the optical power absorbed in the nanoscale
metal volume. At the same time, the hybrid antenna temperature can be lowered
by several hundred degrees with respect to its all-metal counterpart under
continuous irradiance of 104-105 W/m2. The temperature reduction effect is
attributed to the enhanced radiative cooling, which is mediated by the
thermally-excited localized surface phonon polariton modes. We further show
that temperature reduction under even higher irradiances can be achieved by a
combination of enhanced radiative and convective cooling in hybrid antennas.
Finally, we demonstrate how hybrid optical-thermal antennas can be used to
achieve strong localized heating of nanoparticles while keeping the rest of the

theoretical analysis shows that under the assumption of convexity of the agents
utilities, the proposed auction is still able to maximize the social welfare

the mechanism exhibits the key desirable features of individual rationality and
weak budget balance, guaranteeing that neither the payoff to any agent nor the

gas-rich galaxies with f_g > 0.1, gas temperatures rise slowly from center of
the halo out to the virial radius and average neutral gas column densities
remain above 10^19 atoms cm^-2 out to radii of 50-70 kpc. In gas-poor galaxies
with f_g < 0.1, gas temperatures rise quickly outside the edge of the disk to
10^6 K, and then remain fixed out to radii of 100 kpc. The column density of
neutral gas quickly drops below 10^19 atoms cm^-2 at radii of 10 kpc. Neutral
gas distributions are also more asymmetric in gas-poor galaxies. Most of the
differences between gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies in the Illustris simulation
can be attributed to the effects of ""radio-mode"" AGN feedback. In the Illustris
simulation, the circumgalactic gas is found to rotate coherently about the
center of the galaxy with a maximum rotational velocity of around 200 km/s. In
gas-rich galaxies, the average coherence length of the rotating gas is 40 kpc,
compared to 10 kpc in gas-poor galaxies. In the very most gas-rich systems, the
CGM can rotate coherently over scales of 70-100 kpc. We discuss our results in

human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms
underlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings
spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social
network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and
spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using
conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are
collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals,
online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the
perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the
analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is
more contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up
tweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels
easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different
communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content
more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion
and weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The
diffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides
further testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals
a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. Our
findings shed light on both personal anger management in human communications

storage reduction and expedited image search. Conventional hashing schemes
typically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions, which separates the
procedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and
non-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions in
this paper are two-folds: 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by
gradient propagation, which critically requires a smooth objective function.
The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based
optimization. To address this issue, we propose an exponentiated hashing loss
function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation
and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in
supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality
has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a
pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image
classification, and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive
quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks.
On all benchmarks, our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all
state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular, our
algorithm achieves a near-perfect 0.99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy
with only 12 bits on MNIST, and a new record of 0.74 on the CIFAR10 dataset. In

POD truncation can degrade the approximation of the Hamiltonian function, we
propose to use the POD basis from shifted snapshots to improve the Hamiltonian

predictions from three different halo and subhalo models. One is the halo
occupation distribution (HOD) model and the other two are extensions of the
subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model by allowing the central and satellite
galaxies to have different occupation distributions in the host halos and
subhalos. Parameters in all the models are chosen to best describe the
projected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) of the
same set of galaxies. All three model predictions agree well with the 3PCF
measurements for the most luminous galaxy sample, while the HOD model better
performs in matching the 3PCFs of fainter samples (with luminosity threshold
below $L^*$), which is similar in trend to the case of fitting the 2PCFs. The
decomposition of the model 3PCFs into contributions from different types of
galaxy triplets shows that on small scales the dependence of the 3PCFs on
triangle shape is driven by nonlinear redshift-space distortion (and not by the
intrinsic halo shape) while on large scales it reflects the filamentary
structure. The decomposition also reveals more detailed differences in the
three models, which are related to the radial distribution, the mean occupation
function, and the velocity distribution of satellite galaxies inside halos. The
results suggest that galaxy 3PCFs can further help constrain the above
galaxy-halo relation and test theoretical models.

homology manifold structure group of a closed oriented connected
$\textit{topological}$ manifold, and prove its additivity. This higher rho

can be applied to define a higher rho invariant map on the homology manifold
structure group of a closed oriented connected $\textit{homology}$ manifold. As
an application, we use the additivity of the higher rho invariant map to study
non-rigidity of topological manifolds. More precisely, we give a lower bound
for the free rank of the $\textit{algebraically reduced}$ structure group of
$X$ by the number of torsion elements in $\pi_1 X$. Here the algebraic reduced
structure group of $X$ is the quotient of the topological structure group of

introduce a notion of homological higher rho invariant, which can be used to
detect many elements in the structure group of a closed oriented topological
manifold, even when the fundamental group of the manifold is torsion free. In
particular, we apply this homological higher rho invariant to show that the

those genes, one by one, would be unfeasible, new computational methods for
gene functions inference are needed. We present here a novel computational
approach for inferring biological function for a set of genes with previously
unknown function, given a set of genes with well-known information. This
approach is based on the premise that genes with similar behaviour should be
grouped together. This is known as the guilt-by-association principle. Thus, it
is possible to take advantage of clustering techniques to obtain groups of
unknown genes that are co-clustered with genes that have well-known semantic
information (GO annotations). Meaningful knowledge to infer unknown semantic
information can therefore be provided by these well-known genes. We provide a
method to explore the potential function of new genes according to those
currently annotated. The results obtained indicate that the proposed approach
could be a useful and effective tool when used by biologists to guide the
inference of biological functions for recently discovered genes. Our work sets
an important landmark in the field of identifying unknown gene functions

fitting. The supernovae (192 SNe) used in the analysis were extracted from
Joint-Light-curves-Analysis (JLA) compilation of high-redshift and nearby
supernovae which is the best one to date. The analysis is based on the
empirical fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light curve shapes and

correlated with the host galaxy type. The supernovae with lower stretch are
hosted mainly in elliptical and lenticular galaxies. No significant correlation
between SN Ia colour and host morphology was found.
  We also examine how the luminosities of SNe Ia change depending on host
galaxy morphology after stretch and colour corrections. Our results show that
in old stellar populations and low dust environments, the supernovae are
slightly fainter. SNe Ia in elliptical and lenticular galaxies have a higher
$\alpha$ (slope in luminosity-stretch) and $\beta$ (slope in luminosity-colour)
parameter than in spirals. However, the observed shift is at the 1-$\sigma$
uncertainty level and, therefore, can not be considered as significant.

  This paper introduces causal profiling. Unlike past profiling approaches,
causal profiling indicates exactly where programmers should focus their
optimization efforts, and quantifies their potential impact. Causal profiling
works by running performance experiments during program execution. Each
experiment calculates the impact of any potential optimization by virtually
speeding up code: inserting pauses that slow down all other code running
concurrently. The key insight is that this slowdown has the same relative
effect as running that line faster, thus ""virtually"" speeding it up.
  We present Coz, a causal profiler, which we evaluate on a range of
highly-tuned applications: Memcached, SQLite, and the PARSEC benchmark suite.
Coz identifies previously unknown optimization opportunities that are both
significant and targeted. Guided by Coz, we improve the performance of
Memcached by 9%, SQLite by 25%, and accelerate six PARSEC applications by as
much as 68%; in most cases, these optimizations involve modifying under 10

with what differential privacy does and does not guarantee. For example, the
definition prevents a strong adversary who knows all but one entry in the
database from further inferring about the last one. This strong adversary
assumption can be overlooked, resulting in misinterpretation of the privacy
guarantee of differential privacy.
  Herein we give an equivalent definition of privacy using mutual information
that makes plain some of the subtleties of differential privacy. The
mutual-information differential privacy is in fact sandwiched between
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy in
terms of its strength. In contrast to previous works using unconditional mutual
information, differential privacy is fundamentally related to conditional
mutual information, accompanied by a maximization over the database

yielding a simpler and more intuitive definition of differential privacy, is
that its properties are well understood. Several properties of differential

multiple messages to their respective receivers with different sets of side

a natural condition under which the corresponding index coding problem can be
decomposed into multiple interacting subproblems. The capacity region is
characterized in terms of the subproblem capacity regions combined in the same
product structure. The proof is based on dual uses of random coding---one for a
new multiletter characterization of the capacity region of a general index

of a new multiletter code of matching rates from a single-letter code via joint
typicality encoding. Several special cases are discussed that recover and

theoretically and the sample complexity is derived. Furthermore, the proposed
DMRL is extended to handle nonlinear IRL problems by assuming that the reward
function is in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and kernel DMRL

which greatly reduces the computation time. The performance of KDMRL is
extensively evaluated in two sets of experiments: grid world and track driving

with both model-based and model-free IRL methods and shows superior performance
on a nonlinear reward setting and competitive performance on a linear reward
setting in terms of expected value differences. Then we move on to more

finite representability for metric spaces. This allows us to develop a new
technique for comparing the generalized roundness of metric spaces. We
illustrate this technique in two different ways by applying it to Banach spaces
and metric trees. In the realm of Banach spaces we obtain results such as the
following: (1) if $\mathcal{U}$ is any ultrafilter and $X$ is any Banach space,
then the second dual $X^{\ast\ast}$ and the ultrapower $(X)_{\mathcal{U}}$ have
the same generalized roundness as $X$, and (2) no Banach space of positive
generalized roundness is uniformly homeomorphic to $c_{0}$ or $\ell_{p}$, $2 <
p < \infty$. Our technique also leads to the identification of new classes of
metric trees of generalized roundness one. In particular, we give the first
examples of metric trees of generalized roundness one that have finite
diameter. These results on metric trees provide a natural sequel to a paper of
Caffarelli, Doust and Weston. In addition, we show that metric trees of

  Networks Using UKF and EKF","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is commonly expected that future fifth generation (5G) networks will be
deployed with a high spatial density of access nodes (ANs) in order to meet the
envisioned capacity requirements of the upcoming wireless networks.
Densification is beneficial not only for communications but it also creates a
convenient infrastructure for highly accurate user node (UN) positioning.
Despite the fact that positioning will play an important role in future
networks, thus enabling a huge amount of location-based applications and
services, this great opportunity has not been widely explored in the existing
literature. Therefore, this paper proposes an unscented Kalman filter
(UKF)-based method for estimating directions of arrival (DoAs) and times of
arrival (ToA) at ANs as well as performing joint 3D positioning and network
synchronization in a network-centric manner. In addition to the proposed
UKF-based solution, the existing 2D extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solution
is extended to cover also realistic 3D positioning scenarios. Building on the
premises of 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs), the performance of both methods is
evaluated and analysed in terms of DoA and ToA estimation as well as
positioning and clock offset estimation accuracy, using the METIS map-based
ray-tracing channel model and 3D trajectories for vehicles and unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) through the Madrid grid. Based on the comprehensive numerical
evaluations, both proposed methods can provide the envisioned one meter 3D
positioning accuracy even in the case of unsynchronized 5G network while
simultaneously tracking the clock offsets of network elements with a
nanosecond-scale accuracy.

training data. This is used as a pretraining step for further supervised
learning in deep networks. Hence, understanding unsupervised learning is of
fundamental importance. Here, we study the unsupervised learning from a finite
number of data, based on the restricted Boltzmann machine learning. Our study
inspires an efficient message passing algorithm to infer the hidden feature,
and estimate the entropy of candidate features consistent with the data. Our
analysis reveals that the learning requires only a few data if the feature is
salient and extensively many if the feature is weak. Moreover, the entropy of
candidate features monotonically decreases with data size and becomes negative
(i.e., entropy crisis) before the message passing becomes unstable, suggesting
a discontinuous phase transition. In terms of convergence time of the message
passing algorithm, the unsupervised learning exhibits an easy-hard-easy
phenomenon as the training data size increases. All these properties are
reproduced in an approximate Hopfield model, with an exception that the entropy
crisis is absent, and only continuous phase transition is observed. This key
difference is also confirmed in a handwritten digits dataset. This study
deepens our understanding of unsupervised learning from a finite number of

gravitational energy. Here we demonstrate that heat from the tidal interaction
between the star and the young (and therefore inflated) planet can inhibit the
gas cooling and accretion. Quantitatively, we find that the growth of
super-Earth atmospheres halts for planets with periods of about 10 days,
provided that their initial eccentricities are of the order of 0.2. Thus, tidal
heating provides a robust and simple mechanism that can simultaneously explain
why these planets did not become gas giants and account for the deficit of
low-density planets closer to the star, where the tides are even stronger. We
suggest that tidal heating may be as important as other factors (such as the
nebula's lifetime and atmosphere evaporation) in shaping the observed
super-Earth population.

interaction. At low temperatures, excitons can form a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), enabling macroscopic phase coherence and superfluidity. An electronic
double layer (EDL), in which two parallel conducting layers are separated by an
insulator, is an ideal platform to realize a stable exciton BEC. In an EDL
under strong magnetic fields, electron-like and hole-like quasi-particles from
partially filled Landau levels (LLs) bind into excitons and condense. However,
in semiconducting double quantum wells, this magnetic-field-induced exciton BEC
has been observed only in sub-Kelvin temperatures due to the relatively strong
dielectric screening and large separation of the EDL. Here we report exciton
condensation in bilayer graphene EDL separated by a few atomic layers of
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Driving current in one graphene layer generates
a quantized Hall voltage in the other layer, signifying coherent superfluid
exciton transport. Owing to the strong Coulomb coupling across the atomically
thin dielectric, we find that quantum Hall drag in graphene appears at a
temperature an order of magnitude higher than previously observed in GaAs EDL.
The wide-range tunability of densities and displacement fields enables
exploration of a rich phase diagram of BEC across Landau levels with different
filling factors and internal quantum degrees of freedom. The observed robust
exciton superfluidity opens up opportunities to investigate various quantum
phases of the exciton BEC and design novel electronic devices based on
dissipationless transport.

efficient perfusion of the vascular tree. Shear-thinning is intimately related
to the dynamics and mutual interactions of red blood cells (RBCs), the major
constituents of blood. Our work explores RBCs dynamics under physiologically
relevant conditions of flow strength, outer fluid viscosity and volume
fraction. Our results contradict the current paradigm stating that RBCs should
align and elongate in the flow direction thanks to their membrane circulation
around their center of mass, reducing flow-lines disturbances. On the contrary,
we observe both experimentally and with simulations, rich morphological
transitions that relate to global blood rheology. For increasing shear
stresses, RBCs successively tumble, roll, deform into rolling stomatocytes and
finally adopt highly deformed and polylobed shapes even for semi-dilute volume
fractions analogous to microcirculatory values. Our study suggests that any
pathological change in plasma composition, RBCs cytosol viscosity or membrane
mechanical properties will impact the onset of shape transitions and should
play a central role in pathological blood rheology and flow behavior.

problem is represented as a Boson Sampling experiment with correlated Gaussian
input states. This molecular problem with temperature effect is intimately
related to the various versions of Boson Sampling sharing the similar
computational complexity. Here we provide a full description to this relation
in the context of Gaussian Boson Sampling. We find a hierarchical structure,
which illustrates the relationship among various Boson Sampling schemes.
Specifically, we show that every instance of Gaussian Boson Sampling with an
initial correlation can be simulated by an instance of Gaussian Boson Sampling
without initial correlation, with only a polynomial overhead. Since every
Gaussian state is associated with a thermal state, our result implies that
every sampling problem in molecular vibronic transitions, at any temperature,
can be simulated by Gaussian Boson Sampling associated with a product of vacuum
modes. We refer such a generalized Gaussian Boson Sampling motivated by the

region (broad-line region, BLR) that is composed of discrete clouds and
photoionized by the central ionizing continuum. The temporal behaviors of these
emission lines are blurred echoes of the continuum variations (i.e.,
reverberation mapping, RM) and directly reflect the structures and kinematic
information of BLRs through the so-called transfer function (also known as the
velocity-delay map). Based on the previous works of Rybicki & Press (1992) and

the transfer function for RM data, in which the transfer function is expressed
as a sum of a family of relatively displaced Gaussian response functions.
Therefore, arbitrary shapes of transfer functions associated with complicated
BLR geometry can be seamlessly included, enabling us to relax the presumption
of a specified transfer function frequently adopted in previous studies and to
let it be determined by observation data. We formulate our approach in a
previously well-established framework that incorporates the statistical
modeling of the continuum variations as a damped random walk process and takes
into account the long-term secular variations which are irrelevant to RM
signals. The Application to RM data shows the fidelity of our approach.

the mass-to-light ratios of disc and bulge were taken as free parameters, b)
the mass-to-light ratios were fixed in a narrow range according to the models

  To reproduce the possible observational features of the real galaxies we made
tests showing that the parameters of the three halo types change critically in
the cases of a lack of kinematic data in the central or peripheral areas and
for different spatial resolutions.
  We showed that due to the degeneracy between the central densities and the
radial scales of the dark haloes there are considerable uncertainties of their
concentrations estimates. Due to this reason it is also impossible to draw any
firm conclusion about universality of the dark halo column density based on
mass-modelling of even a high quality rotation curve. The problem is not solved
by fixing the density of baryonic matter.
  In contrast, the estimates of dark halo mass within optical radius are much
more reliable. We demonstrated that one can evaluate successfully the halo mass

different gravitational theories, by determining bounds on model parameters for
three different extensions of General Relativity, i.e. $k-$essence, $F(T)$ and
$f(R)$ theories. We expand each class of theories in powers of redshift $z$
around the present time, making no additional assumptions. This procedure is an
extension of previous work and can be seen as the most general approach for
testing extended theories of gravity with cosmography. In the case of $F(T)$
and $f(R)$ theories, we show that some assumptions on model parameters often
made in previous works are superfluous or unjustified. We use data from the
Union2.1 SN catalogue, BAO data and $H(z)$ differential age compilations, which
probe cosmology on different scales. We perform a Monte Carlo analysis using a
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion,
reporting 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ confidence levels. We perform two distinct
fits, first taking only data at $z<1$ and then for all $z$. We obtain the
corresponding parameter intervals, and find that the data is compatible the
$\Lambda$CDM limit of all three theories at the 1-$\sigma$ level, while still
compatible with quite a large portion of parameter space. We compare our
results to the truncated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, showing that the permitted
regions of coefficients are significantly modified and in general widened
compared to values reported in the existing literature. Finally, we test the
extended theories through the Bayesian selection criteria AIC and BIC.

maximizing the success probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) in a
cache-enabled heterogeneous network (HetNet) where a tier of multi-antenna
macro base stations (MBSs) is overlaid with a tier of helpers with caches.
Under the probabilistic caching framework, we resort to stochastic geometry
theory to derive the success probability and ASE. After finding the optimal
caching policies, we analyze the impact of critical system parameters and
compare the ASE with traditional HetNet where the MBS tier is overlaid by a
tier of pico BSs (PBSs) with limited-capacity backhaul. Analytical and
numerical results show that the optimal caching probability is less skewed
among helpers to maximize the success probability when the ratios of
MBS-to-helper density, MBS-to-helper transmit power, user-to-helper density, or
the rate requirement are small, but is more skewed to maximize the ASE in
general. Compared with traditional HetNet, the helper density is much lower
than the PBS density to achieve the same target ASE. The helper density can be
reduced by increasing cache size. With given total cache size within an area,
there exists an optimal helper node density that maximizes the ASE.

by Braess with totally asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs) on the edges.
The Braess paradox describes the counterintuitive situation in which adding an
edge to a road network leads to a user optimum with higher travel times for all
network users. Travel times on the TASEPs are nonlinear in the density, and
jammed states can occur due to the microscopic exclusion principle, leading to
a more realistic description of trafficlike transport on the network than in
previously studied linear macroscopic mathematical models. Furthermore, the
stochastic dynamics allows us to explore the effects of fluctuations on network
performance. We observe that for low densities, the added edge leads to lower
travel times. For slightly higher densities, the Braess paradox occurs in its
classical sense. At intermediate densities, strong fluctuations in the travel
times dominate the system's behavior due to links that are in a domain-wall
state. At high densities, the added link leads to lower travel times. We
present a phase diagram that predicts the system's state depending on the
global density and crucial path-length ratios.

address hard multimodal and deceptive problems, we extend ESTDA further by
substituting a single Student's t distribution with a mixture of Student's t
distributions. The resulting algorithm is named as estimation of mixture of

evaluated through extensive and in-depth numerical experiments using over a

proposed algorithms provide remarkably better performance than their Gaussian

undergoes a metal-insulator transition and a charge disproportionation reaction
2Fe$^{4+}$$\rightarrow$Fe$^{5+}$+Fe$^{3+}$. We observe that when Zr dopants
occupy a (001) layer, the band gap of the resulting solid solution increases to
0.93 eV due to a 2D Jahn-Teller type distortion, where FeO$_6$ cages on the
$xy$ plane elongate along $x$ and $y$ alternatively between neighboring Fe
sites. Furthermore, we show that the rock-salt ordering of the Fe$^{5+}$ and
Fe$^{3+}$ cations can be enhanced when the $B$-site dopants are arranged in a
(111) plane due to a collective steric effect that facilitates the size
discrepancy between the Fe$^{5+}$O$_6$ and Fe$^{3+}$O$_6$ octahedra and
therefore gives rise to a larger band gap. The enhanced charge
disproportionation in these solid solutions is verified by rigorously
calculating the oxidation states of the Fe cations with different octahedral
cage sizes. We therefore predict that the corresponding transition temperature
will increase due to the enhanced charge ordering and larger band gap. The
compositional, structural and electrical relationships exploited in this paper
can be extended to a variety of perovskites and non-perovskite oxides providing

to efficiently exploit available negative data by including all shifted

restricted to single-resolution feature maps, significantly limiting its
potential. In this paper, we go beyond the conventional DCF framework and
introduce a novel formulation for training continuous convolution filters. We
employ an implicit interpolation model to pose the learning problem in the

on three object tracking benchmarks: OTB-2015 (+5.1% in mean OP), Temple-Color

Additionally, our approach is capable of sub-pixel localization, crucial for
the task of accurate feature point tracking. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our learning formulation in extensive feature point tracking
experiments. Code and supplementary material are available at

We discuss the structural and temporal properties of human contact networks,

simple model, rooted on social attractiveness, able to reproduce them. We then
explore the behavior of dynamical processes running on top of temporal
networks, constituted by empirical face-to-face interactions, addressing in

Mat\'ern field. However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or
physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models
will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a
non-stationary model.
  We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the
established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the
physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on
viewing the Mat\'ern correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest
distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a
Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local
dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make
the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential
equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a
sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite.
  The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is
the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal
with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in
the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at
reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models
used in R-INLA.

homogeneous. This poses a challenge for the concept of chemical tagging since
it is based on the assumption of stars forming in the same star-forming

embedded low mass sources (class I stars), especially in the inner jet region.
We exploit multiwave spectroscopic observations to infer physical conditions of
the inner region of HH34 IRS, a prototypical class I jet. We use a deep
X-shooter spectrum ( lambda = 350-2300 nm, R between 8000 and 18000) detecting
lines with upper energies from 8000 to 31000 cm-1 . Statistical equilibrium and
ionization models are adopted to derive the jet main physical parameters. We
derive the physical conditions for the extended high velocity jet (HVC, V about
-100 km/s) and for the low velocity and compact gas (LVC, V about -20-50 \kms).
At the jet base (< 200 AU) the HVC is mostly neutral (x(e)< 0.1) and very dense
(n(H) > 5x10^5 cm-3). The LVC gas has the same density and A_V as the HVC, but
it is a factor of two colder. Iron abundance in the HVC is close to solar,
while it is 3 times subsolar in the LVC, suggesting an origin of the LVC gas
from a dusty disk. We infer a jet mass flux rate > 5x10^{-7} Mo/yr. We find
that the relationships between accretion luminosity and line luminosity derived
for T Tauri stars cannot be directly extended to class I sources surrounded by
reflection nebulae since the permitted lines are seen through scattered light.
An accretion rate of about 7\,10^{-6} Mo/yr is instead derived from an
empirical relationship connecting the mass accretion rate with L([OI])(HVC). In
conclusion, the HH34 IRS jet shares many properties with jets from active CTTs
stars. It is however denser as a consequence of the larger mass flux rate.
These findings suggest that the acceleration and excitation mechanisms in jets
are not influenced by evolution and are similar in CTTs and in still embedded
and highly accreting sources.

effect of a strong external stress. As a result, the presence of quick and
sharp transients in low permeability rocks is unveiled, i.e. the non-linear
Burgers solitons. We therefore propose that the actual transport process in
porous rocks for large signals is not the linear diffusion, but could be
governed by solitons. A test of an eventual presence of solitons in a rock is
here proposed, and then applied to Pierre Shale, Bearpaw Shale, Boom Clay and
Oznam-Mugu silt and clay. A quick analysis showing the presence of solitons for

disks have very different transition radii between their inner and outer
regions of $\sim$18.6 AU and $\sim$8.9 AU respectively. Assuming that they are
intrinsically circular and geometrically thin, we find that the two
circumstellar disks are parallel with each other and orthogonal in projection
to their respective ionized jets. Furthermore, the two disks are closely
aligned if not parallel with their circumbinary disk. Over an interval of
$\sim$10 yr, source B (possessing the circumsecondary disk) has moved
northwards with respect to and likely away from source A, indicating an orbital
motion in the same direction as the rotational motion of their circumbinary
disk. All the aforementioned elements therefore share the same axis for their
angular momentum, indicating that L1551 NE is a product of rotationally-driven
fragmentation of its parental core. Assuming a circular orbit, the relative
disk sizes are compatible with theoretical predictions for tidal truncation by
a binary system having a mass ratio of $\sim$0.2, in agreement with the
reported relative separations of the two protostars from the center of their

wind realistic configurations with different magnetic field orientations:
Mercury-Sun, Sun-Mercury, aligned with the magnetic axis of Mercury (Northward

In the Mercury-Sun (Sun-Mercury) simulation the Hermean magnetic field is
weakened in the South-East (North-East) of the magnetosphere leading to an
enhancement of the flows on the South (North) hemisphere. For a Northward
(Southward) orientation there is an enhancement (weakening) of the Hermean
magnetic field in the nose of the bow shock so the fluxes are reduced and
drifted to the poles (enhanced and drifted to the equator). If the solar wind
magnetic field is in the orbital plane the magnetosphere is tilted to the West

drifted to the East (West) in the Northern hemisphere and to the West (East) in
the Southern hemisphere.

Unruh state (the state describing BH evaporation). The RSET is type I at weak
field, and becomes type IV at $r\lesssim2.78M$. Then we use the RSET results to
explore violation of the weak and null Energy conditions. We find that both

find that the averaged weak energy condition is violated by a class of

numerically the BFKL equation with massive gluons and running coupling. The
spectrum of Regge singularities is discrete and the leading Pomeron has a
considerable dependence on nonperturbative effects, for which we use Higgs
mechanism as a model. We cross-checked this result with variational method and
confirmed the infrared sensitivity of leading Pomeron. This fact is related to
the infrared instability of the BFKL equation in QCD, with a running coupling.
The subleading poles have a mild sensitivity to the soft physics, and are well
described by known semiclassical methods. We also discuss the dependence on
various prescriptions of the running coupling arguments.

the net DMI increases linearly with the deposition temperature, indicating that
fine-tuning of the DMI may be achieved via the deposition conditions.

be fitted with a two-fold anisotropic s-wave gap function. The two-fold nature
of the gap symmetry is evident from the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference

argue that the gap inhomogeneity emerges as a result of intrinsic disorder in

unconventional superconductivity in Fe chalcogenides thinned down to a single

provides instant and useful feedback to students while solving programming
problems. Prutor stores, at regular intervals, the snapshots of students'
attempts to solve programming problems. These intermediate versions of the

Editors, Compilers, Compiler Options, etc.. This enables the students to focus
on solving only the programming problems. Apart from the code snapshots at
regular intervals, Prutor also collects other valuable data such as the time
taken by the students to solve the problems, the number of compile and
execution events, and the errors made. We have used this data in developing
intelligent tools for giving feedback to students, some of which are described
briefly in this paper. This system thus serves as a platform for tutoring as

"1609.02784","Marie Maros","Marie Maros and Joakim Jald\'en","ADMM for Distributed Dynamic Beamforming",,,,,"math.OC cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper shows the capability the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) has to track, in a distributed manner, the optimal down-link
beam-forming solution in a multiple input multiple output (MISO) multi-cell
network given a dynamic channel. Each time the channel changes, ADMM is allowed
to perform one algorithm iteration. In order to implement the proposed scheme,
the base stations are not required to exchange channel state information (CSI),
but will require to exchange interference values once. We show ADMM's tracking
ability in terms of the algorithm's Lyapunov function given that the primal and
dual solutions to the convex optimization problem at hand can be understood as
a continuous mapping from the problem's parameters. We show that this holds
true even considering that the problem looses strong convexity when it is made
distributed. We then show that these requirements hold for the down-link, and
consequently up-link, beam-forming case. Numerical examples corroborating the
theoretical findings are also provided.
