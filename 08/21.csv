on additively separable and linear treatments of statistics that capture a
node's position in the network. This enables us to provide a taxonomy of
centrality measures that distills them to varying on two dimensions: (i) which
information they make use of about nodes' positions, and (ii) how that
information is weighted as a function of distance from the node in question.
The three sorts of information about nodes' positions that are usually used --
which we refer to as ""nodal statistics"" -- are the paths from a given node to
other nodes, the walks from a given node to other nodes, and the geodesics
between other nodes that include a given node. Using such statistics on nodes'
positions, we also characterize the types of trees such that centrality
measures all agree, and we also discuss the properties that identify some
path-based centrality measures.

Main text and figures are updated",,"10.1038/nphys4140",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatially indirect excitons can be created when an electron and a hole,
confined to separate layers of a double quantum well system, bind to form a
composite Boson. Because there is no recombination pathway such excitons are
long lived making them accessible to transport studies. Moreover, the ability
to independently tune both the intralayer charge density and interlayer
electron-hole separation provides the capability to reach the low-density,
strongly interacting regime where a BEC-like phase transition into a superfluid
ground state is anticipated. To date, transport signatures of the superfluid
condensate phase have been seen only in quantum Hall bilayers composed of
double well GaAs heterostructures. Here we report observation of the exciton
condensate in the quantum Hall effect regime of double layer structures of
bilayer graphene. Correlation between the layers is identified by quantized
Hall drag appearing at matched layer densities, and the dissipationless nature
of the phase is confirmed in the counterflow geometry. Independent tuning of
the layer densities and interlayer bias reveals a selection rule involving both
the orbital and valley quantum number between the symmetry-broken states of
bilayer graphene and the condensate phase, while tuning the layer imbalance
stabilizes the condensate to temperatures in excess of 4K. Our results
establish bilayer graphene quantum wells as an ideal system in which to study
the rich phase diagram of strongly interacting Bosonic particles in the solid
state.

determined a computationally robust implementation of the convolution of a
Gaussian with a sinc instrumental line shape which avoids arithmetic overflows.

at low spectral resolution (R less than 5000). We have also designed the

lines shows that the Main Ring and the Central Lobe are two different shells
with different expansion velocities. We have also derived deep and spatially

  arXiv:1511.00139",,,,"q-bio.BM math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among the unsolved problems in computational biology, protein folding is one
of the most interesting challenges. To study this folding, tools like neural
networks and genetic algorithms have received a lot of attention, mainly due to
the NP-completeness of the folding process. The background idea that has given
rise to the use of these algorithms is obviously that the folding process is
predictable. However, this important assumption is disputable as chaotic
properties of such a process have been recently highlighted. In this paper,
which is an extension of a former work accepted to the 2011 International Joint
Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN11), the topological behavior of a
well-known dynamical system used for protein folding prediction is evaluated.
It is mathematically established that the folding dynamics in the 2D
hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) square lattice model, simply called ""the 2D model""
in this document, is indeed a chaotic dynamical system as defined by Devaney.
Furthermore, the chaotic behavior of this model is qualitatively and
quantitatively deepened, by studying other mathematical properties of disorder,
namely: the indecomposability, instability, strong transitivity, and constants
of expansivity and sensitivity. Some consequences for both biological paradigms
and structure prediction using this model are then discussed. In particular, it
is shown that some neural networks seems to be unable to predict the evolution
of this model with accuracy, due to its complex behavior.

structure from the corrupted real data. Typically, the specific structure is
assumed to be low rank, which holds for a wide range of data, such as images
and videos. Meanwhile, the corruption is assumed to be sparse. In the
literature, such a problem is known as Robust Principal Component Analysis
(RPCA), which usually recovers the low rank structure by approximating the rank
function with a nuclear norm and penalizing the error by an $\ell_1$-norm.
Although RPCA is a convex formulation and can be solved effectively, the
introduced norms are not tight approximations, which may cause the solution to
deviate from the authentic one. Therefore, we consider here a non-convex
relaxation, consisting of a Schatten-$p$ norm and an $\ell_q$-norm that promote
low rank and sparsity respectively. We derive a proximal iteratively reweighted
algorithm (PIRA) to solve the problem. Our algorithm is based on an alternating
direction method of multipliers, where in each iteration we linearize the
underlying objective function that allows us to have a closed form solution. We
demonstrate that solutions produced by the linearized approximation always
converge and have a tighter approximation than the convex counterpart.
Experimental results on benchmarks show encouraging results of our approach.

involved. With the steady growth of such systems, the probability of failures
increases, which necessitates scalable fault-tolerant agreement protocols. The
most common practical agreement protocol, for such scenarios, is leader-based
atomic broadcast. In this work, we propose AllConcur, a distributed system that
provides agreement through a leaderless concurrent atomic broadcast algorithm,
thus, not suffering from the bottleneck of a central coordinator. In AllConcur,
all components exchange messages concurrently through a logical overlay network
that employs early termination to minimize the agreement latency. Our
implementation of AllConcur supports standard sockets-based TCP as well as
high-performance InfiniBand Verbs communications. AllConcur can handle up to
135 million requests per second and achieves 17x higher throughput than today's
standard leader-based protocols, such as Libpaxos. Thus, AllConcur is highly
competitive with regard to existing solutions and, due to its decentralized
approach, enables hitherto unattainable system designs in a variety of fields.

decrease in the number of available conduction channels that must conserve
their momenta transverse to the interface. When phonon-phonon interactions are
included, the added layer is seen to aid conductance when the decrease in
resistances at the contact-layer boundaries compensate for the additional layer
resistance. For the particular systems explored in this work, the maximum
conductance happens when the layer mass is close to the geometric mean of the
contact masses. The surprising result, usually associated with coherent
antireflection coatings, follows from a monotonic increase in the boundary
resistance with the interface mass ratio. This geometric mean condition readily
extends to a compositionally graded interfacial layer with an exponentially
varying mass that generates the thermal equivalent of a broadband impedance

extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's
components interact. This general task is called community detection in
networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data.
It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by
their ability to find so-called ""ground truth"" communities. This works well in
synthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are
formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no
planted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to
treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground
truth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that
treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We
prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a
general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there
can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks.
However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still
have value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network
structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by
introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship
between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We
demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and
for multiple types of metadata and community structure.

(SPH) is solved. A novel error analysis is developed in $n$-dimensional space
using the Poisson summation formula, which enables the treatment of the kernel
and particle approximation errors in combined fashion. New consistency integral
relations are derived for the particle approximation which correspond to the
cosine Fourier transform of the classically known consistency conditions for
the kernel approximation. The functional dependence of the error bounds on the
SPH interpolation parameters, namely the smoothing length $h$ and the number of
particles within the kernel support ${\cal{N}}$ is demonstrated explicitly from
which consistency conditions are seen to follow naturally. As
${\cal{N}}\to\infty$, the particle approximation converges to the kernel
approximation independently of $h$ provided that the particle mass scales with
$h$ as $m\propto h^{\beta}$, with $\beta >n$. This implies that as $h\to 0$,
the joint limit $m\to 0$, ${\cal{N}}\to\infty$, and $N\to\infty$ is necessary
for complete convergence to the continuum, where $N$ is the total number of
particles. The analysis also reveals the presence of a dominant error term of
the form $(\ln {\cal{N}})^{n}/{\cal{N}}$, which tends asymptotically to
$1/{\cal{N}}$ when ${\cal{N}}\gg 1$, as it has long been conjectured based on
the similarity between the SPH and the quasi-Monte Carlo estimates.

interactions, however there is growing tension between the SM and observations
(neutrino oscillations, dark matter, dark energy, baryogenesis, among others).
There is no reason to expect the validity of the ad hoc SM to remain intact at
energy scales above a few TeV, thus a more fundamental theory will almost
certainly be required.
  Motivated by these considerations, we investigate a Supersymmetric version of
a natural extension of the SM, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model, that is obtained by
gauging the accidental B-L symmetry that exists in the ordinary SM. The
Supersymmetric $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended SM can resolve the neutrino mass problem,
the dark matter problem, the hierarchy problem, and provides a mechanism for
establishing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe.
  When we include quantum corrections to the Higgs potential of the model, we
find that Radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking occurs through the interplay
between large Majorana Yukawa couplings and SUSY breaking masses, and the SM
neutrino masses arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism. We deduce from the
form RGEs that $B-L$ will be broken near the TeV scale when the Majorana Yukawa
couplings are of order 0.5, leading to TeV scale right-handed neutrinos, which
could be accessible at the LHC. We discuss the different vacua of the theory
and the viability of a right-handed neutrino dark matter candidate in the
R-parity conserving and violating sectors. A new $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity is
postulated in the R-parity violating sector in which case the lightest right
handed neutrino becomes a viable Dark Matter candidate in addition to the
gravitino.

recent years. However, existing online feature selection methods evaluate
features individually and ignore the underlying structure of feature stream.
For instance, in image analysis, features are generated in groups which
represent color, texture and other visual information. Simply breaking the
group structure in feature selection may degrade performance. Motivated by this
fact, we formulate the problem as an online group feature selection. The
problem assumes that features are generated individually but there are group
structure in the feature stream. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that the correlation among feature stream has been considered in the
online feature selection process. To solve this problem, we develop a novel
online group feature selection method named OGFS. Our proposed approach
consists of two stages: online intra-group selection and online inter-group
selection. In the intra-group selection, we design a criterion based on
spectral analysis to select discriminative features in each group. In the
inter-group selection, we utilize a linear regression model to select an
optimal subset. This two-stage procedure continues until there are no more
features arriving or some predefined stopping conditions are met. %Our method

to identify optical AGN. We examine the uniqueness and overlap of the AGN
identified at different wavelengths. There is a strong bias against identifying
AGN at any wavelength in low mass galaxies, and an additional bias against
identifying IR AGN in the most massive galaxies. AGN hosts span a wide range of
star formation rate (SFR), similar to inactive galaxies once stellar mass
selection effects are accounted for. However, we find (at $\sim 2-3\sigma$
significance) that IR AGN are in less dusty galaxies with relatively higher SFR
and optical AGN in dusty galaxies with relatively lower SFR. X-ray AGN
selection does not display a bias with host galaxy SFR. These results are
consistent with those from larger studies at lower redshifts. Within
star-forming galaxies, once selection biases are accounted for, we find AGN in
galaxies with similar physical properties as inactive galaxies, with no
evidence for AGN activity in particular types of galaxies. This is consistent
with AGN being fueled stochastically in any star-forming host galaxy. We do not
detect a significant correlation between SFR and AGN luminosity for individual
AGN hosts, which may indicate the timescale difference between the growth of
galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

unknown. We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness.
Modelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce
that fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending
axes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to
bend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between
bending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in
stiffness. Using analysis of a 3D reconstruction of a Mackerel (Scomber
japonicus) pectoral fin, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is
expected to span by changing curvature. The 3D reconstruction shows that, even
in its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the
fin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. Since the
ability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is
limited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the
fish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results provide mechanical
underpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis that the spanned
range of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the ecological niche
of the fish.

as the aluminum source while hexane and toluene were used as the solvents. The
films were deposited at 475oC at different precursor concentrations. It was
observed that the choice of solvent has no effect on the surface morphology,

close enthalpy of vaporisation ({\Delta}H) values and uniformity of the film,
irrespective of the growth conditions, showed that hexane was a better solvent
for ASB than toluene. A hybrid mode of vapour deposition and vapour
condensation model for thin film growth is proposed where five different
mechanisms lead to a solid film formation. These include vapour phase
deposition under low arrival rate, vapour phase deposition under high arrival
rate, Leidenfrost aerosol formation, heterogeneous particle formation and
liquid droplet impingement. The important parameter that needs to be controlled
is the precursor flux arrival rate which can be controlled by varying the
precursor concentration, use of a solvent with a low {\Delta}H and the presence
of a shield over the substrate, which influences the surface morphology and the
growth rate of the films.

this paper we explore the deep residual learning on the task of volumetric

First, we propose a deep voxelwise residual network, referred as VoxResNet,
which borrows the spirit of deep residual learning in 2D image recognition
tasks, and is extended into a 3D variant for handling volumetric data. Second,
an auto-context version of VoxResNet is proposed by seamlessly integrating the
low-level image appearance features, implicit shape information and high-level

in dealing with volumetric data. We believe this work unravels the potential of
3D deep learning to advance the recognition performance on volumetric image

variables (focusing in the Ising case), introducing a prior on the candidate
moves in a Metropolis-Hastings scheme which can significantly reduce the
rejection rate, called the reduced-rejection-rate (RRR) method. The method
employs same probability distribution for the choice of the moves as
rejection-free schemes such as the method proposed by Bortz, Kalos and Lebowitz
(BKL) [Bortz et al. J.Comput.Phys. 1975]; however, it uses it as a prior in an
otherwise standard Metropolis scheme: it is thus not fully rejection-free, but
in a wide range of scenarios it is nearly so. This allows to extend the method
to cases for which rejection-free schemes become inefficient, in particular
when the graph connectivity is not sparse, but the energy can nevertheless be
expressed as a sum of two components, one of which is computed on a sparse
graph and dominates the measure. As examples of such instances, we demonstrate
that the method yields excellent results when performing Monte Carlo
simulations of quantum spin models in presence of a transverse field in the
Suzuki-Trotter formalism, and when exploring the so-called robust ensemble
which was recently introduced in Baldassi et al. [PNAS 2016]. Our code for the
Ising case is publicly available [https://github.com/carlobaldassi/RRRMC.jl],

We develop an analytic theory for the evolution of explosions within a stellar
wind, and verify it using a hydrodynamic code. We show that such explosions can
evolve in one of three possible morphologies. Using these results we discuss
the association between the two SNRs (SGR East and SGR A's bipolar radio/X-ray
Lobes) and the two neutron stars (the cannonball and SGR J1745-2900) near the
galactic center. We show that, given the morphologies of the SNR and positions
of the neutron stars, the only possible association is between SGR A's bipolar
radio/X-ray Lobes and SGR J1745-2900. The compact object created in the
explosion of SGR East remains undetected, and the SNR of the supernova that
created the cannonball has already disappeared.

$Ax=b$ with $b$ contaminated by a white noise, Lanczos bidiagonalization based
LSQR and its mathematically equivalent CGLS are most commonly used. They have
intrinsic regularizing effects, where the number $k$ of iterations plays the
role of regularization parameter. However, hitherto there has been no answer to
the long-standing fundamental concern of Bj\""{o}rck and Eld\'{e}n in 1979: {\em
for which kinds of problems LSQR and CGLS can find best possible regularized
solutions}? Here a best possible regularized solution means that it is at least
as accurate as the best regularized solution obtained by the truncated singular
value decomposition (TSVD) method or by standard-form Tikhonov regularization
and cannot be improved under certain conditions. In this paper we make a
detailed analysis on the regularization of LSQR for severely, moderately and
mildly ill-posed problems. For the first two kinds of problems, we prove that
LSQR finds best possible solutions at semi-convergence and the following
results hold until semi-convergence: (i) the $k$-step Lanczos bidiagonalization
always generates a near best rank $k$ approximation to $A$; (ii) the $k$ Ritz
values always approximate the first $k$ large singular values of $A$ in natural
order; (iii) the $k$-step LSQR always captures the $k$ dominant SVD components
of $A$; (iv) the diagonals and subdiagonals of the bidiagonal matrices
generated by Lanczos bidiagonalization decay as fast as the singular values of
$A$. However, for the third kind of problem, the above results do not hold
generally. We also analyze the regularization of the other two Krylov solvers
LSMR and CGME, proving that LSMR has similar regularizing effects to LSQR for
each kind of problem and both are superior to CGME. Numerical experiments
confirm our theory on LSQR.

known to be one of the mechanisms responsible for magnetic instability of the

certain elements stabilizes it to an antiferromagnetic state below the Curie
temperature via a first-order second phase transition. In the present work, we
seek any direct relation between the $f-d$ hybridization and the second
transition by measuring primarily dc magnetization and Ce M$_{4,5}$ edge x-ray
absorption spectra of Ce(Fe$_{1-x}$M$_x$)$_2$ pseudobinaries, with M = Cr, Ag

also performed essentially to monitor the quality of the samples. Whereas Cr
impurity is found to cause the second transition, Ag and Au apparently do not
induce any. In the former, the Curie and second transition temperatures vary
systematically, but differently, with $x$. Our results imply that there is a
definite proportionality between the $x$ dependences of the second transition
temperature and the $f-d$ hybridization strength estimated qualitatively from
the absorption spectra.

samples of a smaller size, for which the model cannot be rejected. We use a
model adequacy test to choose a bootstrap size with limited probability of
rejecting the model and perform inference for samples of this size based on a

context, the goal is to optimize the Quality of Service (QoS) and cost
objectives for the cloud-based services. However, the difficulty lies in the
facts that these objectives, e.g., throughput and cost, can be naturally
conflicted, and the QoS of cloud-based services often interfere due to the
shared infrastructure in cloud. Consequently, dynamic and effective trade-off
decision making of autoscaling in the cloud is necessary, yet challenging. In
particular, it is even harder to achieve well-compromised trade-offs, where the
decision largely improves the majority of the objectives, while causing
relatively small degradations to others. In this paper, we present a
self-adaptive decision making approach for autoscaling in the cloud. It is
capable to adaptively produce autoscaling decisions that lead to
well-compromised trade-offs without heavy human intervention. We leverage on
ant colony inspired multi-objective optimization for searching and optimizing
the trade-offs decisions, the result is then filtered by compromise-dominance,
a mechanism that extracts the decisions with balanced improvements in the
trade-offs. We experimentally compare our approach to four state-of-the-arts
autoscaling approaches: rule, heuristic, randomized and multi-objective genetic
algorithm based solutions. The results reveal the effectiveness of our approach
over the others, including better quality of trade-offs and significantly
smaller violation of the requirements.

field approach is suggested. The extension to the discrete case makes use of
the strong relation HPF-based planning has to connectionist artificial
intelligence (AI). Connectionist AI systems are networks of simple,
interconnected processors running in parallel within the confines of the
environment in which the planning action is to be synthesized. It is not hard
to see that such a paradigm naturally lends itself to planning on weighted
graphs where the processors may be seen as the vertices of the graph and the
relations among them as its edges. Electrical networks are an effective
realization of connectionist AI. The utility of the discrete HPF (DHPF)
approach is demonstrated in three ways. First, the capability of the DHPF
approach to generate new, abstract, planning techniques is demonstrated by
constructing a novel, efficient, optimal, discrete planning method called the
M* algorithm. Also, its ability to augment the capabilities of existing
planners is demonstrated by suggesting a generic solution to the lower bound
problem faced by the A* algorithm. The DHPF approach is shown to be useful in
solving specific planning problems in communication. It is demonstrated that
the discrete HPF paradigm can support routing on-the-fly while the network is
still in a transient state. It is shown by simulation that if a path to the
target always exist and the switching delays in the routers are negligible, a
packet will reach its destination despite the changes in the network which may
simultaneously take place while the packet is being routed.

untrusted and even hostile environments, sensor nodes are prone to node
compromise attacks. Hence, an end-to-end secure aggregation approach is
required to ensure a healthy data reception. In this paper, we propose two
layers for secure data aggregation in sensor networks. Firstly, we provide an
end-to-end encryption scheme that supports operations over cypher-text. It is
based on elliptic curve cryptography that exploits a smaller key size, allows
the use of higher number of operations on cypher-texts, and prevents the
distinction between two identical texts from their cryptograms. Secondly, we
propose a new watermarking-based authentication that enables sensor nodes to
ensure the identity of other nodes they are communicating with. Our experiments
show that our hybrid approach of secure data aggregation enhances the security,
significantly reduces computation and communication overhead, and can be
practically implemented in on-the-shelf sensor platforms.

vertex-shifts on unimodular random networks. Each such vertex-shift partitions
the vertices into a collection of connected components and foils. The latter
are discrete analogues the stable manifold of the dynamics. The classification
is based on the cardinality of the connected components and foils. Up to an
event of zero probability, there are three classes of foliations in a connected
component: F/F (with finitely many finite foils), I/F (infinitely many finite
foils), and I/I (infinitely many infinite foils). An infinite connected
component of the graph of a vertex-shift on a random network forms an infinite
tree with one selected end which is referred to as an Eternal Family Tree. Such
trees can be seen as stochastic extensions of branching processes. Unimodular
Eternal Family Trees can be seen as extensions of critical branching processes.
The class of offspring-invariant Eternal Family Trees, which is introduced in
the paper, allows one to analyze dynamics on networks which are not necessarily
unimodular. These can be seen as extensions of non-necessarily critical
branching processes. Several construction techniques of Eternal Family Trees
are proposed, like the joining of trees or moving the root to a far descendant.
Eternal Galton-Watson Trees and Eternal Multi-type Galton-Watson Trees are also
introduced as special cases of Eternal Family Trees satisfying additional

backgrounds which are conformally ultrastatic, with a time-dependent conformal
factor. As it is typical for field theories, there is an infinite ambiguity in
the Fock representation of the canonical anticommutation relations. Different
choices may lead to unitarily inequivalent theories that describe different
physics. To remove this ambiguity one usually requires that the vacuum be
invariant under the unitary transformations that implement the symmetries of
the equations of motion. However, in non-stationary backgrounds, where time
translation is not a symmetry transformation, the requirement of vacuum
invariance is in general not enough to fix completely the Fock representation.
We show that this problem is overcome in the considered scenario by demanding,
in addition, a unitarily implementable quantum dynamics. The combined
imposition of these conditions selects a unique family of equivalent Fock
representations. Moreover, one also obtains an essentially unique splitting of
the time variation of the Dirac field into an explicit dependence on the
background scale factor and a quantum evolution of the corresponding creation
and annihilation operators.

between single photons. Light interacting with motion in an optomechanical
system can sense minute fluctuations in displacement, and also impart a force
via radiation pressure. Taken together, these two effects mean that two photons
can ""sense"" each other's presence in an interaction mediated by motion. It is
accepted that for an optomechanical system to mediate strong interactions
between single photons, the mechanical system must respond before the photon is
lost ($\omega_m > \kappa$), and the radiation pressure force must generate a
displacement large enough to change the optical properties of the system ($g_0
> \kappa$). The challenge of achieving this ""vacuum strong coupling"" has
prevented experiments from demonstrating single-photon interactions. In this
work we show that by adding a coherent feedback channel to a slow mechanical
system ($\omega_m < \kappa$) that is weakly nonlinear ($g_0 < \kappa$), two
spatially separated single photons can be made to effectively interact with
each other deterministically through the mechanical motion of a resonator. To
numerically analyze our system, we must solve Schr\""odinger's equation for the
state of an optomechanical system coupled to a long waveguide feeback channel.
We implement a matrix product state approach to keep track of and evolve the
complete quantum state of the system in an efficient way. We analyze the
process semiclassically and then solve the full quantum dynamics numerically to
find a cross-over between the semiclassical and quantum regimes of
optomechanics. Finally we analyze the experimental prospects for implementing
this protocol.

quantized by means of a hybrid approach that combines loop quantization
techniques with standard quantum field theory methods. This approach is based
on a splitting of the phase space in a homogeneous sector, formed by global,
zero-modes, and an inhomogeneous sector, formed by the remaining, infinite
number of modes, that describe the local degrees of freedom. Then, the hybrid
quantization is attained by adopting a loop representation for the homogeneous
gravitational sector, while a Fock representation is used for the
inhomogeneities. The zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint operator couples
the homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors. The hybrid approach, therefore, is
expected to provide a suitable quantum theory in regimes where the main quantum
effects of the geometry are those affecting the zero-modes, while the
inhomogeneities, still being quantum, can be treated in a more conventional
way. This hybrid strategy was first proposed for the simplest cosmological
midisuperspaces: the Gowdy models, and it has been later applied to the case of
cosmological perturbations. This paper reviews the construction and main
applications of hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology

being at the FL results in unusual angular dependences of the out-of-plane

background) with a barotropic equation of state in Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in
the presence of phase space deformation effects. Such a deformation is
introduced as a particular type of non-commutativity between phase space
coordinates. For the commutative case, it has been shown in the literature [1],
that the dust collapse in BD theory leads to the formation of a spacetime
singularity which is covered by an event horizon. In comparison to general
relativity (GR), the authors concluded that the final state of black holes in
BD theory is identical to the GR case but differs from GR during the dynamical
evolution of the collapse process. However, the presence of non-commutative
effects influences the dynamics of the collapse scenario and consequently a
non-singular evolution is developed in the sense that a bounce emerges at a
minimum radius, after which an expanding phase begins. Such a behavior is
observed for positive values of the BD coupling parameter. For large positive
values of the BD coupling parameter, when non-commutative effects are present,
the dynamics of collapse process differs from the GR case. Finally, we show
that for negative values of the BD coupling parameter, the singularity is
replaced by an oscillatory bounce occurring at a finite time, with the
frequency of oscillation and amplitude being damped at late times.

Our study is based on the matching of solutions on the boundary and on the

magnetic field is considered, and the critical temperature is obtained in terms
of the charge density, the dimensionality, and the power-Maxwell exponent.
Then, a magnetic field is turned on in the $d$-dimensional bulk which can
influence the $(d-1)$-dimensional holographic superconductor at the boundary.
The phase behavior of the corresponding holographic superconductor is obtained
by computing the upper critical magnetic field in the presence of power-Maxwell
electrodynamics, characterized by the power exponent $q$. Interestingly, it is
observed that in the presence of magnetic field, the physically acceptable
phase behavior of the holographic superconductor is obtained for $q={d}/{4}$,
