development of new techniques. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the
information contained in their classical configurations, whose computation do
not require full knowledge of the wavefunction. Inspired by holographic
duality, we investigated the entanglement properties of the classical
configurations (snapshots) of the Potts model by introducing an ansatz ensemble
of random fractal images. By virtue of the central limit theorem, our ansatz
accurately reproduces the entanglement spectra of actual Potts snapshots
without any fine-tuning of parameters or artificial restrictions on ensemble
choice. It provides a microscopic interpretation of the results of previous
studies, which established a relation between the scaling behavior of snapshot
entropy and the critical exponent. More importantly, it elucidates the role of
ensemble disorder in restoring conformal invariance, an aspect previously
ignored. Away from criticality, the breakdown of scale invariance leads to a
renormalization of the parameter $\Sigma$ in the random fractal ansatz, whose
variation can be used as an alternative determination of the critical exponent.
We conclude by providing a recipe for the explicit construction of fractal unit
cells consistent with a given scaling exponent.

pieces of avionics equipment supported by a wired technology, with stringent
reliability and safety requirements. If the inter-connecting wires are
physically secured so that a malicious user cannot access them directly, then
this enforces (at least partially) the security of the network. However,
substituting the wired network with a wireless network - which in this context
is referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN) - brings a number of new
challenges related to assurance, reliability, and security. The AWN thus has to
ensure that it provides at least the required security and safety levels
offered by the equivalent wired network. Providing a wired-equivalent security
for a communication channel requires the setting up of a strong, secure
(encrypted) channel between the entities that are connected to the AWN. In this
paper, we propose three approaches to establish such a secure channel based on
(i) pre-shared keys, (ii) trusted key distribution, and (iii) key-sharing
protocols. For each of these approaches, we present two representative protocol
variants. These protocols are then implemented as part of a demo AWN and they
are then compared based on performance measurements. Most importantly, we have
evaluated these protocols based on security and operational requirements that
we define in this paper for an AWN.

  Networks","10 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, IEEE DASC",,,,"cs.CR cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Avionics networks rely on a set of stringent reliability and safety
requirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired
technology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology
simplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can
be safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network,
and the fact that it is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node
into the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently
under development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in
the complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction
in the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the
capacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts
such as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing
these benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are
at minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper,
we propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated
security and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main
objectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance
that all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their
internal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to
establish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to
provide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for
both the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a
cold and/or warm restart of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and
performance measurements are presented based on this implementation. In
addition, we formally verify our proposed protocol using CasperFDR.

addition to the MRT-LB equation of a density distribution function for the

non-equilibrium effects are incorporated into the model by adding source terms

mean temperature and zonal wind to their anomalies and external forcing is used
to accurately quantify the strength of the eddy-jet feedback associated with
the annular mode in an idealized GCM. Following a simple feedback model, the
results confirm the presence of a positive eddy-jet feedback in the annular
mode dynamics, with a feedback strength of 0.137 day$^{-1}$ in the idealized
GCM. Statistical methods proposed by earlier studies to quantify the feedback
strength are evaluated against results from the LRF. It is argued that the
mean-state-independent eddy forcing reduces the accuracy of these statistical
methods because of the quasi-oscillatory nature of the eddy forcing. A new
method is proposed to approximate the feedback strength as the regression
coefficient of low-pass filtered eddy forcing onto low-pass filtered annular
mode index, which converges to the value produced by the LRF when timescales
longer than 200 days are used for the low-pass filtering. Applying the new
low-pass filtering method to the reanalysis data, the feedback strength in the
Southern annular mode is found to be 0.121 day$^{-1}$, which is presented as an
improvement over previous estimates. This work also highlights the importance
of using sub-daily data in the analysis by showing the significant contribution
of medium-scale waves of periods less than 2 days to the annular mode dynamics,
which was under-appreciated in most of previous research. The present study
provides a framework to quantify the eddy-jet feedback strength in models and
reanalysis data.

planning. In order to address the DC-Checking problem, in [Comin and Rizzi,
TIME 2015] we introduced epsilon-DC (a refined, more realistic, notion of DC),
and provided an algorithmic solution to it. The epsilon-DC notion is
interesting per se, and the epsilon-DC-Checking algorithm in [Comin and Rizzi,
TIME 2015] rests on the assumption that the reaction-time satisfies epsilon >
0; leaving unsolved the question of what happens when epsilon = 0. In this
work, we introduce and study pi-DC, a sound notion of DC with an instantaneous
reaction-time (i.e. one in which the planner can react to any observation at
the same instant of time in which the observation is made). Firstly, we
demonstrate by a counter-example that pi-DC is not equivalent to 0-DC, and that
0-DC is actually inadequate for modeling DC with an instantaneous
reaction-time. This shows that the main results obtained in our previous work
do not apply directly, as they were formulated, to the case of epsilon=0.
Motivated by this observation, as a second contribution, our previous tools are
extended in order to handle pi-DC, and the notion of ps-tree is introduced,
also pointing out a relationship between pi-DC and HyTN-Consistency. Thirdly, a
simple reduction from pi-DC-Checking to DC-Checking is identified. This allows
us to design and to analyze the first sound-and-complete pi-DC-Checking
procedure. Remarkably, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm remains
(pseudo) singly-exponential in the number of propositional letters. Finally, it
is observed that the technique can be leveraged to actually reduce from pi-DC
to 1-DC, this allows us to further improve the exponents in the time complexity

evolution using a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy
from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. In the simulation, stars
older than 6 Gyr were formed in a chaotic, bursty mode and have the largest
vertical scale heights (1.5-2.5 kpc) by z=0, while stars younger than 6 Gyr
were formed in a relatively calm, stable disk. The vertical scale height
increases with stellar age at all radii, because (1) stars that formed earlier
were thicker ""at birth"", and (2) stars were kinematically heated to an even
thicker distribution after formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the
outer disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical
age gradients and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity
gradient is neg- ative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disk height |Z|,
and turns positive above |Z|~1.5kpc. The vertical metallicity gradient is
negative at all radii, but is steeper at smaller radii. These trends broadly
agree with observations in the Milky Way and can be naturally understood from
the age gradients. The vertical stellar density profile can be well-described
by two components, with scale heights 200-500 pc and 1-1.5 kpc, respectively.
The thick component is a mix of stars older than 4 Gyr which formed through a
combination of several mechanisms. Our results also demonstrate that it is
possible to form a thin disk in cosmological simulations even with strong
stellar feedback.

Raman scattering by employing the tip of a probe interacting, in ultra close
proximity, with a surface. Although a general understanding of the TERS process
is still to be fully elucidated, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) feedback
is often applied with success in TERS to keep a noble metal probe in intimate
proximity with a noble metal substrate. Since such STM TERS is a common
modality, the possible implications of plasmonic fields that may be induced by
the tunneling process are investigated and reported. In addition, TERS of a 2D
resonant molecular system, a MoS2 bilayer crystal and a 2D non-resonant, lipid
molecular bilayer is compared. Data with multiple excitation wavelengths and
surfaces for the resonant system in the near- (TERS) and far-field regimes are
reported. An interpretation based on weak coupling interactions within the
framework of conventional resonance Raman scattering can explain the observed
TERS enhancements. The non-resonant molecular lipid system, on the other hand,
requires strong coupling for a full understanding of the reported observations.

Consequently, sampling rate reduction is of high practical value in SAR
imaging. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, equivalent to the
well-known Range-Doppler method, to process SAR data using the Fourier series
coefficients of the raw signals. We then demonstrate how to exploit the
algorithm features to reduce sampling rate in both range and azimuth axes and
process the signals at sub-Nyquist rates, by using compressed sensing (CS)
tools. In particular, we demonstrate recovery of an image using only a portion
of the received signal's bandwidth and also while dropping a large percentage
of the transmitted pulses. The complementary pulses may be used to capture
other scenes within the same coherent processing interval. In addition, we
propose exploiting the ability to reconstruct the image from narrow bands in
order to dynamically adapt the transmitted waveform energy to vacant spectral
bands, paving the way to cognitive SAR. The proposed recovery algorithms form a
new CS-SAR imaging method that can be applied to high-resolution SAR data
acquired at sub-Nyquist rates in range and azimuth. The performance of our
method is assessed using simulated and real data sets. Finally, our approach is
implemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling radar prototype.

transitive tournament on $N$ vertices have a 1-color-\emph{avoiding} path of
vertex-length at least $N^{2/3}$? This question generalizes the
Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem on monotone subsequences.
  First, we define three canonical transformations on these tournaments called
Color, Record, and Dual. We use these to establish a reduction to special
tournaments with natural geometric and combinatorial properties. In many cases
(including all known tight examples), these tournaments have recursive Gallai
decompositions. Not all relevant tournaments have Gallai decompositions, but
those that do satisfy the desired $N^{2/3}$ bound by recent work of Wagner,
roughly analogous to earlier work of Fox, Grinshpun, and Pach on a similar
\emph{undirected} problem.
  Second, we consider the related geometric problem of bounding
\emph{slice-increasing} sets $S\subseteq [n]^3$, which---under an additional
ordering hypothesis on $S$---was shown by Loh to be equivalent to the original
question. In particular, we establish a rigorous connection from a problem of
Szab\'o and Tardos, raise a stronger $L^2$-question on slice-counts, and
mention a surprising overlap with the joints problem.

  Better","Accepted to the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), 2016",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we are concerned with the resilience of locally routed network
flows with finite link capacities. In this setting, an external inflow is
injected to the so-called origin nodes. The total inflow arriving at each node
is routed locally such that none of the outgoing links are overloaded unless
the node receives an inflow greater than its total outgoing capacity. A link
irreversibly fails if it is overloaded or if there is no operational link in
its immediate downstream to carry its flow. For such systems, resilience is
defined as the minimum amount of reduction in the link capacities that would
result in the failure of all the outgoing links of an origin node. We show that
such networks do not necessarily become more resilient as additional capacity
is built in the network. Moreover, when the external inflow does not exceed the
network capacity, selective reductions of capacity at certain links can
actually help averting the cascading failures, without requiring any change in
the local routing policies. This is an attractive feature as it is often easier
in practice to reduce the available capacity of some critical links than to add
physical capacity or to alter routing policies, e.g., when such policies are
determined by social behavior, as in the case of road traffic networks. The
results can thus be used for real-time monitoring of distance-to-failure in
such networks and devising a feasible course of actions to avert systemic
failures.

range of disc alpha-parameters, thicknesses, magnetic Prandtl numbers, and
inner truncation radii. We find that a large fraction of the magnetic flux in
the pulsar's closed zone is opened by the intrusion of the disc, leading to an
enhancement of the power extracted by the pulsar wind and the spin-down torque
applied to the pulsar. In our simulations, most of the spin-down contribution
to the stellar torque acts on open field lines. The efficiency of field-line
opening is high in the simulations' long-term quasi-steady states, which
implies that a millisecond pulsar's electromagnetic wind could be strong enough
to power the observed neutron-star radio jets, and may significantly affect the

and groups provides a powerful probe of the distribution of hot gas in these
systems via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. A stacking analysis allows one
to detect the average SZ signal around low mass halos, and to extend
measurements out to large scales, which are too faint to detect individually in
the SZ or in X-ray emission. In addition, cross correlations between SZ maps
and other tracers of large-scale structure (with known redshifts) can be used
to extract the redshift-dependence of the SZ background. Motivated by these
exciting prospects, we measure the two-point cross-correlation function between
a catalog of $\sim 380,000$ galaxy groups (with redshifts spanning
$z=0.01-0.2$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Compton-y parameter
maps constructed by the Planck collaboration. We find statistically significant
correlations between the group catalog and Compton-y maps in each of six
separate mass bins, with estimated halo masses in the range $10^{11.5-15.5}
M_\odot/h$. We compare these measurements with halo models of the SZ signal,
which describe the stacked measurement in terms of one-halo and two-halo terms.
The one-halo term quantifies the average pressure profile around the groups in
a mass bin, while the two-halo term describes the contribution of correlated
neighboring halos. For the more massive groups we find clear evidence for the
one- and two-halo regimes, while groups with mass below $10^{13} M_\odot/h$ are
dominated by the two-halo term given the resolution of Planck data. We use the
signal in the two-halo regime to determine the bias-weighted electron pressure

the IATF protocol, the source sends its information to destination via the

that the relay has more chances to accumulate the harvested energy. By modeling
the charging/discharging behaviors of the relay battery as a finite-state

the power consumption data from a real data center, we show that the proposed
LTW can improve the classification accuracy of DTW from about 84% to 90%. Our
experimental results prove that the proposed LTW is competitive on our data set
compared with existed DTW variants and its non-commutative feature is indeed
beneficial. We also test a linear version of LTW and it can significantly
outperform existed linear runtime lower bound methods like LB_Keogh.
Furthermore, with the hybrid algorithm, for the power series classification
task we achieve an accuracy up to about 93%. Our research can inspire more
studies on time series distance measurement and the hybrid of the deep learning
models with other traditional models.

plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH) are studied by density-functional
calculations within the framework of LDA/GGA and LDA/GGA+U.From the total
energy calculation, the lowest-energy crystal structure of PuOH is predicted to
have space group F-43m (No. 216). Within the LDA+U framework, the calculated
lattice parameter of F-43m-PuOH is in good agreement with the experimental
value and the corresponding ground state is predicted to be an
antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulator. Furthermore, we investigate the
bonding character of PuOH by analyzing the electron structure and find that
there are a stronger Pu-O bond and a weaker Pu-H bond.The mechanical properties
including the elastic constants, elastic moduli and Debye's temperature, and
the optical properties including the reflectivity and absorption coefficient
are also calculated. We then compute the phonon spectrum which verified the
dynamical stability of F-43m-PuOH. Some thermodynamic quantities such as the
specific heat are evaluated. Finally we calculate the formation energy of PuOH,
and the reaction energies for the oxidation of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu, which
are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.

find three such objects. Our VLBI AGN identifications are classified as
Seyferts or LINERs in narrow line optical diagnostic plots; mid-infrared
colours of our targets and the comparison of H$\alpha$ star formation rates
with integrated radio luminosity are also consistent with the VLBI
identifications. We reconstruct star formation histories in our galaxies using
optical and UV photometry, and find that these radio AGN are not triggered
promptly in the merger process, consistent with previous findings for non-VLBI
samples of radio AGN. This delay can significantly limit the efficiency of
feedback by radio AGN triggered in galaxy mergers. We find that radio AGN hosts
have lower star formation rates than non-AGN radio-selected galaxies at the
same starburst age. Conventional and VLBI radio imaging shows these AGN to be
compact on arcsecond scales. Our modeling suggests that the actual sizes of
AGN-inflated radio lobes may be much larger than this, but these are too faint
to be detected in existing observations. Deep radio imaging is required to map
out the true extent of the AGN, and to determine whether the low star formation
rates in radio AGN hosts are a result of the special conditions required for
radio jet triggering, or the effect of AGN feedback.

inflationary models, the power spectrum of PGWs is modified in two aspects: One
is the mixture of the perturbation modes caused by he presence of the
pre-inflationary period, and the other is the thermal initial state formed at
the Planck era of the early Universe. By investigating the observational
imprints of these modifications on the B-mode polarization of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation, we obtain the constraints on the conformal
temperature of the thermal gravitational-wave background $T<5.01\times
10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<0.084$ ($95\%$ confident
level), which follows the bounds on total number of e-folds $N>63.5$ for the

small, and it seems impossible to determine its value from the potential

$\dot{P}_{s}=(-2.6288 \pm 0.0095) \times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. Evolution of the
epoch of the mean longitude $l=\pi /2$ (i.e. $T_{\pi / 2}$) gives an orbital
period derivative value consistent with that obtained from the quadratic
ephemeris evaluated by the X-ray eclipse but the detected $T_{\pi / 2}$ values
are significantly and systematically earlier than the corresponding expected
X-ray eclipse times by $90 \pm 11$ s. This deviation is probably caused by
asymmetric X-ray emissions. We also attempted to constrain the mass and radius
of the neutron star using the spin period change rate and concluded that the
intrinsic luminosity of X 1822-371 is likely more than $10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.

of the scalars acquires a vacuum expectation value. The $L_\mu - L_\tau$ gauge
symmetry is known to be anomaly free and can explain the beyond SM measurement
of the anomalous muon $({\rm g-2})$ through additional contribution arising
from the extra $Z_{\mu\tau}$ mediated diagram. Small neutrino masses are
explained naturally through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, while the mixing
angles are predicted to be in their observed ranges due to the broken
$L_\mu-L_\tau$ symmetry. The second complex scalar is shown to be stable and
becomes the dark matter candidate in our model. We show that while the
$Z_{\mu\tau}$ portal is ineffective for the parameters needed to explain the
anomalous muon $({\rm g-2})$ data, the correct dark matter relic abundance can
easily be obtained from annihilation through the Higgs portal. Annihilation of
the scalar dark matter in our model can also explain the Galactic Centre gamma

visual classification tasks including video-based face recognition. The success
mainly derives from learning a discriminant Riemannian metric which encodes the
non-linear geometry of the underlying Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we
propose a novel metric learning framework to learn a distance metric across a
Euclidean space and a Riemannian manifold to fuse the average appearance and
pattern variation of faces within one video. The proposed metric learning
framework can handle three typical tasks of video-based face recognition:
Video-to-Still, Still-to-Video and Video-to-Video settings. To accomplish this
new framework, by exploiting typical Riemannian geometries for kernel
embedding, we map the source Euclidean space and Riemannian manifold into a
common Euclidean subspace, each through a corresponding high-dimensional
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). With this mapping, the problem of
learning a cross-view metric between the two source heterogeneous spaces can be
expressed as learning a single-view Euclidean distance metric in the target
common Euclidean space. By learning information on heterogeneous data with the
shared label, the discriminant metric in the common space improves face
recognition from videos. Extensive experiments on four challenging video face
databases demonstrate that the proposed framework has a clear advantage over
the state-of-the-art methods in the three classical video-based face
recognition tasks.

region, as was noted by Basko \& Sunyaev (1976). The average accretion rate is
very high; ${\dot M}\sim 10^{2-3} L_{\rm E}/c^2$ (with $L_{\rm E}$ being the
Eddington luminosity), and so radiation energy dominates over gas internal
energy entirely within the column. Despite the high accretion rate, the
radiation flux in the laboratory frame is kept barely below $L_{\rm E}/(4\pi
r^2)$ at a distance $r$ in the settling region so that matter can slowly
accrete. This adjustment is made possible, since large amount of photons
produced via dissipation of kinetic energy of matter can escape through the
side boundaries. The total luminosity can greatly exceed $L_{\rm E}$ by several
orders of magnitude, whereas the apparent luminosity observed from the top of
the column is much less. Due to such highly anisotropic radiation fields,
observed flux should exhibit periodic variations with the rotation period,
provided that the rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned.

quantum field theory on curved space-times this history can be pushed
\emph{back in time} to the epoch when space-time curvature was some $10^{62}$
times that at the horizon of a solar mass black hole! However, to extend the
history further back to the Planck regime requires input from quantum gravity.
An important aspect of this input is the choice of the background quantum
geometry and of the Heisenberg state of cosmological perturbations thereon,
motivated by Planck scale physics. This paper introduces first steps in that
direction. Specifically we propose two principles that link quantum geometry
and Heisenberg uncertainties in the Planck epoch with late time physics and
explore in detail the observational consequences of the initial conditions they
select. We find that the predicted temperature-temperature (T-T) correlations
for scalar modes are indistinguishable from standard inflation at small angular
scales even though the initial conditions are now set in the deep Planck
regime. However, \emph{there is a specific power suppression at large angular
scales}. As a result, the predicted spectrum provides a better fit to the
PLANCK mission data than standard inflation, where the initial conditions are
set in the general relativity regime. Thus, our proposal brings out a deep
interplay between the ultraviolet and the infrared. Finally, the proposal also
leads to specific predictions for power suppression at large angular scales

PLANCK team is expected to release this data in the coming year.

imaging from SDO/AIA at multiple wavelengths and identify a series of
quasi-periodic rapidly-propagating enhancements, which we interpret as a fast
wave train, and link these to the detected radio features. The speeds and
positions of the periodic rapidly propagating fast waves and the coronal mass
ejection (CME) were recorded using running-difference images and time-distance
analysis. From the frequency of the radio sparks the local electron density at
the emission location was estimated for each. Using an empirical model for the
scaling of density in the corona, the calculated electron density was used to
obtain the height above the surface at which the emission occurs, and the
propagation velocity of the emission location. The period of the radio sparks,
$\delta t_\mathrm{r}$=1.78$\pm$0.04 min, matches the period of the fast wave
train observed at 171 $\AA$, $\delta t_\mathrm{EUV}$=1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 min. The
inferred speed of the emission location of the radio sparks, 630 km s$^{-1}$,
is comparable to the measured speed of the CME leading edge, 500 km s$^{-1}$,
and the speeds derived from the drifting of the type II lanes. The calculated
height of the radio emission (obtained from the density) matches the observed
location of the CME leading edge. From the above evidence we propose that the
radio sparks are caused by the quasi-periodic fast waves, and the emission is
generated as they catch up and interact with the leading edge of the CME.

the conditions under which the resulting vortex develops an eye at its core;
that is, a region where the poloidal flow reverses and the angular momentum is
low. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to steady, axisymmetric flows in a
Boussinesq fluid. Our numerical experiments show that, in such systems, an eye
forms as a passive response to the development of a so-called eyewall, a
conical annulus of intense, negative azimuthal vorticity that can form near the
axis and separates the eye from the primary vortex. We also observe that the
vorticity in the eyewall comes from the lower boundary layer, and relies on the
fact the poloidal flow strips negative vorticity out of the boundary layer and
carries it up into the fluid above as it turns upward near the axis. This
process is effective only if the Reynolds number is sufficiently high for the
advection of vorticity to dominate over diffusion. Finally we observe that, in
the vicinity of the eye and the eyewall, the buoyancy and Coriolis forces are
negligible, and so although these forces are crucial to driving and shaping the

nonlinear resonant interaction between gravity waves on the surface of deep

resonance as we show that exchanges of energy between the waves can be enhanced
when the interaction is three-wave rather than four and the linear frequency
mismatch, or detuning, is non-zero i.e. $\omega_1\pm\omega_2\pm\omega_3 \neq0.$
This is possible because the resonance condition is now a match between the
so-called 'precession frequency' of a given $\textit{triad interaction}$ and an
existent nonlinear frequency in the system. In the limit of weak nonlinearity
this precession frequency is simply due to the linear 'drift' of the triad
phase; therefore, it tends toward the detuning. This means precession resonance
of this type can occur at finite amplitudes, with nonlinear corrections
contributing to the resonance. We report energy transfer efficiencies of up to
40%, depending on the model options. To the authors' knowledge this represents
the first new type of nonlinear resonance in surface gravity waves since the

open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online

infinite-server systems. In such models, the customers' arrival rates and
service rates are modulated by a Markovian background process, additionally,
there are infinitely many servers (and consequently the resulting model is
often used as a proxy for the corresponding many-server model). The
Markov-modulated infinite-server model hardly allows any explicit analysis,
apart from results in terms of systems of (ordinary or partial) differential
equations for the underlying probability generating functions, and recursions
to obtain all moments. As a consequence, recent research efforts have pursued
an asymptotic analysis in various limiting regimes, notably the central-limit
regime (describing fluctuations around the average behavior) and the
large-deviations regime (focusing on rare events). Many of these results use
the property that the number of customers in the system obeys a Poisson
distribution with a random parameter.
  The objective of this paper is to develop techniques to accurately
approximate tail probabilities in the large-deviations regime. We consider the
scaling in which the arrival rates are inflated by a factor $N$, and we are
interested in the probability that the number of customers exceeds a given
level $Na$. Where earlier contributions focused on so-called $logarithmic$
$asymptotics$ of this exceedance probability (which are inherently imprecise),
the present paper improves upon those results in that $exact$ $asymptotics$ are
established. These are found in two steps: first the distribution of the random
parameter of the Poisson distribution is characterized, and then this knowledge
is used to identify the exact asymptotics. The paper is concluded by a set of
numerical experiments, in which the accuracy of the asymptotic results is

the group, and the existence of a subgroup of finite index with some particular
property can therefore imply useful structural information for the overgroup. A
developed theory of cosets in inverse semigroups exists, originally due to
Schein: it is defined only for closed inverse subsemigroups, and the structural
correspondences between an inverse semigroup and a closed inverse subsemigroup
of finite index are weaker than in the group case. Nevertheless, many aspects
of this theory are of interest, and some of them are addressed in this paper.
We study the basic theory of cosets in inverse semigroups, including an index
formula for chains of subgroups and an analogue of M. Hall's Theorem on
counting subgroups of finite index in finitely generated groups. We then look
in detail at the connection between the following properties of a closed
inverse submonoid of an inverse monoid: having finite index; being a
recognisable subset; being a rational subset; being finitely generated (as a
closed inverse submonoid). A remarkable result of Margolis and Meakin shows
that these properties are equivalent for closed inverse submonoids of free

and Fermi pockets in the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors? This
puzzle is calling for an explanation. Based on the t-J model in the
fermion-spin representation, the coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi
pockets in cuprate superconductors is studied by taking into account the
pseudogap effect. It is shown that the pseudogap induces an energy band
splitting, and then the poles of the electron Green's function at zero energy
form two contours in momentum space, however, the electron spectral weight on
these two contours around the antinodal region is gapped out by the pseudogap,
leaving behind the low-energy electron spectral weight only located at the
disconnected segments around the nodal region. In particular, the tips of these
disconnected segments converge on the hot spots to form the closed Fermi
pockets, generating a coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets.
Moreover, the single-particle coherent weight is directly related to the
pseudogap, and grows linearly with doping. The calculated result of the overall
dispersion of the electron excitations is in qualitative agreement with the
experimental data. The theory also predicts that the pseudogap-induced
peak-dip-hump structure in the electron spectrum is absent from the hot-spot
directions.

proof of strong spin-phonon coupling in FeRh. The FM VDOS exhibits a particular
sensitivity to the slight tetragonal distortions present in epitaxial films,
which is not encountered in the AF phase. This results in a notable change in
lattice entropy, which is important for the comparison between thin film and

strategic variant of the generalized assignment problem (GAP) in a both
payment-free and prior-free environment. In GAP, a set of items has to be
optimally assigned to a set of bins without exceeding the capacity of any
singular bin. In the strategic variant of the problem we study, bins are held
by strategic agents, and each agent may hide its compatibility with some items
in order to obtain items of higher values. The compatibility between an agent
and an item encodes the willingness of the agent to receive the item. Our goal
is to maximize total value (sum of agents' values, or social welfare) while
certifying no agent can benefit from hiding its compatibility with items. The
model has applications in auctions with budgeted bidders. For two variants of
the problem, namely \emph{multiple knapsack problem} in which each item has the
same size and value over bins, and \emph{density-invariant GAP} in which each
item has the same value density over the bins, we propose truthful
$4$-approximation algorithms. For the general problem, we propose an
$O(\ln{(U/L)})$-approximation mechanism where $U$ and $L$ are the upper and
lower bounds for value densities of the compatible item-bin pairs.

astrophysical event under extremely neutron-rich conditions, leading to
(n,$\gamma$)-($\gamma$,n) equilibrium along isotopic chains which peaks around
neutron separation energies of a few MeV. Nuclei with larger $Z$ are usually
produced by $\beta^-$-decay, but under certain conditions also $\alpha$-induced
reactions may become relevant for the production of nuclei with $Z+2$.
  Purpose: The uncertainties of the reaction rates of these $\alpha$-induced
reactions are discussed within the statistical model. As an example,
$\alpha$-induced ($\alpha$,n) and $(\alpha$,$x$n) reaction cross sections for
the neutron-rich $^{86}$Se nucleus are studied in detail.
  Method: In a first step, the relevance of ($\alpha$,n) and $(\alpha$,$x$n)
reactions is analyzed. Next the uncertainties are determined from a variation
of the $\alpha$-nucleus potential which is the all-dominant parameter for the
astrophysical $Z \rightarrow Z+2$ reaction rate.
  Results: It is found that the $r$-process flow towards nuclei with larger $Z$
is essentially influenced only by the $\alpha$-nucleus potential whereas the
other ingredients of the statistical model play a very minor role. This finding
is based on the fact that the flow towards larger $Z$ depends on the sum over
all ($\alpha$,$x$n) cross sections which is practically identical to the total
$\alpha$-induced reaction cross section.
  Conclusions: $\alpha$-nucleus potentials play an important role under certain
$r$-process conditions because the flow towards larger $Z$ depends sensitively
on the total $\alpha$-induced reaction cross section. The uncertainty of the
reaction rate is about a factor of two to three at higher temperatures and
exceeds one order of magnitude at very low temperatures.

problems about the geometry of pairwise intersections. Reay asked for the
minimum number of points in Euclidean d-space that guarantees any such point
set admits a partition into r parts, any k of whose convex hulls intersect.
Here we give new and improved lower bounds for this number, which Reay
conjectured to be independent of k. We prove a colored version of Reay's
conjecture for k sufficiently large, but nevertheless k independent of
dimension d. Requiring convex hulls to intersect pairwise severely restricts
combinatorics. This is a higher-dimensional analog of Conway's thrackle
conjecture or its linear special case. We thus study convex-geometric and
higher-dimensional analogs of the thrackle conjecture alongside Reay's problem
and conjecture (and prove in two special cases) that the number of convex sets
in the plane is bounded by the total number of vertices they involve whenever
there exists a transversal set for their pairwise intersections. We thus
isolate a geometric property that leads to bounds as in the thrackle

hydrodynamic simulations of realistically fast AGN winds striking Bonnor-Ebert

velocities ranging from 300--3,000 km s$^{-1}$ and wind densities ranging from
0.5--10 $m_\mathrm{p}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We include heating and cooling of
low- and high-temperature gas, self-gravity, and spatially correlated
perturbations in the shock, with a maximum resolution of 0.01 pc. We find that
the ram pressure is the most important factor that determines the fate of the
cloud. High ram pressure winds increase fragmentation and decrease the star
formation rate, but also cause star formation to occur on a much shorter time
scale and with increased velocities of the newly formed stars. We find a
threshold ram pressure of $\sim 2\times10^{-8}$ dyne cm$^{-2}$ above which
stars are not formed because the resulting clumps have internal velocities
large enough to prevent collapse. Our results indicate that simultaneous
positive and negative feedback will be possible in a single galaxy as AGN wind

type $1,1$-operators are defined and continuous on the full space of temperate
distributions, if they fulfil H\""ormander's twisted diagonal condition, or more
generally if they belong to the self-adjoint subclass; and that they are always
defined on the temperate smooth functions. As a main tool the paradifferential
decomposition is derived for type $1,1$-operators, and to confirm a natural
hypothesis the symmetric term is shown to cause the domain restrictions;
whereas the other terms are shown to define nice type $1,1$-operators
fulfilling the twisted diagonal condition. The decomposition is analysed in the
type $1,1$-context by combining the Spectral Support Rule and the factorisation
inequality, which gives pointwise estimates of pseudo-differential operators in

applied to both linear and non-linear models, first for the standard case of
networks with positive edges, before being generalized to the case of signed

appearance of zebra-pattern (ZP) structures in time spectra of solar type IV

Instant values of the plasma density and magnetic field at the DPR layers

  Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed identified prospective
metastatic breast cancer studies. Treatments effects on PFS were determined
using hazard ratio (HR$_{PFS}$), increase in median PFS ($\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$)
and % increase in median PFS (%$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$). Diagnostic accuracy of PFS
measures (HR$_{PFS}$, $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$) in

  Results: Seventy-three cases (i.e., treatment to control comparisons) from 64
individual publications were identified for the analyses. Of these, 16 cases
reported significant treatment effect on HR$_{OS}$ at 5% level of significance.
Median number of deaths reported in these cases were 156. Area under the ROC
curve (AUC) for diagnostic measures as HR$_{PFS}$, $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and
%$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ were 0.69, 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. Classification
tree results identified %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and number of deaths as diagnostic

were 7 cases with $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ of 48.27\% or more and number of deaths

  Conclusion: %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ was found as better diagnostic measure for

crust by rapid fallback accretion and could diffuse to the surface later in
life. According to this field burial scenario young pulsars may have growing
magnetic fields, a process known to result with less-than-three braking
indices; larger braking indices implying longer field-growth time-scales. A
nascent neutron star with a larger kick velocity would accrete less amount of
matter leading to a shallower burial of its field and a more rapid field
growth. Such an inverse relation between the field growth time-scale inferred
from the braking indices and space velocity of pulsars was claimed in the past
as a prediction of the field-burial scenario. With a braking index of $n\sim 2$
and large space velocity PSR~B0540--69 was then an outlier in the claimed
relation. The object recently made a transition to a rapid spin-down state
accompanied by a low braking index. This new braking index implies a much
shorter time-scale for the field growth which is consistent with the high space
velocity of the object, in better agreement with the claimed relation. This
observation lends support to the field burial scenario and implies that the
growth of the magnetic field does not proceed at a constant pace but is slowed
or completely halted at times. The slow spin-down state associated with the
high braking index before 2011 which lasted for at least about 30 years was
then such an episode of slow field growth.

laminar jet are investigated numerically with a Lagrangian solver implemented
within the framework of the OpenFOAM$^{\circledR}$ CFD package. Effects of
taper angle of the nozzle channel and jet-to-plate distance are evaluated. The
results show that tapered nozzle tends to deposit more particles toward the
circular spot edge than straight nozzle. At jet Reynolds number $Re = 1132$, a
tapered nozzle deposits particles to form a pattern with a high density ring
toward the deposition spot edge, especially for particle Stokes number $St >
St_{50}$, which is absent with a straight nozzle. Increasing the jet-to-plate
distance tends to reduce the value of particle density peak near deposition
spot edge. Reducing $Re$ to $283$ (e.g., for $300$ ccm flow through a $1.5$ mm
diameter jet nozzle) yields particle deposition patterns without the high
density ring at the deposition spot edge when the same tapered nozzle is used.
The particle deposition patterns with the straight nozzle at $Re = 283$ exhibit
further reduced particle density around the spot edge such that the particle
density profile appears more or less like a Gaussian function. In general, the
effect of reducing $Re$ on particle deposition pattern seems to be similar to
increasing the jet-to-plate distance. The computed particle deposition
efficiency $\eta$ shows the fact that very fine particles with extremely small
values of $St$ near the jet axis always impact the center of plate, indicating
that the value of $\eta$ does not approach zero with a substantial reduction of
$St$. Such a ""small particle contamination"" typically amounts to $\sim 10\%$ of
small particles (with $\sqrt{St} < 0.1$) at $Re \sim 1000$ and $\sim 5\%$ at

From the knowledge of
light, we know that wave is always spread out, and hence the electron wave
should also spread out. That means the electron wave beam should like the light
wave beam become diverged from the source. When the electron is received by an
atom we thought the wave collapse. The place to collapse is depends on the
probability calculated from the square of absolute value of the wave function.
The recent new discovery tell us that the light is not just wave, it is a
combination of waves, retarded potential and advanced potential. These two
potentials together produce the mutual energy current or referred as M-current.
Another light energy current is P-current related to Poynting vector. We found
P-current doesn't carry any energy for light. The contribution of P-current to
energy transfer can be omitted. The light energy is transferred only by
M-current. The beam of M-current doesn't like the beam of P-current which is
diverged from the source, instead, the M-current beam first diverges from a
source and then converged to a sink. Since the M-current at the place to be
received is localized at one electron, the concept of wave function collapse is
needless. The probability results of light is because that we have use
P-current to roughly calculate the M-current. We thought if Schr\""odinger knew
today's light theory, he would for sure also build his wave theory for quantum
mechanics similar to the new light theory with M-current. Hence we claim that
the M-current theory is not only suitable to the light but also can be applied
to the quantum physics. This means all particles are M-current. The M-current
is composed of not only the retarded wave, but also the advanced wave.
M-current is an inner product of a retarded and an advanced waves.

wavelet coefficients exhibit a rooted tree structure can be recovered using
specially-adapted compressed sensing algorithms from just n=O(k) measurements,
where k is the sparsity of the signal. Motivated by these results, we introduce
a simplified proportional-dimensional asymptotic framework which enables the
quantitative evaluation of recovery guarantees for tree-based compressed
sensing. In the context of Gaussian matrices, we apply this framework to
existing worst-case analysis of the Iterative Tree Projection (ITP) algorithm
which makes use of the tree-based Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). Within
the same framework, we then obtain quantitative results based on a new method
of analysis, recently introduced in [Cartis and Thompson, 2015], which
considers the fixed points of the algorithm. By exploiting the realistic
average-case assumption that the measurements are statistically independent of
the signal, we obtain significant quantitative improvements when compared to
the tree-based RIP analysis. Our results have a refreshingly simple
interpretation, explicitly determining a bound on the number of measurements
that are required as a multiple of the sparsity. For example we prove that
exact recovery of binary tree-based signals from noiseless Gaussian
measurements is asymptotically guaranteed for ITP with constant stepsize
provided n>50k. All our results extend to the more realistic case in which
measurements are corrupted by noise.
