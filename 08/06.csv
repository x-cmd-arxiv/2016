+iV(x)$, with a purely complex potential $iV(x)$. A rigorous definition of this
non-selfadjoint operator is provided for bounded and unbounded domains with
common boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin and transmission). We
propose a general perturbative approach to construct its quasimodes in the
semi-classical limit. An alternative WKB construction is also discussed. These
approaches are local and thus valid for both bounded and unbounded domains,
allowing one to compute the approximate eigenvalues to any order in the small
$h$ limit. The general results are further illustrated on the particular case
of the Bloch-Torrey operator, $-h^2\Delta + ix_1$, for which a four-term
asymptotics is explicitly computed. Its high accuracy is confirmed by a
numerical computation of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this operator
for a disk and circular annuli. The localization of eigenfunctions near the
specific boundary points is revealed. Some applications in the field of
diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance are discussed.

an exponential decline time scale of $(96 \pm 3)$ days. We use the absorption

physics and the dynamics of the expanding atmosphere during the explosion of
the nova. The information extracted from this first stage is then used as input
for computing full photoionization models of the ejecta in V4743 Sgr. The SSS
spectrum is modeled with a simple black-body and multiplicative Gaussian lines,
which provides us of a general kinematical picture of the system, before it
decays to its faint phase (Ness et al. 2003). In the grating spectra taken
between days 180.4 and 370, we can resolve the line profiles of absorption
lines arising from H-like and He-like C, N, and O, including transitions
involving higher principal quantum numbers. Except for a few interstellar
lines, all lines are significantly blue-shifted, yielding velocities between
1000 and 6000 km/s which implies an ongoing mass loss. It is shown that
significant expansion and mass loss occur during this phase of the explosion,
at a rate $\dot{M} \approx (3-5) \times 10^{-4} ~ (\frac{L}{L_{38}}) ~

which is equivalent to having a low-degree algebraic root. It is known in
certain cases that random polynomials with integer coefficients are very likely
to be irreducible, and our project can be viewed as part of the general program
of testing whether this is a universal behavior exhibited by many random
polynomial models.
  Our main result shows that pointwise delocalization of the roots of a random
polynomial can be used to imply that the polynomial is unlikely to have a
low-degree factor over the integers. We apply our main result to a number of
models of random polynomials, including characteristic polynomials of random
matrices, where strong delocalization results are known. Studying a variety of
random matrix models---including iid matrices, symmetric matrices, elliptical
matrices, and adjacency matrices of random graphs and digraphs---we show that,
for a random square matrix with integer entries, the characteristic polynomial
is unlikely to have a low-degree factor over the integers, which is equivalent
to the matrix having an eigenvalue that is algebraic with low degree. Having a
low-degree algebraic eigenvalue generalizes the questions of whether the matrix
has a rational eigenvalue and whether the matrix is singular (i.e., has an
eigenvalue equal to zero).

accuracy when predicting the time-bin location than when predicting the next

uncover that the exploration of new locations is an important factor in human

Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The
GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform
model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal
visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and
general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The
simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully
general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere,in showing that the signal
was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The
black holes were each of approximately 35 Msun, still orbited each other as
close as ~350 km apart, and subsequently merged to form a single black hole.
Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far
these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in
gravitational waves.

antiferromagnets have opened a new avenue in the research of non-volatile
spintronic devices. Antiparallel spin sublattices in antiferromagnets,
producing zero dipolar fields, lead to the insensitivity to magnetic field
perturbations, multi-level stability, ultra-fast spin dynamics and other
favorable characteristics which may find utility in fields ranging from
magnetic memories to optical signal processing. However, the absence of a net
magnetic moment and the ultra-short magnetization dynamics timescales make
antiferromagnets notoriously difficult to study by common magnetometers or
magnetic resonance techniques. In this paper we demonstrate the experimental
determination of the Neel vector in a thin film of antiferromagnetic CuMnAs
which is the prominent material used in the first realization of
antiferromagnetic memory chips. We employ a femtosecond pump-probe
magneto-optical experiment based on magnetic linear dichroism. This table-top
optical method is considerably more accessible than the traditionally employed
large scale facility techniques like neutron diffraction and X-ray magnetic
dichroism measurements. This optical technique allows an unambiguous direct
determination of the Neel vector orientation in thin antiferromagnetic films
utilized in devices directly from measured data without fitting to a
theoretical model.

modified $4f$-imaging system, where the spatial frequency of a two-line source
was doubled or tripled on the confocal Fourier plane of the $4f$-imaging system
through a light pulse storage and retrieval process based on the
electromagnetically induced transparency effect in a Pr$^{3+}$:$\rm Y_2SiO_5$
crystal, and an originally unresolvable image of the two line sources in the
conventional $4f$-imaging system became resolvable with the spatial frequency
doubling or tripling. Our results offer an original way towards improving
optical imaging resolution without beating the diffraction limit of light,

suddenly perceived by an external listener as perfectly tuned -as if it was

This collective phenomenon is an example of a wisdom of crowds effect that can
be routinely observed in music concerts or other social events, when a group of
people spontaneously sings at unison. In this paper we rely on the
psychoacoustic properties of pitch and provide a simple mechanistic explanation
for the onset of this emergent behavior.

signature of an extra spatial dimension. We describe here an approach for
searching for PBH explosions using a low-frequency radio antenna array, and as
a practical example, the results of a such a search using the
Eight-meter-wavelength Transient Array (ETA). No compelling astrophysical
signal was detected in $\approx 4$ hours of data implying an observational
upper limit on the rate of exploding PBHs is $4.2 \times 10^{-7}
\,\rm{pc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ for an exploding PBH with a fireball Lorentz
factor of $10^{4.5}$ for the standard scenario of Page and Hawking. This rate
limit is the strongest constraint yet set for PBH explosions with this fireball
Lorentz factor. Observations ($\sim300$ hours) using the Arecibo Observatory
were used to set a stronger constraint on the rate of PBH explosions for a
fireball Lorentz factor of $10^{4.6}$ but the limit set by those observations
for the fireball Lorentz factor considered here are less stringent by more than
an order of magnitude. The limits considered here are applicable to exploding
PBHs in the halo of the Galaxy. These observations also imply an upper limit of
$2.0 \times 10^{-4} \,\rm{pc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ on the rate of PBH explosions
in the context of certain extra dimension models as described by Kavic et al.
This rate limit is for a fireball Lorentz factor of $10^{4.3}$ which
corresponds to an extra dimension compactification scale of $3.0 \times
10^{-18}$m.

the same for all examples; however, examples may be context-dependent. This
means that some examples should be explained in the context of some
information, whereas others should be explained in different contexts. In this
paper, we capture this notion and present a context-dependent extension of the
Learning from Ordered Answer Sets framework. In this extension, contexts can be
used to further structure the background knowledge. We then propose a new
iterative algorithm, ILASP2i, which exploits this feature to scale up the
existing ILASP2 system to learning tasks with large numbers of examples. We
demonstrate the gain in scalability by applying both algorithms to various

at 100~MHz. Here, giant pulses are taken as having $\geq$ 10 times the flux
density of an average pulse; their cumulative distribution of pulse strength
follows a power law, with a index of $-$4.1 at 42~MHz and $-$5.1 at 74~MHz,
which is much less steep than would be expected if we were observing the tail
of a Gaussian distribution of normal pulses. We detected no other transient
pulses in a wide dispersion measure range from 1 to 5000~pc~cm$^{-3}$. There
were 128 giant pulses detected within in the same periods from both 42 and
74~MHz, which means more than half of them are not generated in a wide band. We
use CLEAN-based algorithm to analyze the temporal broadening and conclude that
the scattering effect from the interstellar medium can not be observed. We
calculated the altitude $r$ of the emission region using the dipolar magnetic

vanishes at the critical pressure $p_c\approx1~$GPa. Superconductivity is
observed in both the ferromagnetic state at low pressure, and in the
paramagnetic state above $p_c$ up to about 4$~$GPa. Non-Fermi liquid behavior
appears in a large pressure range. The resistivity varies linearly with
temperature around $p_c$ and evolves continuously with pressure to a $T^2$
Fermi-liquid behavior for $p \gtrapprox 5$~GPa. The residual resistivity as a
function of pressure shows a maximum far above $p_c$ at $p^\star=7.2~$GPa and
the amplitude of the inelastic scattering term of the resistivity decreases by
more than one order in magnitude at $p^\star$, which appears to mark the
entrance into a weakly correlated regime. The pressure dependence of the upper
critical field for magnetic field applied along the $b$ and $c$ axis
illustrates the drastic difference in the field dependence of the ferromagnetic
superconducting pairing. While for $H\parallel b$ axis $H_{c2}(T)$ is driven by
the suppression of the ferromagnetic order, it is dominated by the strong
initial suppression of the ferromagnetic fluctuations for a field applied in
the easy magnetization axis $c$.

an average pulse at 74~MHz. The cumulative distribution of pulse strength
follows a power law, with an index of $-$4.2 at 38~MHz and $-$4.9 at 74~MHz.
This distribution has a much more gradual slope than would be expected if
observing the tail of a Gaussian distribution of normal pulses. The dispersion
measure value which resulted in the largest signal-to-noise for dedispersed
pulses was DM $=10.9$~pc~cm$^{-3}$. No other transient pulses were detected in
the data in the wide dispersion measure range from 1 to 5000~pc~cm$^{-3}$.
There were 12 giant pulses detected within the same period from both 38 and
74~MHz, meaning that the majority of them are not generated in a wide band.

magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of each source. In order
to further synthesizing time-domain signals, it is necessary to recover the
phase of the corresponding complex-valued STFT. Most authors in this field
choose a Wiener-like filtering approach which boils down to using the phase of
the original mixture. In this paper, a different standpoint is adopted. Many
music events are partially composed of slowly varying sinusoids and the STFT
phase increment over time of those frequency components takes a specific form.
This allows phase recovery by an unwrapping technique once a short-term
frequency estimate has been obtained. Herein, a novel iterative source
separation procedure is proposed which builds upon these results. It consists
in minimizing the mixing error by means of the auxiliary function method. This
procedure is initialized by exploiting the unwrapping technique in order to
generate estimates that benefit from a temporal continuity property.
Experiments conducted on realistic music pieces show that, given accurate
magnitude estimates, this procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art consistent
Wiener filter.

to be a small-band-gap semiconductor (E_g = 0.46 eV in PBE and 0.60 eV in
HSE06), CoZrBi has a band gap of 1.01 eV in PBE (1.34 eV in HSE06). Moreover,
effective masses and deformation potentials are reported. In both materials
ABC, the intrinsic point defects introduced by species A (Ni or Co) are

atom (Ni_i ) as well as the V_Ni Ni_i complex introduce defect states in the
band gap, whereas the Ni vacancy (V_Ni) only reduces the size of the band gap.
Motivated by the reported use of NiZrSn for thermoelectric applications, the
Seebeck coefficient of both materials is calculated. We find that CoZrBi
displays a rather large thermopower of up to 500 micro-V/K when p-doped,
whereas NiZrSn possesses its maximum thermopower in the n-type regime. The
reported difficulties in achieving p-type doping in NiZrSn could be
rationalized by the unintended formation of Ni_i^2+ in conjunction with
extrinsic acceptors, resulting in their compensation. Moreover, it is found
that all types of defects considered, when present in concentrations as large
as 3%, tend to reduce the thermopower compared to ideal bulk crystals at
T=600K. For NiZrSn, the calculated thermodynamic data suggest that additional
Ni impurities could be removed by annealing, leading to precipitation of a
metallic Ni_2ZrSn phase.

the existence of a system inherent maximal output power. By implementing a

However, the form in which most of the sulfur is locked onto interstellar dust

properties of H$_2$S gas in L1157-B1 through use of a rotation diagram and to
explore the possible carriers of sulfur on the grains. The isotopologue
detections allow the first calculation of the H$_2$S deuteration fraction in an
outflow from a low mass protostar. The fractional abundance of H$_2$S in the
region is found to be 6.0$\times$10$^{-7}$ and the deuteration fraction is
2$\times$10$^{-2}$. In order to investigate the form of sulfur on the grains, a
chemical model is run with four different networks, each with different
branching ratios for the freeze out of sulfur bearing species into molecules

least half of each sulfur bearing species hydrogenates when freezing. We
therefore conclude that a significant fraction of sulfur in L1157-B1 is likely

explicit analytical formulas for finite hard-sphere packings. We show
analytically how the contacts between spheres in the MRJ packings translate
into distinct functional behaviors of these two-point correlation functions

spectral density distinguishes the MRJ packings from the other disordered

fluctuations on large length scales are anomalously suppressed. Moreover, we
study and compute exclusion probabilities and pore size distributions as well

uncertainty relations, based on the notion of relative entropy between
measurement probabilities. In the case of a finite-dimensional system and for
any approximate joint measurement of two target discrete observables, we define
the entropic divergence as the maximal total loss of information occurring in
the approximation at hand. For fixed target observables, we study the joint
measurements minimizing the entropic divergence, and we prove the general
properties of its minimum value. Such a minimum is our uncertainty lower bound:
the total information lost by replacing the target observables with their
optimal approximations, evaluated at the worst possible state. The bound turns
out to be also an entropic incompatibility degree, that is, a good
information-theoretic measure of incompatibility: indeed, it vanishes if and
only if the target observables are compatible, it is state-independent, and it
enjoys all the invariance properties which are desirable for such a measure. In
this context, we point out the difference between general approximate joint
measurements and sequential approximate joint measurements; to do this, we
introduce a separate index for the tradeoff between the error of the first
measurement and the disturbance of the second one. By exploiting the symmetry
properties of the target observables, exact values, lower bounds and optimal
approximations are evaluated in two different concrete examples: (1) a couple
of spin-1/2 components (not necessarily orthogonal); (2) two Fourier conjugate
mutually unbiased bases in prime power dimension. Finally, the entropic
incompatibility degree straightforwardly generalizes to the case of many
observables, still maintaining all its relevant properties; we explicitly
compute it for three orthogonal spin-1/2 components.

components of human collective intelligence. How are accurate shared beliefs
formed in groups of fallible individuals? Answering this question requires a
multiscale analysis. We must understand both the individual decision mechanisms
people use, and the properties and dynamics of those mechanisms in the
aggregate. As of yet, mathematical tools for such an approach have been
lacking. To address this gap, we introduce a new analytical framework: We
propose that groups arrive at accurate shared beliefs via distributed Bayesian
inference. Distributed inference occurs through information processing at the
individual level, and yields rational belief formation at the group level. We
instantiate this framework in a new model of human social decision-making,
which we validate using a dataset we collected of over 50,000 users of an
online social trading platform where investors mimic each others' trades using
real money in foreign exchange and other asset markets. We find that in this
setting people use a decision mechanism in which popularity is treated as a
prior distribution for which decisions are best to make. This mechanism is
boundedly rational at the individual level, but we prove that in the aggregate
implements a type of approximate ""Thompson sampling""---a well-known and highly
effective single-agent Bayesian machine learning algorithm for sequential
decision-making. The perspective of distributed Bayesian inference therefore
reveals how collective rationality emerges from the boundedly rational decision
mechanisms people use.

chromosphere is to be explored and compared to that in the photosphere. High
spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations were recorded with the
1.5-meter GREGOR telescope using the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS). The
observed spectral domain includes the upper chromospheric He I triplet at
1083.0 nm and the photospheric Si I 1082.7 nm and Ca I 1083.3 nm spectral
lines. The upper chromospheric magnetic field is obtained by inverting the He I
triplet assuming a Milne-Eddington type model atmosphere. A height dependent
inversion was applied to the Si I 1082.7 nm and Ca I 1083.3 nm lines to obtain
the photospheric magnetic field. We find that the inclination of the magnetic
field shows variations in the azimuthal direction both in the photosphere, but
also in the upper chromosphere. The chromospheric variations remarkably well
coincide with the variations in the inclination of the photospheric field and
resemble the well-known spine and inter-spine structure in the photospheric
layers of penumbrae. The typical peak-to-peak variations in the inclination of
the magnetic field in the upper chromosphere is found to be 10-15 degree, i.e.,
roughly half the variation in the photosphere. In contrast, the magnetic field
strength of the observed penumbra does not show variations on small spatial
scales in the upper chromosphere. Thanks to the high spatial resolution
observations possible with the GREGOR telescope at 1.08 microns, we find that
the prominent small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field inclination, which
are a salient part of the property of sunspot penumbral photospheres, also
persist in the chromosphere, although at somewhat reduced amplitudes. Such a
complex magnetic configuration may facilitate penumbral chromospheric dynamic
phenomena, such as penumbral micro-jets or transient bright dots.

of dark matter in the 0.01 eV to eV mass range. Energetic dark matter particles
emitted from the sun can also be probed for masses below an eV. We derive the
reach for absorption of a relic kinetically mixed dark photon or pseudoscalar
in germanium and silicon, and show that existing direct detection results
already probe new parameter space. With only a moderate exposure, low-threshold
semiconductor target experiments can exceed current astrophysical and
terrestrial constraints on sub-keV bosonic dark matter.

the differential rotation in red giants with measured mixed mode rotational
splittings. Specifically, in red giants with radii $\sim 4R_\odot$, the
splittings of p-dominated modes (sound wave dominated) relative to those of
g-dominated modes (internal gravity wave dominated) are sensitive to how much
of the differential rotation resides in the outer convection zone versus the
radiative interior of the red giant. An independently measured surface rotation
rate significantly aids breaking degeneracies in interpreting the measured
splittings. We apply our results to existing observations of red giants,
particularly those of Kepler-56, and find that most of the differential
rotation resides in the radiative region rather than in the convection zone.
This conclusion is consistent with results in the literature from rotational
inversions, but our results are insensitive to some of the uncertainties in the
inversion process and can be readily applied to large samples of red giants
with even a modest number of measured rotational splittings. We argue that
differential rotation in the radiative interior strongly suggests that angular
momentum transport in red giants is dominated by local fluid instabilities
rather than large-scale magnetic stresses.

whose spectra are characterized by low-velocity helium emission lines with
little to no evidence for hydrogen. The prevailing theory has been that these
are the core-collapse explosions of very massive stars embedded in helium-rich
circumstellar material (CSM). We report optical observations of six new SNe
Ibn: PTF11rfh, PTF12ldy, iPTF14aki, iPTF15ul, SN 2015G, and iPTF15akq. This

new data, including a near-infrared spectrum, on the Type Ibn SN 2015U. In
order to characterize the class as a whole, we analyze the photometric and
spectroscopic properties of the full Type Ibn sample. We find that, despite the
expectation that CSM interaction would generate a heterogeneous set of light
curves, as seen in SNe IIn, most Type Ibn light curves are quite similar in
shape, declining at rates around 0.1 mag/day during the first month after
maximum light, with a few significant exceptions. Early spectra of SNe Ibn come
in at least two varieties, one that shows narrow P Cygni lines and another
dominated by broader emission lines, both around maximum light, which may be an
indication of differences in the state of the progenitor system at the time of
explosion. Alternatively, the spectral diversity could arise from viewing-angle
effects or merely from a lack of early spectroscopic coverage. Together, the
relative light curve homogeneity and narrow spectral features suggest that the
CSM consists of a spatially confined shell of helium surrounded by a less dense
extended wind.

which $p_{Tj}$ is weighted by a smooth function of the jet rapidity $y_j$ that
vanishes as $|y_j| \to \infty$. Such observables are useful as they provide a
natural way to impose a tight veto on central jets but a looser one at forward
rapidities. We consider two such rapidity-dependent jet veto observables,
$\mathcal{T}_{Bj}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{Cj}$, and compute the required beam and
dijet soft functions for the jet-vetoed color-singlet production cross section

such constraints. We model the observed velocity distribution of HVSs, produced
by tidal break-up of stellar binaries caused by Sgr A*. Considering a Galactic
Centre (GC) binary population consistent with that inferred in more
observationally accessible regions, a fit to current HVS data with significance
level > 5\% can only be obtained if the escape velocity from the GC to 50 kpc
is $V_G < 850$ km/s, regardless of the enclosed mass distribution. When a NFW
matter density profile for the dark matter halo is assumed, haloes with $V_G <
850$ km/s are in agreement with predictions in the $\Lambda$CDM model and that
a subset of models around $M_{200} \sim 0.5-1.5 \times 10^{12}$ solar masses

alone cannot currently exclude potentials with $V_G > 850$ km/s. Finally,
specific constraints on the halo mass from HVS data are highly dependent on the
assumed baryonic mass potentials. This first attempt to simultaneously
constrain GC and dark halo properties is primarily hampered by the paucity and
quality of data. It nevertheless demonstrates the potential of our method, that
may be fully realised with the ESA Gaia mission.

Anomalies were clearly detected in five light curves and modelled as starspots

four transits over a period of 43 days. In the hypothesis that we are dealing

to the plasma-wall boundary. We focus on magnetic presheaths with a small
magnetic field to wall angle, $\alpha \ll 1$ (in radians). Characteristic
lengths perpendicular to the wall in such a magnetic presheath scale with the
typical ion Larmor orbit size, $\rho_{\text{i}}$. The smallest scale length
associated with variations parallel to the wall is taken to be across the
magnetic field, and ordered $l = \rho_{\text{i}} / \delta$, where $ \delta \ll
1$ is assumed. The scale lengths along the magnetic field line are assumed so
long that variations associated with this direction are neglected. These
orderings are consistent with what we expect close to the divertor target of a
tokamak. We allow for a strong component of the electric field $\vec{E}$ in the
direction normal to the electron repelling wall, with strong variation in the
same direction. The large change of the electric field over an ion Larmor
radius distorts the orbit so that it is not circular. We solve for the lowest
order orbits by identifying coordinates, which consist of constants of
integration, an adiabatic invariant and a gyrophase, associated with periodic
ion motion in the system with $\alpha = \delta = 0$. By using these new
coordinates as variables in the limit $\alpha \sim \delta \ll 1$, we obtain a
generalized ion gyrokinetic equation. We find another quantity that is
conserved to first order and use this to simplify the gyrokinetic equation,
solving it in the case of a collisionless magnetic presheath. Assuming a
Boltzmann response for the electrons, a form of the quasineutrality equation
that exploits the change of variables is derived. The gyrokinetic and
quasineutrality equations give the ion distribution function and electrostatic
potential in the magnetic presheath if the entrance boundary condition is
specified.

examine a decision version of the problem where the question asks whether the

if a given vector is in the span of all coset states. We approach this by first
computing an explicit basis for the coset space and the perpendicular space. We
then look at the consequences of having efficient unitaries that use this
basis. We show that if a unitary maps the basis to the standard basis in any
way, then that unitary can be used to solve random subset sum with constant
density $>1$. We also show that if a unitary can exactly decide membership in
the coset subspace, then the collision problem for subset sum can be solved for

strengthens the previous hardness result that implementing the optimal POVM in
a specific way is as hard as quantum sampling subset sum solutions.

of interactions satisfies the simple principles of unitarity, homogeneity,

information-theoretic derivation of the quantum theory of abstract systems to
include quantum field theory. The inherent discrete nature of the informational
axiomatization leads to an extension of quantum field theory to a quantum
cellular automata theory, where the usual field theory is recovered in a regime
where the discrete structure of the automata cannot be probed. A simple
heuristic argument sets the scale of discreteness to the Planck scale, and the
customary physical regime where discreteness is not visible is the relativistic
one of small wavevectors. In this paper we provide a thorough derivation from
principles that in the most general case the graph of the quantum cellular
automaton is the Cayley graph of a finitely presented group, and showing how
for the case corresponding to Euclidean emergent space (where the group resorts
to an Abelian one) the automata leads to Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell field dynamics

observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and
eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS.
This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13
(DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all
SDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes
publicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of
nearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It
includes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to
targeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected
objects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new
reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric
calibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the
APOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously
included and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For
the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric
calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with
DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and
an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and
format of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to
the important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data
reduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data,
tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the
reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that
will contain new data and analyses from the planned ~6-year operations of
SDSS-IV.

reversible Markov chain was not chosen from a stationary distribution. In
particular, given a value function for the states of the Markov chain, we would
like to demonstrate rigorously that the presented state is an outlier with
respect to the values, by establishing a $p$-value for observations we make
about the state under the null hypothesis that it was chosen uniformly at
random.
  A simple heuristic used in practice is to sample ranks of states from long
random trajectories on the Markov chain, and compare these to the rank of the
presented state; if the presented state is a $0.1\%$-outlier compared to the
sampled ranks (i.e., its rank is in the bottom $0.1\%$ of sampled ranks) then
this should correspond to a $p$-value of $0.001$. This test is not rigorous,
however, without good bounds on the mixing time of the Markov chain, as one
must argue that the observed states on the trajectory approximate the
stationary distribution.
  Our test is the following: given the presented state in the Markov chain,
take a random walk from the presented state for any number of steps. We prove
that observing that the presented state is an $\varepsilon$-outlier on the walk
is significant at $p=\sqrt {2\varepsilon}$, under the null hypothesis that the
state was chosen from a stationary distribution. Our result assumes nothing
about the structure of the Markov chain beyond reversibility, and we construct
examples to show that significance at $p\approx\sqrt \varepsilon$ is
essentially best possible in general. We illustrate the use of our test with a
potential application to the rigorous detection of gerrymandering in
Congressional districtings.

widespread among animals and humans alike. To study these situations,
theoretical and experimental works have adopted a game-theoretical perspective,
which has allowed to obtain valuable insights about human behavior. However,
most of the results reported so far have been obtained from a population
perspective and considered one specific conflicting situation at a time. This
makes it difficult to extract conclusions about the consistency of individuals'
behavior when facing different situations, and more importantly, to define a
comprehensive classification of the strategies underlying the observed
behaviors. Here, we present the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment in
which subjects face four different dyadic games, with the aim of establishing
general behavioral rules dictating individuals' actions. By analyzing our data
with an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we find that all the subjects
conform, with a large degree of consistency, to a limited number of behavioral
phenotypes (Envious, Optimist, Pessimist, and Trustful), with only a small
fraction of undefined subjects. We also discuss the possible connections to
existing interpretations based on a priori theoretical approaches. Our findings
provide a relevant contribution to the experimental and theoretical efforts
towards the identification of basic behavioral phenotypes in a wider set of
contexts without aprioristic assumptions regarding the rules or strategies
behind actions. From this perspective, our work contributes to a fact-based
approach to the study of human behavior in strategic situations, that could be
applied to simulating societies, policy-making scenario building and even for a
variety of business applications.

accurately measured in the broad kinetic energy range 1-350 GeV. In the higher
part of this range (E > 30 GeV) the e+ and pbar are both well described by
power laws with spectral indices gamma[e+] = 2.77 +-0.02 and gamma[pbar] = 2.78
+- 0.04 that are approximately equal to each other and to the spectral index of
protons.
  In the same energy range the positron/antiproton flux ratio has the
approximately constant value 2.04+-0.04, that is consistent with being equal to
the ratio e_/pbar calculated for the conventional mechanism of production,
where the antiparticles are created as secondaries in the inelastic
interactions of primary cosmic rays with interstellar gas.
  The positron/antiproton ratio at lower energy is significantly higher
(reaching the approximate value e+/pbar = 100 for E around 1 GeV), but in the
entire energy range 1-350 GeV, the flux ratio is consistent with being equal to
ratio of the production rates in the conventional mechanism, as the production
of low energy antiprotons is kinematically suppressed in collisions with a
target at rest.
  These results strongly suggest that cosmic ray positrons and antiprotons have
a common origin as secondaries in hadronic interactions. This conclusion has
broad implications for the astrophysics of cosmic rays in the Galaxy.

designs made up of connected and intertwined curves crosscuts a number of
related disciplines, including archaeology, art history, and heritage
management. However, many objects, such as pottery sherds found in the
archaeological record, are fragmentary, making the underlying complete designs
unknowable at the scale of the sherd fragment. The challenge to reconstruct and
study complete designs is stymied because 1) most fragmentary cultural-heritage
objects contain only a small portion of the underlying full design, 2) in the
case of a stamping application, the same design may be applied multiple times
with spatial overlap on one object, and 3) curve patterns detected on an object
are usually incomplete and noisy. As a result, classical curve-pattern matching
algorithms, such as Chamfer matching, may perform poorly in identifying the
underlying design. In this paper, we develop a new partial-to-global curve
matching algorithm to address these challenges and better identify the full
design from a fragmented cultural heritage object. Specifically, we develop the
algorithm to identify the designs of the carved wooden paddles of the
Southeastern Woodlands from unearthed pottery sherds. A set of pottery sherds
from the Snow Collection, curated at Georgia Southern University, are used to
test the proposed algorithm, with promising results.

  measurements","25 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-resolution functional imaging is providing increasingly rich
measurements of brain activity in animals and humans. A major challenge is to
leverage such data to gain insight into the brain's computational mechanisms.
The first step is to define candidate brain-computational models (BCMs) that
can perform the behavioural task in question. We would then like to infer,
which of the candidate BCMs best accounts for measured brain-activity data.
Here we describe a method that complements each BCM by a measurement model
(MM), which simulates the way the brain-activity measurements reflect neuronal
activity (e.g. local averaging in fMRI voxels or sparse sampling in array
recordings). The resulting generative model (BCM-MM) produces simulated
measurements. In order to avoid having to fit the MM to predict each individual
measurement channel of the brain-activity data, we compare the measured and
predicted data at the level of summary statistics. We describe a novel
particular implementation of this approach, called probabilistic RSA (pRSA)
with measurement models, which uses representational dissimilarity matrices
(RDMs) as the summary statistics. We validate this method by simulations of
fMRI measurements (locally averaging voxels) based on a deep convolutional
neural network for visual object recognition. Results indicate that the way the
measurements sample the activity patterns strongly affects the apparent
representational dissimilarities. However, modelling of the measurement process
can account for these effects and different BCMs remain distinguishable even
under substantial noise. The pRSA method enables us to perform Bayesian
inference on the set of BCMs and to recognise the data-generating model in each
case.

introduce the sample and present a detailed case study of the XMM-Newton
observation of the hot gas halo of NGC5908. After data calibration, point
source removal, and background analysis, we find that the diffuse soft X-ray
emission of NGC5908 is significantly more extended than the stellar light in
the vertical direction. The 0.5-1.25keV radial intensity profile tracing hot
gas emission can be detected above the background out to about $2^\prime$, or
$30\rm~kpc$ from the nucleus. The unresolved soft X-ray emission can be
characterized with a $\beta$-model with a slope of $\beta\approx0.68$. The
unresolved 0.5-2keV luminosity within $1^\prime$ is
$6.8\times10^{39}\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$, but young stellar sources may contribute
significantly to it. Assuming a metallicity of 0.2solar, an upper limit
(without subtracting the very uncertain young stellar contribution) to the mass
of hot gas within this radius is $2.3\times10^9\rm~M_\odot$. The cooling radius
is $r_{\rm cool}\approx25\rm~kpc$ or $\approx0.06r_{\rm 200}$, within which the
hot gas could cool radiatively in less than 10Gyr, and the cooling of hot gas
could significantly contribute in replenishing the gas consumed in star
formation. The hot gas accounts for $\approx1.9\%$ of the baryon detected
within the cooling radius. By comparing NGC5908 to other galaxies, we find that
its X-ray luminosity per stellar mass is consistent with lower-mass
non-starburst field spiral galaxies. However, a large scatter in hot gas soft
X-ray emissivity is indicated for spiral galaxies with
$M_*\gtrsim2\times10^{11}\rm~M_\odot$.

flat spacetime with a non-empty ergoregion $\mathscr{E}$ and no future event
horizon $\mathcal{H}^{+}$. On such spacetimes, Friedman provided a heuristic
argument that the energy of certain solutions $\phi$ of $\square_{g}\phi=0$
grows to $+\infty$ as time increases. In this paper, we provide a rigorous
proof of Friedman's instability. Our setting is, in fact, more general. We
consider smooth spacetimes $(\mathcal{M}^{d+1},g)$, for any $d\ge2$, not
necessarily globally real analytic. We impose only a unique continuation
condition for the wave equation across the boundary $\partial\mathscr{E}$ of
$\mathscr{E}$ on a small neighborhood of a point $p\in\partial\mathscr{E}$.
This condition always holds if $(\mathcal{M},g)$ is analytic in that
neighborhood of $p$, but it can also be inferred in the case when
$(\mathcal{M},g)$ possesses a second Killing field $\Phi$ such that the span of
$\Phi$ and the stationary Killing field $T$ is timelike on
$\partial\mathscr{E}$. We also allow the spacetimes $(\mathcal{M},g)$ under
consideration to possess a (possibly empty) future event horizon
$\mathcal{H}^{+}$, such that, however,
$\mathcal{H}^{+}\cap\mathscr{E}=\emptyset$ (excluding, thus, the Kerr exterior
family). As an application of our theorem, we infer an instability result for
the acoustical wave equation on the hydrodynamic vortex, a phenomenon first
investigated numerically by Oliveira, Cardoso and Crispino. Furthermore, as a
side benefit of our proof, we provide a derivation, based entirely on the
vector field method, of a Carleman-type estimate on the exterior of the
ergoregion for a general class of stationary and asymptotically flat
spacetimes.

short-range non-negative potential $V$ to the wave equation or under changes of
the metric $g_{M,a}$ in the far away region of $\mathcal{M}_{M,a}$ (retaining
the causality of $T$ there).
  In particular, we first establish, for any $0<|a|<M$, the existence of real
mode solutions $\psi$ to equation $\square_{g_{M,a}}\psi-V\psi=0$, for a
suitably chosen time-independent real potential $V$ with compact support in
space, satisfying $V\ge0$. Exponentially growing modes are also obtained after
perturbing the potential $V$. Then, as an application of the above result, we
construct a family of spacetimes $(\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a}^{(def)})$ which
are compact in space perturbations of $(\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a})$, have the
same symmetries as $(\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a})$ and moreover admit real and
exponentially growing modes. These spacetimes contain stably trapped null
geodesics, but we also construct a more complicated family of spacetimes with
normally hyperbolic trapped set, admitting real and exponentially growing
modes, at the expense of having conic asymptotics.
  The above results are in contrast with the case of stationary asymptotically
flat (or conic) spacetimes $(\mathcal{M},g)$ with a globally timelike Killing
field $T$, where real modes for equation $\square_{g}\psi-V\psi=0$ are always
absent, giving a useful zero-frequency continuity criterion for showing
stability for a smooth family of equations $\square_{g}\psi-V_{\lambda}\psi=0$,
with $\lambda\in[0,1]$ and $V_{0}=0$. We show explicitly that this criterion
fails on Kerr spacetime.

--- fast, intermediate and slow --- distinctly compress and heat up the
molecular gas, and so provide an important probe of the physical conditions

SHOCKFIND, to extract and characterise the mixture of shock families in MHD
turbulence. The algorithm is applied to a 3-dimensional simulation of a
magnetised turbulent molecular cloud, and we find that both fast and slow MHD
shocks are present in the simulation. We give the first prediction of the
mixture of turbulence-driven MHD shock families in this molecular cloud, and
present their distinct distributions of sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers. Using
subgrid one-dimensional models of MHD shocks we estimate that ~0.03 % of the
volume of a typical molecular cloud in the Milky Way will be shock heated above
50 K, at any time during the lifetime of the cloud. We discuss the impact of
this shock heating on the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds.

existing approaches to this problem. Unfortunately, providing relevant
reference images is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a novel

First, the retrieved reference images may frequently contain non-relevant
reference images, because even state-of-the-art place-recognition techniques
suffer from retrieval noise. Second, image comparison needs to be conducted in
a compressed domain to minimize the storage cost of large collections of
street-view images. To address the above issues, we also present a practical
change detection algorithm that uses compressed bag-of-words (BoW) image

reformulates the problem of loop closure detection as an instance of a

hypotheses are generated and verified in terms of the consistency between loop
closure hypotheses and VPR constraints at multiple viewpoints along the robot's
trajectory. Furthermore, we consider the general incremental setting of loop

entropy and information entropy. The generalized correlation dimension of
multifractals is based on Renyi entropy. However, the mathematical transform
from entropy to fractal dimension is not yet clear in both theory and practice.
This paper is devoted to revealing the new equivalence relation between spatial
entropy and fractal dimension using functional box-counting method. Based on
varied regular fractals, the numerical relationship between spatial entropy and
fractal dimension is examined. The results show that the ratio of actual
entropy (Mq) to the maximum entropy (Mmax) equals the ratio of actual dimension
(Dq) to the maximum dimension (Dmax). The spatial entropy and fractal dimension
of complex spatial systems can be converted into one another by means of
functional box-counting method. The theoretical inference is verified by
observational data of urban form. A conclusion is that normalized spatial
entropy is equal to normalized fractal dimension. Fractal dimensions proved to
be the characteristic values of entropies. In empirical studies, if the linear
size of spatial measurement is small enough, a normalized entropy value is
infinitely approximate to the corresponding normalized fractal dimension value.
Based on the theoretical result, new spatial measurements of urban space
filling can be defined, and multifractal parameters can be generalized to
describe both simple systems and complex systems.

slipping structures, indicative of reconnection downflow. The slipping motion
lasted about 40 min and the flux rope started to rise up slowly at the late
stage of the slippage. Then an X2.1 flare was initiated and the flux rope was
impulsively accelerated. One of the flare ribbons swept across a
negative-polarity sunspot and the penumbral segments of the sunspot decayed
rapidly after the flare. We studied the magnetic topology at the flaring region

observations imply that quasi-periodic slipping magnetic reconnection occurs
along the flux-rope-related QSLs in the preflare stage, which drives the later

Based on the newly established approximation by the $L_\infty$-norm of a normal
random vector, the critical value of the test can be evaluated by bootstrapping
from a multivariate normal distribution. In contrast to the conventional white
noise test, the new method is proved to be valid for testing the departure from
non-IID white noise. We illustrate the accuracy and the power of the proposed
test by simulation, which also shows that the new test outperforms several
commonly used methods including, for example, the Lagrange multiplier test and
the multivariate Box-Pierce portmanteau tests especially when the dimension of
time series is high in relation to the sample size. The numerical results also
indicate that the performance of the new test can be further enhanced when it
is applied to the pre-transformed data obtained via the time series principal
component analysis proposed by Chang, Guo and Yao (2014). The proposed
procedures have been implemented in an R-package HDtest and is available online

maximum when the embedding delay $\tau $ of the incomplete reconstruction
matches the time delay ${\tau _0}$ of the chaotic system. Numerical data

reported by Dammalapati \textit{et al.} in [Phys. Rev. A 93, 043407 (2016)].
These $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ were determined by plotting dynamic
polarizabilities ($\alpha$) of the involved states with the above transitions
against a desired range of wavelength. Electric dipole (E1) matrix elements
listed in [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 36, 497 (2007)], from the measured
lifetimes of the $7P_{1/2,3/2}$ states and from the calculations considering
core-polarization effects in the relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) method, were
used to determine $\alpha$. However, contributions from core correlation
effects and from the E1 matrix elements of the $7P-7S$, $7P-8S$ and $7P-6D$
transitions to $\alpha$ of the $7P$ states were ignored. In this work, we
demonstrate importance of these contributions and improve accuracies of
$\alpha$ further by replacing the E1 matrix elements taken from the HFR method
by the values obtained employing relativistic coupled-cluster theory. Our
static $\alpha$ are found to be in excellent agreement with the other available
theoretical results; whereas substituting the E1 matrix elements used by
Dammalapati \textit{et al.} give very small $\alpha$ values for the $7P$
states. Owing to this, we find disagreement in $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ reported
by Dammalapati \textit{et al.} for linearly polarized light; especially at
wavelengths close to the D-lines and in the infrared region. As a consequence,
a $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ reported at 797.75 nm which was seen supporting a blue
detuned trap in their work is now estimated at 771.03 nm and is supporting a
red detuned trap. Also, none of our results match with the earlier results for
circularly polarized light. Moreover, our static values of $\alpha$ will be
very useful for guiding experiments to carry out their measurements.

produce fast, wide-angle outflows. In this paper, we calculate the high-energy
gamma-ray emission arising from the blast waves driven by these wide-angle
outflows. We find that TeV emission arising from the inverse-Compton process in
the relativistic outflow resulted from mergers of binary BHs similar to those
in GW 150914 could be detectable by ground-based IACT telescopes such as
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) if the sources occur in { a dense medium with

mergers, TeV emission from the wide-angle, mildly-relativistic outflow could be
detected as well if they occur in a dense medium {with $n > 10-100 cm^{-3}$.}
Thus TeV afterglow emission would be a useful probe of the environment of the

investigation of the effect of reaction-step-size noise - uncertainty in the
step size of the reaction - on the dynamics of stochastic populations. This was
done by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of
stochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty
reproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include
subleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,
where notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and
reproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main
question we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the
overall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:
population extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets
extinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter
a population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards
extinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an
arbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty
reproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in
the metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time
to extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an
exponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the
bifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to
depend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our
formalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare
well with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.

from binaries consisting of a neutron star accreting from a low-mass white
dwarf or helium star where mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation.
However, the standard white-dwarf evolutionary channel cannot produce the
relatively long-period ($40 - 60$\,min) UCXBs with high time-averaged
mass-transfer rate. In this work, we explore an alternative evolutionary route
toward UCXBs where the companions evolve from intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars
with an anomalously strong magnetic field ($100 - 10000$\,G). Including the
magnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an
irradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,
we show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.
Using the \emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a
large number of IMXBs. The simulated results indicate that, for a small
wind-driving efficiency $f=10^{-5}$, the anomalous magnetic braking can drive
IMXBs to an ultra-short period of 11 min. Comparing our simulated results with
the observed parameters of fifteen identified UCXBs, the anomalous magnetic
braking evolutionary channel can account for the formation of seven and eight
sources with $f=10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. In particular, a
relatively large value of $f$ can fit three of the long-period, persistent
sources with high mass-transfer rate. Though the proportion of Ap/Bp stars in
intermediate-mass stars is only 5\%, the lifetime of the UCXB phase is
$\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr, producing a relatively high number of observable systems,
making this an alternative evolutionary channel for the formation of UCXBs.

bulk viscous dissipation and spatially extended molecular friction results in a
major decrease of both slip and bulk flow, thereby suppressing the fast water

connects smoothly with a parabolic profile in the bulk region. Such inverted

spectrum weight transfer and finite lifetime of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. In
the BCS regime, the superfluidity may be readily destroyed by the impurity of
high density. In comparison, the superfluidity in unitary and BEC regimes is
relatively more robust.

mitigating the effect of pilot contamination for the uplink of multi-cell
multiuser massive MIMO systems. The proposed hybrid pilot is designed such that
it enjoys the complementary advantages between time-multiplexed (TM) pilot and
time-superimposed (TS) pilot, and thereby, allows superior solution to the
conventional pilot schemes. We mathematically characterize the impact of hybrid
pilot on the massive MIMO uplink by deriving a closed-form approximation for
the uplink achievable rate. In large-number-of-antennas regime, we obtain the
asymptotically optimal solution for hybrid pilot by jointly designing the TM
pilot and the TS pilot. It is shown that either TM pilot or TS pilot has the
advantages for large frame-size and limited frame-size transmission,
respectively, while the hybrid pilot scheme can offer a superior performance to
that employing either TM pilot or TS pilot. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design.

fallback disk model, it is found that: (1) When the disk mass is significantly
smaller than $10^{-6} \,\rm M_{\odot}$, the magnetar is unaffected by the
fallback disk and it will be a normal magnetar. (2) When the disk mass is
large, but the magnetar's surface dipole field is about or below $10^{14} \,\rm

the magnetar will evolve from the ejector phase to the propeller phase, and
then enter rotational equilibrium. The magnetar will be slowed down quickly in
the propeller phase. The final rotational period can be as high $2\times 10^4

then of a vector multiplet that gauges the shift symmetry of the dilaton

inflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential, depending on
two extra parameters. This model is consistent with present cosmological
observations without modifying the low energy particle phenomenology associated
to the minimum of the scalar potential.
